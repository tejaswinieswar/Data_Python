Studies of the early childhood education program Head Start and the substance-abuse prevention program D.A.R.E. show that even when there are benefits, they are often modest and not enduring.'b'As a policy analyst who helped House Republicans design the 1996 welfare overhaul and who later advised President George W. Bush on social policy, I am committed to the principle that the government should fund only social welfare programs that work. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative that the new Congress reject efforts by some Republicans to 'b'cut'b' the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s evidence-based programs. Especially in a time of austerity, policy makers must know which programs work, and which don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'A growing body of evidence shows that a few model social programs \xe2\x80\x94 home visits to vulnerable families, K-12 education, pregnancy prevention, community college and employment training \xe2\x80\x94 produce solid impacts that can last for many years. Here are some examples.'b'At 24 mostly rural locations in Florida, 'b'Wyman\xe2\x80\x99s Teen Outreach Program'b' works with 6,000 ninth graders a year to promote healthy behaviors, life skills and a sense of purpose. Evaluations of the program, which is based on a nine-month curriculum, show that it helped reduce teen pregnancies and lowered the risk of school suspension and dropout.'b'At 160 elementary schools in low-income communities in California, Colorado, Maryland, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, Washington and the District of Columbia, a program called 'b'Reading Partners'b' pairs volunteer tutors with children for twice-weekly 45-minute sessions. An evaluation of the program in 19 schools across three states by the research firm M.D.R.C. found substantial improvements in reading skills.'b'In Lancaster County, Pa., the 'b'Nurse-Family Partnership'b' serves 175 low-income, first-time moms. Nurses start visiting the mothers before birth and continue, with diminishing frequency, until the child is 2. The nurses are trained to form a close relationship with the mother and advise her on prenatal health and child-rearing issues \xe2\x80\x94 including smoking and drinking during pregnancy and planning future pregnancies \xe2\x80\x94 and on life skills. Typically, 20 to 30 visits are involved. Three randomized controlled trials have shown that the program has major impacts that last at least until the child is 15. The mothers who participated were less likely to abuse or neglect their kids, and more likely to be working, and their kids were more likely to be healthy and ready for school.'b''b'Success for All'b', a comprehensive schoolwide reform program, primarily for high-poverty elementary schools, emphasizes early detection and prevention of reading problems before they become serious. Students of various ages who read at the same performance level are grouped together and receive daily, 90-minute reading classes, as well as one-on-one tutoring and cooperative learning activities. We know it works because a study that randomly assigned 41 schools across 11 states to an experimental or control group found improved reading skills, including comprehension, in students in the experimental group. Most of the students were black or Hispanic, and from low-income families. Success for All was awarded $50 million to more than double its network of schools over five years, to train teachers and to improve effectiveness in new sites.'b'Expansion of these programs has been possible because the Obama administration, building on work by the Bush administration, has insisted that money for evidence-based initiatives go primarily to programs with rigorous evidence of success, as measured by scientifically designed evaluation. (Continuing evaluation is necessary because programs that work in one location can fail when implemented by new organizations in different locations.) Since 2010, these principles have been the basis for competitive grants to more than 1,400 programs across the country.'b'Over time, an evidence-based approach should be a prerequisite for any program to get federal dollars. Shamefully, this has not been the case. When John M. Bridgeland led Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s Domestic Policy Council, he was amazed to find 339 federal programs for disadvantaged youth, administered by 12 departments and agencies, at a cost of $224 billion. Very few had been evaluated to determine whether they made a difference.'b'The evidence-based movement separates the wheat from the chaff. If this movement spreads to more federal programs, especially the big education, employment and health programs supported by formula-based grants, we can expect consternation and flailing as many program operators discover that their programs are part of the chaff.'b'This is why rigorous evaluation is often unpopular, for politicians in both parties. Historically, Democrats have been criticized for throwing money at intractable problems, while Republicans have been depicted as heartlessly assuming that social spending never works. The truth is, of course, more complex. Since Lyndon B. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s Great Society, disjointed, inefficient, poorly implemented social programs have been created and funded without vigorous assessment. Years of failure have taught us that humans are difficult to change.'b'The Obama evidence-based initiative has charted a new path that could reduce poverty and increase economic opportunity for the disadvantaged. Rather than cut these programs, Congress should extend funding so that successful programs can expand to new sites while programs that are not working are improved or abandoned. Social policy is too important to be left to guesswork.'b'The most significant animal welfare law in recent history \xe2\x80\x94 California\xe2\x80\x99s Prop 2 \xe2\x80\x94 takes effect today. The measure, which passed by a 'b'landslide'b' vote in 2008, requires egg and some meat producers to confine their animals in far more humane conditions than they did before. No longer will baby calves (veal) or gestational pigs be kept in crates so small they cannot turn around and, perhaps more significantly, egg-laying hens may not be held in \xe2\x80\x9cbattery\xe2\x80\x9d cages that prevent them from spreading their wings.'b'The regulations don\xe2\x80\x99t affect only hens kept in California. In 2010, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law a bill that extended the protections of Prop 2 to out-of-state birds: You cannot sell an egg in California from a hen kept in extreme confinement anywhere. For an industry that has been able to do pretty much what it wants, this is a big deal: It bans some of the most egregious practices.'b'Does limiting confinement for hens mean the end of cages? Maybe. It might become impractical for growers to build bigger cages; that is, it might be easier simply to keep hens in groups that meet the new minimum area required per bird, and so keep the hens \xe2\x80\x9ccage free.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s not a panacea, but it is an improvement.'b'The new minimum is not specified in numbers, but the courts have said that it \xe2\x80\x9cestablishes a clear test that any law enforcement officer can apply, and that test does not require the law enforcement officer to have the investigative acumen of Columbo to determine if an egg farmer is in violation.\xe2\x80\x9d Hens must be able to spread their wings without touching a cage or another bird.'b'There is, however, another new state regulation \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called shell egg food safety regulation, aimed at reducing salmonella \xe2\x80\x94 enacted by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. This requires a minimum of 116 square inches per bird, compared with the current 67 square inches, which is less space than an 8-by-10 photo, and just a tad more than a standard iPad.'b'Prop 2 trumps this rule, and birds probably need more than 116 square inches to spread their wings. In fact, many experts think something closer to 200 square inches is more realistic. But some farmers may think they can get away with 116; law enforcement will determine whether they\xe2\x80\x99re right, and noncompliance is a criminal offense.'b'The new regulations will probably raise the price of eggs. Surprisingly, as producers in California switch production systems to comply with the new law, eggs raised by so-called conventional means sometimes 'b'cost more than cage-free eggs'b'. This belies the arguments that the conversion process is difficult or prohibitively expensive; it just shows that many producers failed to take advantage of the five years between the extension of the new housing standards to all birds, and its taking effect, to adequately prepare. What have they been doing instead? Predictably, filing lawsuits fighting Prop 2, all of which have failed.'b'That Prop 2 is supported by a majority of people in the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest ag state, and that its legitimacy has been supported by courts, shows the direction in which the raising of animals is headed. 'b'Gestation crates are on their way out'b', and battery cages will soon join them. With this measure, the table is set for similar action in states all over the country.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve worked on passing anti-confinement laws in 10 states now,\xe2\x80\x9d says Paul Shapiro, a spokesperson at the Humane Society of the United States. At least three other states are to take up similar legislation in 2015.'b'The most important part of the new law may be that every whole egg sold in California must adhere to the standards set by Prop 2, regardless of where it\xe2\x80\x99s from. And since California can\xe2\x80\x99t raise all the eggs eaten by its citizens, millions of those eggs \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps as many as a third consumed in the state \xe2\x80\x94 will come from elsewhere. From Iowa, for example, where more than 14 billion eggs are produced each year. (Interesting: There are just over 3 million people in Iowa, and nearly 60 million laying hens.) There has been talk of shortages, but they would be short-lived.'b'So, in California, just as you had to meet higher emission standards than required by federal law if you wanted to sell cars, now you must meet higher welfare standards for hens if you want to sell eggs. Whether farmers comply, or disobey, or leave the business remains to be seen. But Prop 2 means a new norm; eventually it will be, well, normal.'b'Just how high are the standards set by Prop 2? \xe2\x80\x9cBy itself, the law means that many millions of animals will no longer be held in cramped cages, and that\xe2\x80\x99s huge,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr. Shapiro. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the message it sends to the factory farming industry is clear: Business as usual \xe2\x80\x94 that is, subjecting animals to torturous conditions for their entire lives \xe2\x80\x94 is no longer going to be acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For the second time this year, a passenger plane has vanished midflight. In March, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared and the 'b'most expensive'b' search mission in recent aviation history followed. It is still missing.'b'On Sunday, AirAsia Flight 8501 disappeared off the coast of Indonesia. It took about two days for search teams to 'b'find debris'b'. As of Wednesday, the reason for the accident was still unknown.'b'These similar incidents suggest that the current system for tracking aircraft \xe2\x80\x94 via ground-based radar and satellite \xe2\x80\x94 is insufficient. It\xe2\x80\x99s shocking that two planes carrying hundreds of people could go missing, especially given advances in wireless communication.'b'From a technological standpoint, it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to outfit aircraft to stream flight-data in real-time. Carriers have been reluctant to do so because in-flight disasters are rare, and streaming is costly. But shaken by the loss of Flight 370, the aviation industry and aviation regulators are coming around to the need for change.'b'In the spring, the Malaysia Transport Ministry issued a 'b'preliminary report'b' on Flight 370 with a single recommendation: that the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 International Civil Aviation Organization examine the safety benefits of introducing a standard for real-time tracking.'b'Earlier this month, an industry group, the International Air Transport Association, released its own voluntary standard: Within one year\xe2\x80\x99s time, all aircraft should report their positions at least every 15 minutes, and more often during emergencies.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s reason to suspect that the 15-minute standard, which is far short of live-streaming, is too lax. In 2009, Air France Flight 447 disappeared over the Atlantic. Search crews found debris within days, but it took nearly two years to recover the \xe2\x80\x9cblack box\xe2\x80\x9d containing flight data. That aircraft had been programmed to transmit its position 'b'every 10 minutes'b'.'b'The 15-minute standard also lags behind the most advanced airlines, like AirAsia, which, according to 'b'The Wall Street Journal'b', has already started modifying some of its aircraft to send position updates every 2 minutes. But the plane that disappeared had not been upgraded.'b'Some carriers have objected to the I.A.T.A.\xe2\x80\x99s upgrade schedule as too aggressive. For Flight 8501, the process was too slow.'b'Back at the turn of the century, when China began trying to crack down on the Internet, Bill Clinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cGood luck. That\xe2\x80\x99s sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He seems to have underestimated the ingenuity and commitment of Chinese censors, who in intervening years have put up the Great Firewall, some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most sophisticated machinery and software for controlling or blocking what reaches millions of Chinese Internet users. Many foreign services, including Twitter and Facebook, are blocked altogether, and the list grows by the week.'b'But the technical ability to nail Jell-O to the wall does not necessarily make it useful or desirable, as China 'b'demonstrated last Friday'b', when many users of Gmail in China found the service shut down.'b'Most of Google\xe2\x80\x99s services have been disrupted since June, but until last week Gmail could still be accessed by its many Chinese users over protocols like SMTP or POP. These, too, went down. Chinese officials claimed to be flummoxed by the problem. But it looked for all the world like another attempt by China\xe2\x80\x99s Internet nannies to either patch a hole in the Great Firewall or to intimidate Google, the biggest thorn in their sides.'b'Google is among the Western technology companies that have refused to bow to China\xe2\x80\x99s idea of \xe2\x80\x9cInternet sovereignty,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes sharing information on users with the government. The company moved its servers out of China in 2010, and all of its services \xe2\x80\x94 including its search function \xe2\x80\x94 were shut down in China in the crackdown on foreign Internet services in the months leading up to the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests.'b'Though there is no solid evidence that China blocked Gmail, or indications of why it might have, the fact is that China faces a dilemma in dealing with Western information giants. The free flow of information and the potential for quick popular mobilization through social networks are anathema to the authoritarian state, and China has gone to great lengths to control what comes in.'b'But as a rapidly developing economic powerhouse, China also needs the instant communications, quick research and management tools of the technology giants. Gmail is especially popular with Chinese doing business with Western companies, and many publicly complained about the interruption. The technology companies, for their part, salivate at the vast and rich Chinese market but bridle at the control and censorship China demands as the price for participating.'b'Frustration with the interruption of Gmail service seemed to reach even into the Communist nomenklatura. Global Times, a tabloid associated with the state-owned People\xe2\x80\x99s Daily, carried 'b'a curious editorial'b' saying that \xe2\x80\x9cif the China side indeed blocked Gmail, the decision must have been prompted by newly emerged security reasons. If that is the case, Gmail users need to accept the reality of Gmail being suspended in China. But we hope it is not the case.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Or, Global Times might have said, it may be possible to nail Gmail to the wall, but it\xe2\x80\x99s really not a good idea.'b'In some ways, the decision by President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to 'b'force a losing vote on Palestinian statehood'b' at the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday and then 'b'sign papers to join the International Criminal Court'b' on Wednesday was not surprising.'b'At nearly 80, he has to be tired and deeply frustrated with the failure of years of peace negotiations with Israel to achieve the Palestinian dream of an independent state. He has seen his popularity and credibility plummet as he competed for the support of his people with Hamas, the militant group that would rather lob missiles at Israel than recognize it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have to take some meaningful steps to recover anything of their really shredded credibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Nadia Hijab, executive director of Al-Shabaka: The Palestinian Policy Network, 'b'said of Mr. Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s team'b' in an interview with The Times.'b'And, in truth, prospects for a two-state solution grow dimmer by the day, with right-wing Israeli politicians opposing a Palestinian state and the Israeli government, led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, steadily expanding settlements, making the creation of a viable Palestinian state harder.'b'But Mr. Abbas\xe2\x80\x99s actions will almost certainly make the situation worse, setting back the cause of statehood even farther. By taking this tack before the Israeli elections, which are set for March 17, he has given Israeli hard-liners new ammunition to attack the Palestinians and reject new peace talks. And he may have set in motion the collapse of the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 self-governing authority.'b'Mr. Abbas began this week by insisting that the Security Council approve a resolution to set a deadline for establishing a Palestinian state, including the phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank by the end of 2017. After heavy lobbying by the United States and Israel, the resolution received only eight of the nine votes needed to pass in the 15-member council. The fact is, the United States, which voted against the measure, supports a Palestinian state. And France, which broke with the Americans and voted in favor, acknowledged reservations about some of the details.'b'Following this defeat, Mr. Abbas moved swiftly on Wednesday to take an even more provocative step in joining the International Criminal Court, through which the Palestinians could bring charges against Israeli officials for cases against their settlement activities and military operations.'b'While he was under strong pressure from his constituents to do this, he knew well the cost might be great. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is aggression practiced against our land and our country, and the Security Council has let us down \xe2\x80\x94 where shall we go?\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Mr. Abbas said 'b' at his headquarters in the West Bank city of Ramallah.'b'The United States Congress had long threatened to impose sanctions against the Palestinian Authority, including the loss of about 'b'$400 million'b' in annual aid, if it joined the court. Israel could withhold tens of millions of dollars in tax remittances, as it has before, and could move more aggressively to build settlements in sensitive areas. 'b'Mr. Netanyahu'b' also said the Palestinians may now be subject to prosecution over support for Hamas.'b'How the European Union, another major donor to the Palestinians, might react is unclear. Even though the United States and Israel may want to punish the Palestinian Authority, hasty retaliation could trigger the authority\xe2\x80\x99s collapse and impose major new burdens on Israel.'b'Under agreements with the court signed by Mr. Abbas, the Palestinians cannot file a complaint against Israel for up to 90 days. They would be wise to delay any action until at least after the Israeli election, when voters will have a chance to decide the country\xe2\x80\x99s leadership. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that the crisis Mr. Abbas has provoked could bring about fresh consideration of the compromises that both sides need to make to allow their peoples to live in peace.

Three classmates, Ayyana Chakravartula, Susan Dodge King and Alexis Newbrand Cooke, also signed the letter. 'b''b'The second of the two police officers ambushed and gunned down in Brooklyn by Ismaaiyl Brinsley will be laid to rest Sunday.'b'As was the case with the first funeral, the city and the nation should pause and pay tribute. All lives are precious.'b'But when the eulogies trail off and the tears dry, we must once again wrestle with the reasons we have arrived at this place, the underlying, unresolved issues: police-community relations, functional bias in policing, disparities in use of force.'b'We have to truly understand the politics \xe2\x80\x94 racial, economic and class-related \xe2\x80\x94 playing out before our eyes and to realize that those politics have an antecedent. There is a history here that cannot be repeated.'b'In 1988, a 22-year-old rookie police officer named 'b'Edward Byrne was ambushed and killed'b' on the orders of a drug lord while guarding a witness in Queens. This was a true tragedy. 'b'More than 10,000 officers mourned him'b' at his funeral. When Byrne was murdered, the mayor was Ed Koch, a Democrat like the current mayor, Bill de Blasio.'b'One of the four men charged in Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s murder 'b'said on a videotape'b' after his arrest that the killing was meant to send the message that \xe2\x80\x9cwe lose one, they lose one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Before killing officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, Brinsley apparently 'b'posted on an Instagram account'b': \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m putting wings on pigs today\xe2\x80\xa6they take one of ours, let\xe2\x80\x99s take two of theirs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That, however, is where the similarities end. The 1988 murder was the instrument of organized criminals; the recent murders were the outcry of one deranged man trying \xe2\x80\x94 but failing \xe2\x80\x94 to latch on to the cause of organized protests.'b'Yet political strategists regularly see opportunity in tragedy. It happened in the case of Byrne, and we must guard against it happening again.'b'In 1988, George H. W. Bush was running his tough-on-crime campaign against Michael S. Dukakis, and successfully using Willie Horton \xe2\x80\x94 a black murderer who raped a white woman while on furlough from prison \xe2\x80\x94 as a weapon against Dukakis.'b'That year, a few weeks before the election, Bush made his first campaign appearance in the general election in New York City surrounding himself with uniformed policemen and accepting Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s badge from his father. Bush 'b'said at the event'b' that he wanted to use the occasion \xe2\x80\x9cto help define for you the man I am running against, throw a little red political meat out there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bush won the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police that year, and he carried 40 states on Election Day, delivering a crushing blow to Dukakis and the Democrats. Bush would say later that he kept Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s badge in the Oval Office.'b'Also in 1988, the Byrne Formula Grant Program, named after the fallen officer, was established by the Anti-Drug Abuse Act to supercharge the war on drugs \xe2\x80\x94 a 'b'disastrous boondoggle'b' that would come to be a war waged primarily against marijuana usage by black men. As the 'b'American Civil Liberties Union pointed out in 2011'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThe racial disparities are staggering: despite the fact that whites engage in drug offenses at a higher rate than African-Americans, 'b'African-Americans are incarcerated for drug offenses at a rate that is 10 times greater than that of whites'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Democrats, determined to never be outflanked on crime again, began to move dramatically to the right, in some case further to the right than Republicans themselves.'b'In 1989, 'b'Mayor Koch spoke of Byrne\xe2\x80\x99s killing'b' and those of other officers, saying ominously, \xe2\x80\x9cThe pendulum protecting those who violate the law has swung too far.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 1992, the Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Bush over Bill Clinton, although Clinton gained the endorsements of two smaller police unions. But in 1994, 'b'Clinton championed a crime bill'b' to have the federal government pay for 100,000 additional police officers, a move The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Fact Checker blog says \xe2\x80\x9ccertainly helped neutralize G.O.P. attacks about Democrats being weak on crime.\xe2\x80\x9d So, in 1996, 'b'CNN reported'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a first for a Democratic presidential candidate, President Bill Clinton picked up the endorsement of the Fraternal Order of Police.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The group then 'b'endorsed John McCain'b' over President Obama in 2008, but Obama was able to secure the endorsement of the National Association of Police Organizations, whose president said:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSenators Barack Obama and Joe Biden have a proven record of standing with the law enforcement community, from giving our officers on the front lines the resources and tools they need in the fight against drugs and crime in our communities to supporting law enforcement officers\xe2\x80\x99 right to work place protections.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For one thing, 'b'Obama had promised'b' that he would restore funding to the Byrne Grants program, which Bush had sought to eliminate. Conservative groups backed Bush\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to eliminate the program, saying it \xe2\x80\x9chas proved to be an ineffective and inefficient use of resources.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But as I wrote in a 'b'2010 column'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the last year of the Bush administration, financing had been reduced to $170 million. In March of that year, 'b'56 senators signed'b' onto a \xe2\x80\x98bipartisan\xe2\x80\x99 letter to ranking members of the Senate Appropriations Committee urging them to restore nearly $500 million to the program. Only 15 Republicans signed the letter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some of this motive might have had to do with conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 deep contempt for unions, but that is another matter.'b'When accepting the endorsement, Obama issued a statement saying:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDay and night, America\xe2\x80\x99s police work tirelessly to make sure that our families are safe and our communities are strong. It\xe2\x80\x99s a basic responsibility to make sure that our officers have the support they need to fight crime and bring criminals to justice. Too often under the Bush Administration, we\xe2\x80\x99ve failed to live up to that obligation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And, as Zaid Jilani 'b'wrote on Alternet'b' in early December, Joe Biden \xe2\x80\x9cwas the 'b'chief author of the 1994 crime bill'b', which vastly increased the number of police officers on American streets, eliminated Pell Grants for prisoners, expanded the federal death penalty and upped the Border Patrol presence (recall that this bill was passed around the same time as NAFTA, which 'b'increased migration from Mexico'b').\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obama followed though on his promise. As my 2010 column pointed out: \xe2\x80\x9cThe 2009 stimulus package presented these Democrats with the opportunity, and they seized it. The legislation, designed by Democrats and signed by President Obama, included 'b'$2 billion for Byrne Grants'b' to be awarded by the end of September 2010. That was nearly a 12-fold increase in financing. Whatever the merits of these programs, they are outweighed by the damage being done. Financing prevention is fine. Financing a race-based arrest epidemic is not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 2012, the National Association of Police Organizations 'b'again endorsed the Obama/Biden ticket'b', They touted the administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunwavering support,\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere are simply no better friends of law enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 and no stronger choice to lead this nation for another term \xe2\x80\x94 than President Obama and Vice President Biden.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the way politics work in this country: Special interest appeasement ultimately leads to bad policy. Conservatives too often sacrifice the middle class to the moneyed class, and liberals too often sacrifice the lowest class to the union class. No one really looks out for the poor and disadvantaged, at least not as a first order of business, because they have the least power and are least able to help finance campaigns.'b'And yet Democrats have realized that they are in bed with fickle partners. When the protests erupted after grand juries did not indict police officers in the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, the president, the attorney general and the mayor of New York had what I imagine some viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cthe audacity\xe2\x80\x9d to weigh in with how they personally saw tensions between the police and communities of color, how those tensions had personally affected their lives and their understanding of the protesters\xe2\x80\x99 feelings.'b'When the two officers were killed, no time was wasted in attempts to tie all these political figures to the killings. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani even 'b'said'b', \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had four months of propaganda, starting with the president, that everybody should hate the police,\xe2\x80\x9d a claim that The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s Fact Checker gave four Pinocchios, the worst rating.'b'And the National Association of Police Organizations, which had so effusively praised Obama and Biden, 'b'chimed in'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPoliticians have created an environment of extreme hostility in communities across the nation. Our nation\xe2\x80\x99s leaders continue to crucify and demonize law enforcement officers as these officers work tirelessly and selflessly to protect us. When will this end? When will our leaders work with us, not against us, to build trust between officers and the communities that they serve?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The truth is closer to what 'b'Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wisely wrote'b' last week in Time magazine:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPolice are not under attack, institutionalized racism is. Trying to remove sexually abusive priests is not an attack on Catholicism, nor is removing ineffective teachers an attack on education. Bad apples, bad training, and bad officials who blindly protect them, are the enemy. And any institution worth saving should want to eliminate them, too.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And yet that\xe2\x80\x99s what some would have you believe is the subtext now: anti-police vs. pro-police, or more disturbingly, black crime \xe2\x80\x94 as embodied by Brinsley \xe2\x80\x94 versus civility \xe2\x80\x94 as enabled by the police. In this construct, anti-police-brutality protesters became proxy for raging criminality, which in the poisoned American mind is emblematic of blackness itself, a thing in need of suppression \xe2\x80\x94 to be controlled, crushed \xe2\x80\x94 lest it surge.'b'The mind that cannot separate Brinsley from other black folks, that simply sees dark skin and sees darkness, is diseased: It was never serious and isn\xe2\x80\x99t salvageable. But, just as important, operatives who would use tragedy as political leverage are morally subordinated to those who use tragedy as an impetus to seek social justice.'b'As Prof. Harry Levine, a sociologist at the City University of New York, told me via email:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cByrne\xe2\x80\x99s death was used to step up the long-term growth and institutionalization of the drug war. Now, the deaths of officers Ramos and Liu are being used to defend how policing has been done for twenty years under a regime called \xe2\x80\x98broken windows,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98zero tolerance,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98quality of life,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98order maintenance,\xe2\x80\x99 and which focuses chiefly on the ordinary residents of black and Latino neighborhoods.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a way, one could argue that many of the things the protesters were about \xe2\x80\x94 institutional police bias, over-policing, bloated police forces, police militarization \xe2\x80\x94 can be traced in some way back to the policies that sprang up after Byrne was killed, including the one in his name.'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t allow another tragedy to be corrupted in that way. We must remain vigilant. The protests have a purpose: to find a true peace by first disturbing the false one, to use disruptive means as a way of moving closer to restorative justice. The cynical cannot use the savage to impose silence. Political leaders cannot be allowed to cave in to police pressure. They must weather public pressure born of racial and tribal impulses. They must stand for justice and equality, always.'b'Society must be policed, but fairly so. Areas of concentrated poverty sometimes require the most policing, but when people begin to be punished for being poor rather than committing crimes, the core mission is corrupted. When police forces become suppressive rather than protective, the core mission is corrupted. When officers who are entrusted with power feel enshrined by it, the core mission is corrupted.'b'The protests drew attention to that corruption, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they were, and will remain, important. They are somewhat outside, and in a way above, the cesspool of politics that led us here.'b'BANGKOK \xe2\x80\x94  Fifteen billion dollars. That\xe2\x80\x99s roughly the price tag of the coup d\xe2\x80\x99\xc3\xa9tat to date. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between the Thai economy, Southeast Asia\xe2\x80\x99s second-biggest, stagnating, as it is now, or its chugging along at 4 percent, its average growth rate since 2001.'b'When a group of generals led by Prayuth Chan-ocha toppled the democratically elected government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra last May, their political agenda was clear: They wanted to quell a mounting legitimacy crisis. For many weeks protesters had been taking to the streets to condemn Ms. Shinawatra\xe2\x80\x99s management of the economy and a controversial amnesty bill that would have benefited her brother Thaksin, a former prime minister in self-exile whose political parties have dominated Thai politics since 2001.'b'Now the economic consequences of the military takeover have become plain. The protests that precipitated the coup had already slowed growth, partly because of blocks on government borrowing, stalled exports and a restrictive monetary policy. And the situation has hardly improved since.'b'The Bank of Thailand recently slashed its projections for G.D.P. growth for 2014 from 1.5 percent to 0.8 percent \xe2\x80\x94 compared with 2.9 percent in 2013, before the coup, according to the National Economic and Social Development Board (N.E.S.D.B.), Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s state economic planning agency. Rather than achieve what the official propaganda claims \xe2\x80\x94 order, stability, growth \xe2\x80\x94 the return to old-fashioned autocracy threatens to bring economic near-stagnation and will likely increase income inequality.'b'The takeover in May was at least the 12th military coup in Thailand since 1932, the year constitutional monarchy was introduced. When generals have taken power in the past, they have used the opportunity to develop the country. There was rapid economic growth from 1983 until 1996, largely under Gen. Prem Tinsulanonda, who held office until 1988. Back then the economy got a jolt from a major devaluation of the currency (the baht) and a series of measures designed to promote rapid industrialization by encouraging foreign investment (mostly from Japan), infrastructure expansion and industrial exports.'b'In theory, the current junta could also make a big economic contribution. But in a bid to scour the system of Mr. Thaksin\xe2\x80\x99s influence, the generals have been turning their backs on many policies favored by his government, including those that worked.'b'Mr. Thaksin\xe2\x80\x99s signature economic achievement was to encourage consumption among lower-class people: His government provided access to affordable health care, gave out credits to rural communities, and created a transfer system benefiting poor students and old people. Today, the generals are reducing transfers to lower-income groups, concentrating on unfocused infrastructure expansion and taking no action to increase exports or tourism.'b'This will not do in the face of Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s aging population and broken educational system, and of the global economic slowdown. Especially not when stagnation already threatens the social contract. The N.E.S.D.B. reckons that 0.1 percent of Thais own nearly half of the country\xe2\x80\x99s assets. Capitalist America, where 0.1 percent of the population owns one-fifth of all assets, looks like a socialist paradise in comparison.'b'Some simple, well-known measures could do much immediate good. The central bank could spur stagnating exports and tourism by buying U.S. dollars to drive down the baht. The government could boost private consumption with a massive transfer program to farmers, students and the elderly. The Bank of Thailand could make credit more readily available by increasing the money supply, and it could stop using interests rate to manage monetary policy, which has not been effective.'b'Yet the chances of such policies being implemented are low. The Bank of Thailand seems crippled by conservatism and uncertainty. Fiscal policy is in the hands of bureaucrats who are fearful of spending public money. The generals\xe2\x80\x99 own support base is too narrow for them to suggest, much less achieve, anything contentious. And some of their economic proposals so far have been essentially nationalistic and risk discouraging foreign investment.'b'Every rational path out of stagnation seems blocked by autocratic rule. Thailand is not, as many economists argue, in a middle-income trap; it is in a coup trap. And this is a self-inflicted condition.'b'To raise the economic welfare of all Thais, and reduce the economic inequalities that have underlain political conflicts, by our estimation Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s G.D.P. growth rate would have to be brought up to at least 6 percent. For that, though, bold measures are needed.'b'Small and medium-sized investors need to be given greater access to credit. The financial sector must be made more competitive, including with the creation of new lending institutions, ideally more domestic commercial banks. The junta should also encourage more foreign direct investment in high technology, both to increase productivity in existing manufacturing (such as the automotive industry) and to spur higher-value manufacturing (such as for pharmaceuticals and telecommunication products).'b'In the 1980s and 1990s, Thailand developed its Eastern Seaboard by turning infrastructure built in the Gulf of Thailand during the Vietnam War into one of Asia\xe2\x80\x99s greatest production and export platforms, especially for automobiles and petrochemical products. A similarly grand strategy today might be to revive this old idea: creating an alternative route to the Strait of Malacca, the world\xe2\x80\x99s busiest shipping lane, by digging a canal through the Kra Isthmus, in southern Thailand. A diversified manufacturing belt could then be developed along the canal, with two new great ports on either end. Another option would be to build a vast economic zone in the north and northeast of Thailand to supply the Chinese market.'b'The generals claim to want to address all these issues urgently. They must adopt a bold approach to overcome bureaucratic inertia or else recovery will be slow. Reviving the economy is their single best chance of justifying the coup and stabilizing the country.'b''b'\n'b'Forrest E. Cookson 'b' is an economist. 'b'Tom  F. Joehnk 'b' writes for The Economist. 'b''b'In Russia, where religious holidays have not supplanted secular ones, New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve is much more important than Christmas. The fact that the country\xe2\x80\x99s biggest holiday marks the turn of the calendar illustrates the special relationship Russians \xe2\x80\x94 and particularly their rulers \xe2\x80\x94 have with time.'b'Historically, many Russian leaders have fallen into two broad categories: those who tried to freeze time (Czar Nicholas I and Leonid Brezhnev, for example), and those who wanted to speed it up (Peter the Great, Alexander II, Nikita Khrushchev). The former group worshiped tradition, the latter emphasized change. In any case, attempts to turn back the clock have always alternated with outbursts of frenetic activity.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe choice is either death or catching up with and overtaking the advanced capitalist countries,\xe2\x80\x9d Lenin warned his cohorts. And Stalin, in defending his forced industrialization program, declared: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are 50 or a 100 years behind the advanced countries. We must run that same distance in 10 years. Either we do it or they crush us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Vladimir V. Putin defies both these categories, yet when it comes to keeping power, his sense of timing is masterful. Take the case of the popular opposition figure Aleksei A. Navalny, who was scheduled to be sentenced on politically motivated embezzlement charges on Jan. 15. Suddenly, as the threat of protests loomed, the government rescheduled the sentencing to this past Tuesday. And instead of the 10-year prison term prosecutors had requested, Navalny received a suspended sentence. But his brother and co-defendant, Oleg, was sentenced to three and a half years in jail, a ruling that many saw as a way to punish Alexei obliquely.'b'There was nothing really unusual about this. Many Russian rulers have aspired to be masters of time \xe2\x80\x94 including the time they spend at the seat of power. No Russian reign has ever had predefined limits. Most pre-revolutionary rulers died on the throne, or were overthrown and murdered. As hereditary monarchs, the czars\xe2\x80\x99 days in power were limited only by accident, disease or their relatives\xe2\x80\x99 eagerness to take their place. Nicholas II abdicated in 1917 but was later shot by the Bolshevik political police.'b'Soviet leaders, except for Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev, also held their posts for life. Khrushchev, overthrown by the party leadership in 1964, was the first to live to write his memoirs and die of natural causes. Gorbachev not so much vacated the seat of power as saw it slip from under him as the Soviet Union disintegrated in 1991. Boris Yeltsin, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s first post-Soviet president, resigned at the end of 1999, thus becoming the first Russian leader to relinquish the post voluntarily.'b'Dmitri A. Medvedev, the current prime minister, served one full presidential term between 2008 and 2012. Though there was a chance, however slim, for him to seek a second term, cynics (or, if you prefer, realists) knew that he was merely a placeholder for Mr. Putin. In a perfectly timed switch, the two men traded places in 2012.'b'Unfortunately for their countrymen, the move will keep Russia behind the times and out of step with its immediate neighbors. In a recent Foreign Affairs article, \xe2\x80\x9cNormal Countries: The East 25 Years After Communism,\xe2\x80\x9d the social scientists Andrei Shleifer and Daniel Treisman divide post-Soviet bloc nations into \xe2\x80\x9cradical,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgradual\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cslow\xe2\x80\x9d reformers. They find that the faster and more thorough the reforms, the less economic pain. \xe2\x80\x9cThe gradual reformers eventually caught up to the radical reformers,\xe2\x80\x9d they write, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not before suffering many years of costly underperformance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another interesting finding is that post-Communist nations, while trying to catch up with the West, tend to emulate their neighbors. The Baltic states have learned from Finland; those of Central Europe from Austria and Germany; the countries of the Caucasus from Iran and Turkey. The economies of those countries once out of step with one other are now synchronizing.'b'One reason Moscow seems out of sync with most of its neighbors is that Russia could never expect to become a part of the European Union, a prospect that provided a powerful incentive for change in nations like the Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland. These countries were escaping Russia and joining Europe. Russia could not escape itself.'b'But there is an even more important difference, something the Romanian-born philosopher Emil Cioran called Russia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chistorical belatedness.\xe2\x80\x9d For decades Russia could sustain long periods of inaction on pressing issues, mostly out of fear. The czars postponed the abolition of serfdom for decades because they feared that the move would upset the delicate status quo between nobility and peasantry. Reform, when it finally came, was executed gradually and didn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed in producing enough independent and economically stable property owners who would be immune to revolutionary calls for land redistribution. Czarist attempts to maintain the status quo led to the country\xe2\x80\x99s explosion.'b'A similarly pressing issue today is reform of the Russian judicial and law-enforcement systems \xe2\x80\x94 something the Kremlin has indefinitely postponed. A dependent judiciary and police force inherited from the Soviets and never meant to protect civil and property rights is a reliable tool to keep political control. But the absence of a rule-based environment has prevented Russia from developing enough independent and economically viable property owners with a stake in maintaining the status quo. In an isolated, economically reeling nation, people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a stake in the system will turn against it. Once again, attempts to maintain the status quo may lead to an explosion.'b'Political time in Russia seems to drag on for ages. Our New Year celebrations will not be a mark of coming change. They will simply remind us of the reality that Russia is, once more, dangerously behind the times. As with many previous regimes, our current leaders have died a moral death long before their days in power end. When they leave, the next generation of Russian leaders will once again have to play catch-up.'b''b'\n'b'Maxim Trudolyubov 'b'is the opinion page editor of the business newspaper Vedomosti, a Wilson Center fellow in Washington, and the author of a forthcoming book on power and property in Russia.'b''b'PORTSMOUTH, N.H. \xe2\x80\x94 IN November, regulators from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 'b'shut down recreational and commercial cod fishing'b' in the Gulf of Maine, that enchanting arm of the coastal sea stretching east-northeast from Cape Cod. They did not have much choice: Federal law requires action to rebuild fish stocks when they are depleted, and recent surveys revealed cod populations to be at record lows, despite decades of regulations intended to restore them.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine this recent drop in the cod population as a new phenomenon \xe2\x80\x94 a result, perhaps, of global warming, or some combination of climate change and overfishing by giant steel ships armed with electronic fish-finders and precise GPS navigation systems. And it\xe2\x80\x99s just as easy to imagine that, after a season or two of belt-tightening, fish populations will rebound \xe2\x80\x94 it is, after all, a strategy that state and federal regulators have pursued for decades.'b'In fact, humans have been affecting the Atlantic\xe2\x80\x99s fish stocks for centuries, beginning with technology so simple that people today would not even consider it \xe2\x80\x9ctechnology.\xe2\x80\x9d Forgetting that history, we opt for short-term fixes, which only compound the problem.'b'The fishery resources of the western Atlantic once seemed virtually limitless, with fish supposedly as numerous as grains of sand in the Sahara. And yet the current emergency effort to restore cod populations is simply the latest chapter in a 150-year saga in which fishermen, scientists, industrialists and politicians have consistently confronted emptier nets and fewer fish.'b'As early as the 1850s, fishermen from Maine and Massachusetts began to pester their governments to do something about declining cod catches. Those men fished with hooks and lines from small wooden sailboats and rowboats. Fearing \xe2\x80\x9cthe material injury of the codfishing interests of this state\xe2\x80\x9d by increased fishing for menhaden, a critical forage fish for cod, fishermen from Gouldsboro, Me., implored the Legislature in 1857 to limit menhaden hauls.'b'Yet annual cod landings in the Gulf of Maine continued to slide, from about 70,000 metric tons in 1861 to about 54,000 metric tons in 1880, to about 20,000 tons in the 1920s, to just a few thousand metric tons in recent years. There have been a few upticks along the way, such as one bumper year in the mid-1980s when the cod catch reached 25,000 tons (due, in part, to an unnecessarily large expansion of the fishing fleet), but for the most part the trend has been noticeably downward since the era of the Civil War. There have been plenty of warnings along the way. Maine\xe2\x80\x99s fishery commissioner, Edwin W. Gould, spoke out plainly in 1892. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the same old story,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe buffalo is gone; the whale is disappearing; the seal fishery is threatened with destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d For Mr. Gould, the path forward was clear: \xe2\x80\x9cFish need protection.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In July 1914, after more than 40 years of reports on declining fishery resources by the United States Fish Commission and state fish commissions, The New York Times ran an article forecasting disaster. \xe2\x80\x9cExtermination Threatens American Sea Fishes \xe2\x80\x94 Cost to Consumer Has Risen between 10 and 600 Per Cent Because of Decrease in Supply.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But that was right before a technological revolution in the fisheries. Sails and oars and hooks and lines were about to be replaced by steam and diesel engines, and massive nets dragged along the bottom that snared every fish in their path. Decades of well-founded concerns about depletion were overwhelmed by an avalanche of cheap fish. The new generation of draggers could fish faster, harder and deeper for the few fish that remained. Fishermen breathed a sigh of relief.'b'Twentieth-century cod populations, ravaged by draggers\xe2\x80\x99 efficiency, declined further. In 1954 a fisheries economist from Boston charged fishing interests with continuing \xe2\x80\x9cto exploit recklessly the limited self-renewing stocks of these species.\xe2\x80\x9d That was just before the first factory-equipped freezer-trawler arrived at the prime fishing waters around the Grand Banks off Newfoundland from Europe. The size of an ocean liner, it could scoop up everything in its wake. Those ships made the steam-powered draggers from 1914 look positively quaint. And they caught lots of fish.'b'Overfishing has been the norm for a very long time, but the market has masked the mess in two fundamental ways. At every step fishermen confronting declining catches developed gear that fished more intensively, taking a larger percentage of the fewer fish that remained. Such a strategy was clearly not sustainable. Meanwhile, fishermen continued to earn enough to make fishing worthwhile, even if many encouraged their sons to pursue other careers because there would be little future in fishing. The Gulf of Maine cod stocks today are probably only a fraction of 1 percent of what they were during George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s presidency.'b'If there is any lesson in this story of large-scale, long-term environmental degradation, it is not that fishermen were (or are) to blame, or that scientists were (or are) to blame, or that politicians were (or are) to blame. The system was (and is) to blame. Our system of exploiting nature\xe2\x80\x99s resources, with its checks and balances, its desire for prosperity and security, its willingness to honor a multiplicity of voices, and its changing sense of \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d is insufficiently nimble to stop the desecration of commonly held resources on which the long-term good of everyone depends.'b'The recent ban on cod fishing in the Gulf of Maine was an important step toward restoration, though clearly marine systems are very complex and subject to many variables. Considering that ban in light of history, however, is crucial. Historical perspectives provide a vital sense of scale for the sobering restoration challenges we face.'b'The fisheries story, however, also provides a heading into the future, revealing as it does the tragic consequences of decision makers\xe2\x80\x99 unwillingness to steer a precautionary course in the face of environmental uncertainties. At every step of the way, decisions could have been made to exploit fish stocks more sustainably. That\xe2\x80\x99s a tale worth pondering.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 OVER the last decade, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s approval ratings have gone from bad to worse to outright terrible, dropping from about 40 percent at the end of 2004 to a meager 15 percent today, 'b'according to Gallup'b'. The American people are frustrated with the gridlock and hyperpartisan atmosphere in Washington, but a large part of the problem is the perception that lawmakers believe the rules don\xe2\x80\x99t apply to them.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just a matter of perception: Since 2008, the number of disciplinary actions taken by the House Ethics Committee against members of Congress has quadrupled.'b'Senators and congressmen have a responsibility not only to lead by example, but also to clean up the abuses of power that contribute to the public\xe2\x80\x99s plummeting confidence in Congress. Among other reforms, there\xe2\x80\x99s one simple, common-sense change that the House can pass right now to prevent future violations and help restore the public\xe2\x80\x99s trust in Congress: require all members to take annual ethics training.'b'The Senate has already taken this step. The 2007 Honest Leadership and Open Government Act \xe2\x80\x94 passed in response to the convictions of several former representatives and lobbyists, including Jack Abramoff \xe2\x80\x94 required senators and their staffs to take \xe2\x80\x9congoing\xe2\x80\x9d ethics training. But the bill remained silent when it came to ethics training for members of the House (other, existing rules require our staffs to participate in annual training).'b'The 2007 act also introduced a long list of rules changes intended to rein in corruption; the problem is, more than half of the 435 House members were sworn in before those rules changed in 2007, and nothing in the law requires them to know the new rules.'b'To close this loophole, we have introduced the Ensuring Trust and Honorability in Congressional Standards (Ethics) Act, which would make continuing ethics training mandatory for all lawmakers. The Washington Post has called this bill the \xe2\x80\x9cNo Member Can Reasonably Vote Against This Act\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 though, amazingly, some of our colleagues just might. They contend that a training session would do little to curtail the sort of grand abuses of power that have marred Congress in recent years. But according to a representative from Public Citizen, a nonpartisan public-interest group, many of the ethical infractions we have seen stem not from intentional corruption but rather ignorance or misunderstanding of the rules.'b'Ethics rules can be complex and evolve over time, and there are a lot of them: As the 'b'House Ethics Committee website'b' notes, \xe2\x80\x9cEthics rules and regulations have grown substantially since the 1960s.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, new technology, like social media, and changing campaign finance laws make it difficult for members to figure out where the ethical line is. Members who use social media are often confused about what type of information they can share on their official website and what information they should share on their campaign site.'b'The idea that House members are exempt from receiving continuing education about the ethics rules they are expected to follow makes no sense. Why is it such an imposition for members to take one hour out of the year to familiarize themselves with the ethics rules?'b'When the House reconvenes in a few days, one of its first steps will be to adopt new rules for the 114th Congress. Aside from our bill, we urge our colleagues to include mandatory training in those rules. We have a chance to close the loophole in the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, strengthen ethics rules and take a step toward restoring the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in Congress. We hope our colleagues will seize it.'b'ESTES PARK, Colo. \xe2\x80\x94 On the first day of the new year, as on the last day of the old year, I slip outside at dusk and try to run away from my problems. There is no better way to make sense of the daily clutter of inchoate thoughts than bouncing along a trail, immortality in every stride.'b'Of course, everything hurts \xe2\x80\x94 joints, calf muscles, a toe that refuses to warm. When someone with more spring to the step passes by, I feel a pang of loss: 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll never be that fast again. 'b'And then, loathing at having that thought. It\xe2\x80\x99s a bad day when the most creative thing you do is come up with an unoriginal form of self-pity.'b'It helps to have smarter people musing on the same subject. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no escaping the tragedy of life, which is that we are all aging from the day we are born.\xe2\x80\x9d So writes Atul Gawande, surgeon, author and courier of common sense, in his book \xe2\x80\x9cBeing Mortal.\xe2\x80\x9d He goes on to show that the real tragedy is not every click of the postpartum clock, but how we have come to see aging as a disease.'b'I came to Dr. Gawande\xe2\x80\x99s book after meeting a most remarkable man in this alpine town set against the overly ambitious geology of Rocky Mountain National Park \xe2\x80\x94 Tom Hornbein. He\xe2\x80\x99s also a doctor, elfin and energetic, bearded and balding, who will defy gravity on many a day by clipping himself into a climber\xe2\x80\x99s bolt on a vertical flank of said Rocky Mountains. He\xe2\x80\x99s 84.'b'Climbers know Dr. Hornbein for his historic accomplishment in 1963: ascending the West Ridge of Mount Everest, with Willi Unsoeld, and surviving a night at 28,000 feet without tent or sleeping bag. If not the most extraordinary achievement in mountaineering, it is very high on the all-time list. \xe2\x80\x9cThe night was overpoweringly empty,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cMostly there was nothing. We hung suspended in a timeless void.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He got lucky, as there was no jet stream wind on that night. But luck, as they say, is the residue of design, and Tom Hornbein is nothing if not methodical. His book, \xe2\x80\x9cEverest: The West Ridge,\xe2\x80\x9d is widely recognized as a classic. It\xe2\x80\x99s aging well, in part, because so many contemporary books on mountain climbing are all about score settling and product placement.'b'I was whining, in as diplomatic a way as possible, about reaching an age when the high summits no longer have quite the pull they did for me, when a beer and a brat on the 40-yard line can be just as enticing as looking down at cloud cover from Mount Rainier\xe2\x80\x99s apex. After listening to Hornbein describe a routine that includes regular rock climbing with Jon Krakauer, another Colorado author and mountaineer, I asked him about his secret to aging.'b'It may be true, as George Orwell said, that \xe2\x80\x9cat 50, everyone has the face he deserves.\xe2\x80\x9d Orwell died at 46, so his observation was purely speculative. But what about the body we deserve? Hornbein clearly takes care of his, though he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make any of the annoying claims of the aging-well proselytizer.'b'He said he experienced very little physical loss in his 50s and 60s. In his 70s, body parts started to creak and pop, and he noticed gradual decline with every year. In his 80s, he\xe2\x80\x99s slower, much more cautious, and cognizant of his limitations. The will is there, if not always the way. But he shows up, proof again of the adage about success.'b'During a recent warm weather spell, \xe2\x80\x9cI got out with a young friend to do some bolt-clipping sport route he\xe2\x80\x99d prepared for me to lead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot difficult, but quite enough.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hornbein brought up Gawande\xe2\x80\x99s book. He laughed at himself, noting that he was at an age when death is a regular topic of conversation. Hornbein goes to a lot of funerals. Friends, including some who touched the roof of the world, are dead or dying. He said all of this with a twinkle in his eye. Or at least it seemed that way to me.'b'Gawande makes the point that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get over the idea that aging is a disease. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople live longer and better than any time in history,\xe2\x80\x9d Gawande writes. \xe2\x80\x9cBut scientific advances have turned the process of aging and dying into medical experiences.\xe2\x80\x9d And he concludes, \xe2\x80\x9cDeath of course is not failure. Death is normal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Keeping normal at a safe distance, however, requires some deliberation and some risk-taking \xe2\x80\x94 both in moderation. The mountaineers who made history a half-century ago, and are alive today, like to cite this admonition: There are old climbers, and bold climbers, but no old, bold climbers.'b'Hornbein is too modest to add a coda. There may come a time, not so long from now, when the steps to his front porch will seem like Everest. But listening to him talk about plans for the coming days, in and out of the mountains, I drew one conclusion. He stays in motion, whether going up, down or sideways.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'As one of Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clonely progressives\xe2\x80\x9d ('b'Op-Ed'b', Dec. 27), I would like to expand on Mary Pipher\xe2\x80\x99s observations.'b'Despite being a very red state, Nebraska has some pretty progressive traits.

Under the radar, tensions have also been brewing over compliance with a number of arms control treaties that for decades have been vital to keeping the peace between the two nuclear powers and setting an example for other countries.'b'Washington accuses Moscow of violating at least five of these agreements. A failure to resolve the impasse could have extremely dangerous consequences for the post-Cold War order, since even 20 years after the fall of the Soviet Union, the two sides together possess more than 'b'10,000'b' nuclear weapons, more than 90 percent of what exists in the world.'b'The most serious dispute centers on the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty, which bans both sides from deploying ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with a range of between 300 and 3,400 miles that carry nuclear or conventional warheads. These were among the weapons America once stationed in Europe to demonstrate a commitment to its allies and deter the Soviets from aggression.'b'Under the treaty, signed by President Ronald Reagan and the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, America destroyed 'b'846 missiles'b' and the Soviets, 1,846 missiles. Both sides had come to see the systems as unacceptably risky to their own forces since they would only have 10 to 15 minutes warning of an attack compared to twice that in attacks involving long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles. Mr. Gorbachev also was desperate to cut military spending.'b'Although the pact also prohibited the production and flight testing of new I.N.F. systems, Russia, flush with oil money and pushing a more aggressive foreign policy, began testing a new cruise missile as early as 2008. The Obama administration raised the matter with the Russians in May 2013, and in July 2014 it formally alleged that the test violated the treaty. The Russians have refused to even acknowledge conducting a missile test or to discuss potential solutions. Instead, they have accused the United States of noncompliance, which the administration denies.'b'A resolution is complicated by continued hostility over President Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s invasion of Ukraine and concerns that Mr. Putin, determined to reconstitute the Soviet Union, may be eager to face down the West. For some time, Russia has seen NATO\xe2\x80\x99s presence on its borders as a threat. Meanwhile, the Americans say Russia has failed to comply fully with at least four other treaties, including those requiring the destruction of biological and chemical arms.'b'There are other factors at work, too. Russia resents the fact that China, India and Pakistan are building their missile arsenals without treaty constraints and has attached greater importance to its nuclear forces as its conventional forces have deteriorated.'b'Despite the dispute, it would be a huge mistake for the United States to withdraw from the I.N.F. treaty, as some congressmen have demanded. That would remove all restraints on Russia and seriously weaken a system of treaties that has been remarkably effective over decades at curbing the spread of destructive weapons.'b'It would also be a mistake for either side to reintroduce the banned weapons onto their own territory or elsewhere. Russia\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister, 'b'Sergey Lavrov'b', recently asserted Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s right to put nuclear missiles in Crimea, while Brian McKeon, a senior Pentagon official, told Congress this month that one response to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s treaty violation could be to deploy American ground missiles in Europe. New deployments would reverse a trend in which the two countries have substantially reduced their huge arsenals in recent years.'b'The Obama administration should continue pursuing a diplomatic solution to the treaty dispute and resist the growing pressure in Congress for quick retaliation, which could make the situation worse. And it should explore other forms of pressure, like economic punishment and deployment of new defenses against cruise missiles.'b'So far, there is no evidence that Russia has deployed its new missiles, which would be a serious escalation. The United States and its allies should make efforts to bring Russia back into compliance with the treaty, and Russia needs to know that defiance will come at a cost.'b'The Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s decision in December 'b'to join a class-action suit against New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Correction Department'b' has prepared the way for reforms proposed by Mayor Bill de Blasio to root out corruption and brutality at the notorious Rikers Island jail complex. Success depends heavily on the cooperation of Norman Seabrook, the president of the politically powerful correction officers\xe2\x80\x99 union and a longtime supporter of the disastrous status quo.'b'Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, says that he and Mr. Seabrook have come to an agreement on needed reforms. But the union leader\xe2\x80\x99s record of bullying, his attempts to undermine Mr. Ponte\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors, and his history of shielding abusive officers from justice suggests that he will not be a willing partner in remaking what the Justice Department has described as a \xe2\x80\x9cdeep-seated culture of violence\xe2\x80\x9d in the jail system. Which means this: Federal oversight could well be needed to complete the job.'b'Mr. Seabrook\xe2\x80\x99s shameful record was set forth in detail in 'b'a recent report in The Times by Michael Schwirtz and Michael Winerip'b'. Among the many examples of his stewardship was his vigorous campaign to undermine Florence Finkle, the correction department\xe2\x80\x99s chief investigator who resigned in August after she tried to replace a policy of handling brutality cases internally with a tougher system that would have exposed offending officers to criminal prosecution by the district attorney. Mr. Seabrook helped to scuttle some of Ms. Finkle\xe2\x80\x99s investigations and arranged for the transfer one of her top deputies.'b'In a particularly brazen move in November 2013 apparently aimed at preventing an inmate from testifying against two officers, Mr. Seabrook shut down the bus service that ferried inmates back and forth to the courts, causing hundreds of them to miss their court dates. When Ms. Finkle left the office, the de Blasio administration replaced her with a former Police Department official \xe2\x80\x94 and childhood friend of Mr. Seabrook\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 who had no prosecutorial experience.'b'Criminal prosecutions of correction officers are rare, but Mr. Seabrook apparently would prefer none at all. Thanks to his lobbying efforts, the State Legislature in 2014 approved a bill that would move jurisdiction for Rikers criminal cases from the office of the Bronx district attorney, whom, Mr. Seabrook dislikes, to the district attorney in Queens, where he thinks the officers will be treated more fairly. Gov. Andrew Cuomo, describing it as unconstitutional, rightly vetoed the bill, which would have prevented Bronx County from prosecuting offenses within its borders.'b'Mr. Seabrook was able to amass and wield enormous power because city officials viewed the jail system as a low priority during most of his two decades as union president. That began to change last summer when 'b'The Times published a grisly account'b' of 129 inmates who had been seriously injured in incidents with officers during an 11-month period in 2013. Less than a month later, a much anticipated investigation by the Justice Department revealed a harrowing story in which adolescents were sadistically beaten by officers as a matter of routine. The United States attorney in Manhattan has gone to court to make sure the city ends these abusive practices.'b'Mr. Seabrook is intimately linked to these practices. For that reason alone, federal officials now investigating the jail system should not hesitate to take over direct supervision if the reform effort flags and the city is not up to the job.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not a tourist attraction yet, but when hard-hatted construction workers journey down from the summit of 432 Park Avenue at 57th Street they proudly rattle off-sky-high statistics \xe2\x80\x94 1,396 feet and 96 stories tall \xe2\x80\x94 that now make the luxury condominium tower in Midtown the tallest habitable building in the city.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s already an eye-popping distraction for miles out into the suburbs and surrounding countryside as it soars up, way up, from Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s signature skyline.'b'Get used to the rise of what are called pencil towers. There will be more, with a dozen or so planned in the next several years in mid-Manhattan, as the city\xe2\x80\x99s silhouette yields to a new era of Slim Jim buildings with small footprints that build straight up, not out, as 432 Park does from a base of only 93 feet by 93 feet.'b'The tower is already a fascinating cynosure for considered condemnation or approval by groundlings for daring to rise up like ... what? Gotham\xe2\x80\x99s fickle finger of real estate wealth signaling the next Gilded Age? A giant upraised baton cuing us all to a symphony of conspicuous consumption, topped by a $95-million penthouse nestled amid the clouds?'b'Right now, the building, which is scheduled to open in 2015, suggests a lonesome denuded redwood yearning for mates as it dominates what\xe2\x80\x99s become a lower field of retro shrubbery \xe2\x80\x94 the older, shorter office buildings and luxury jewelry and designer shops that line the streets around it.'b'Superlatives are the only rule in New York. The pencil tower at 432 Park stands 28-feet taller than the new One World Trade Center downtown when you discount that building\xe2\x80\x99s spire, the element that allows it to secure its post-9/11 claim of 1,776 feet. The Empire State Building isn\xe2\x80\x99t even close, sweet as it rests down there on 34th Street. The new tower is so tall it had to get construction clearance from air control regulators at the Federal Aviation Administration; other new pencil towers may need clearance, too.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI see it from my seat at Giants stadium, from my house in Jersey, from everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d said a construction worker on his coffee break, scrolling through his favorite workplace photos on his phone to show the view from the tower down upon the city when the tops of smaller skyscrapers poke up from the clouds below like headstones in a snow covered cemetery.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis changes everything,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to feel I was in the middle class, but this thing stretches all that.\xe2\x80\x9d He was referring to the prices of the units in the tower. Its 104 condos are reported to be selling well, at a minimum of $7 million and up, way up.'b'METULA, Israel \xe2\x80\x94 If I were a political novelist, I\xe2\x80\x99d try to write a novel about Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of Israel.'b'The story would be partly Nixonian. Netanyahu is surpassingly brilliant, as even his opponents here concede. He knows the minute guts of Israeli politics and has read deeply into big history and grand strategy. He is also said to be suspicious, solitary and insular. It is hard to stay on good terms with him, whether you are on his staff, or his nation\xe2\x80\x99s closest ally.'b'The story would be partly Kennedyesque. The Netanyahu clan was presided over by Benjamin\xe2\x80\x99s brilliant father Benzion, the great medieval historian. The eldest brother Jonathan was the golden child. When Jonathan died in the raid on Entebbe in 1976, hopes shifted to Benjamin, who is known as Bibi. Political analysts have spent decades psychoanalyzing the family dynamic, with mixed results, but a novelist who studied Sophocles or Tolstoy might be able to make some sense of it.'b'The story would be partly Churchillian. Netanyahu sees himself in world historical terms, and admires Theodor Herzl and Winston Churchill \xe2\x80\x94 two men who saw dangers ahead of other people. Netanyahu obviously lacks many of Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s qualities, like playful charm, but he has a profound nationalist passion and a consuming historical consciousness.'b'Like Churchill, he is wisest when things are going wrong. He has been a pessimist about the Arab world. As the Arab Spring has deteriorated, as Palestinian democracy led to Hamas, as run of the mill extremists have lost ground to the Islamic State, Bibi\xe2\x80\x99s instincts have basically been proved correct.'b'The story would be part Shakespearean. Nearly every political leader has one close friend or spouse, often female, who is widely hated. People can\xe2\x80\x99t blame the leader for slights, so they blame her. In Israel, the role is played by Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Sara, who has been the subject of fascination and scorn for decades: She is often described as Lady Macbeth. Few know her exact role, but, it is said, she exiles the disloyal, shapes his politics, mistreats servants and distracts him when he is supposed to be running the country. Obviously, any novel about Netanyahu and modern Israel would have to be told from her vantage point. The narrative voice would be electric.'b'The story would be part \xe2\x80\x9cCitizen Kane.\xe2\x80\x9d Netanyahu rose to fame via CNN. His rise and survival are intertwined with changes in media, with the decline of old newspapers that are generally hostile, and the rise of new cable networks and outlets that are often his allies. Ferociously tending his image, his wars with his foes in the Israeli press have been epic.'b'Finally, the story would be part Machiavelli. The great Renaissance philosopher argued that it is best to be both loved and feared, but if you have to choose one, it is better to be feared. Netanyahu is not loved, especially by those in his party. But he is feared and acknowledged, the way any large, effective object is feared and respected.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m visiting Israel for the 18th or 19th time (my son is currently a member of the Lone Soldiers Program, which allows people from around the world to serve in the Israeli military). I asked a couple of smart Israelis what their coming elections are about. They said that the elections are about one thing: What do you think of Netanyahu? Such is the outsized role he plays in the consciousness of this nation.'b'No one has a simple view of him. To some, he is a monster who has expanded the settlements on the West Bank, which are a moral stain and do calamitous damage to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to win support around the world. To some, he is the necessary man in hard times, the vigilant guardian as the rest of the Middle East goes berserk.'b'Both viewpoints have some truth. To me, his caution is most fascinating. For all his soaring rhetoric and bellicosity, he has been a defensive leader. He seems to understand that, in his country\xe2\x80\x99s situation, the lows are lower than the highs are high. The costs of a mistake are bigger than the benefits of an accomplishment. So he is loath to take risks. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do some smart things, like improve life for Palestinians on the West Bank, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do unpredictable dumb things, like prematurely bomb Iran. He talks everything through, and his decisions shift and flip as the discussions evolve.'b'If you think trends in the Middle East will doom Israel unless it acts, then this defensiveness is a disaster. If you think, as I do, that Israel has to wait out the current spasm of Islamist radicalism, then this caution has its uses.'b'Israeli voters haven\xe2\x80\x99t warmed to Netanyahu over the past quarter-century. But they have come to think more like him, accepting that this conflict will endure, digging in for a dogged struggle. For good and ill, he has refashioned the national mind.'b'In 2014, soaring inequality in advanced nations finally received the attention it deserved, as Thomas Piketty\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Capital in the Twenty-First Century'b'\xe2\x80\x9d became a surprise (and deserving) best seller. The usual suspects are still in well-paid denial, but, to everyone else, it is now obvious that income and wealth are more concentrated at the very top than they have been since the Gilded Age \xe2\x80\x94 and the trend shows no sign of letting up.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s a story about developments within nations, and, therefore, incomplete. You really want to supplement Piketty-style analysis with a global view, and when you do, I\xe2\x80\x99d argue, you get a better sense of the good, the bad and the potentially very ugly of the world we live in.'b'So let me suggest that you look at 'b'a remarkable chart of income gains around the world'b' produced by 'b'Branko Milanovic'b' of the City University of New York Graduate Center (which I will be joining this summer). What Mr. Milanovic shows is that income growth since the fall of the Berlin Wall has been a \xe2\x80\x9ctwin peaks\xe2\x80\x9d story. Incomes have, of course, soared at the top, as the world\xe2\x80\x99s elite becomes ever richer. But there have also been huge gains for what we might call the global middle \xe2\x80\x94 largely consisting of the rising middle classes of China and India.'b'And let\xe2\x80\x99s be clear: Income growth in emerging nations has produced huge gains in human welfare, lifting hundreds of millions of people out of desperate poverty and giving them a chance for a better life.'b'Now for the bad news: Between these twin peaks \xe2\x80\x94 the ever-richer global elite and the rising Chinese middle class \xe2\x80\x94 lies what we might call the valley of despond: Incomes have grown slowly, if at all, for people around the 20th percentile of the world income distribution. Who are these people? Basically, the advanced-country working classes. And although Mr. Milanovic\xe2\x80\x99s data only go up through 2008, we can be sure that this group has done even worse since then, wracked by the effects of high unemployment, stagnating wages, and austerity policies.'b'Furthermore, the travails of workers in rich countries are, in important ways, the flip side of the gains above and below them. Competition from emerging-economy exports has surely been a factor depressing wages in wealthier nations, although probably not the dominant force. More important, soaring incomes at the top were achieved, in large part, by squeezing those below: by cutting wages, slashing benefits, crushing unions, and diverting a rising share of national resources to financial wheeling and dealing.'b'Perhaps more important still, the wealthy exert a vastly disproportionate effect on policy. And 'b'elite priorities'b' \xe2\x80\x94 obsessive concern with budget deficits, with the supposed need to slash social programs \xe2\x80\x94 have done a lot to deepen the valley of despond.'b'So who speaks for those left behind in this twin-peaked world? You might have expected conventional parties of the left to take a populist stance on behalf of their domestic working classes. But mostly what you get instead \xe2\x80\x94 from leaders ranging from Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande of France to Ed Milliband of Britain to, yes, President Obama \xe2\x80\x94 is awkward mumbling. (Mr. Obama has, in fact, done a lot to help working Americans, but he\xe2\x80\x99s remarkably bad at making his own case.)'b'The problem with these conventional leaders, I\xe2\x80\x99d argue, is that they\xe2\x80\x99re afraid to challenge elite priorities, in particular the obsession with budget deficits, for fear of being considered irresponsible. And that leaves the field open for unconventional leaders \xe2\x80\x94 some of them seriously scary \xe2\x80\x94 who are willing to address the anger and despair of ordinary citizens.'b''b'The Greek leftists'b' who may well come to power there later this month are arguably the least scary of the bunch, although their demands for debt relief and an end to austerity may provoke a tense standoff with Brussels. Elsewhere, however, we see the rise of nationalist, anti-immigrant parties like France\xe2\x80\x99s National Front and the U.K. Independence Party, or UKIP, in Britain \xe2\x80\x94 and there are even worse people waiting in the wings.'b'All of this suggests some uncomfortable historical analogies. Remember, this is the second time we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a global financial crisis followed by a prolonged worldwide slump. Then, as now, any effective response to the crisis was blocked by elite demands for balanced budgets and stable currencies. And the eventual result was to deliver power into the hands of people who were, shall we say, not very nice.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that we\xe2\x80\x99re on the verge of fully replaying the 1930s. But I would argue that political and opinion leaders need to face up to the reality that our current global setup isn\xe2\x80\x99t working for everyone. It\xe2\x80\x99s great for the elite and has done a lot of good for emerging nations, but that valley of despond is very real. And bad things will happen if we don\xe2\x80\x99t do something about it.'b'Expect Obama to go after the Republicans in the new year.'b'In the end, after much delay and misinformation, I retrieved my new passport from the Customer Service Center near Victoria Station in London. As an unexpected bonus, it was given to me, together with its worn and now corner-clipped predecessor, inside a yellow envelope. What immediately caught my eye was that this was not a dull bureaucratic yellow \xe2\x80\x94 closer, really, to a brownish orange \xe2\x80\x94 but a shiny lemon yellow. Moreover, the paper of the envelope was agreeably smooth and uniform in texture and thin enough so that the honeycomb patterning on its reverse side just showed through. This was a gift, a blessing perhaps, entirely unintended by the smiling young woman who handed the package to me across the counter. She probably thought my look of delighted surprise had something to do with a love of travel documents rather than a long-standing obsession with the detritus of the modern world.'b'Most eager recipients of a new passport would probably have had no interest at all in the envelope, only in what it contained. Once the passport was safely stowed in a wallet or bag, the envelope would be doubtless discarded: either crumpled into a ball and thrown into the nearest receptacle or, by the environmentally correct, recycled in an appropriate bin. In either case, its fleeting purpose fulfilled, it becomes waste.'b'I had come to London that weekend for a public conversation with my brother David, an artist and writer whose book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Luminous and the Grey\xe2\x80\x9d was being launched at the Whitechapel Gallery in the east end of the city. Inspired by Wittgenstein\xe2\x80\x99s gnomic remark: \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever looks luminous does not look grey,\xe2\x80\x9d in this book David continues the sustained meditation on color that began in his earlier work \xe2\x80\x9cChromophobia.\xe2\x80\x9d A committed denizen of the city, my brother shuns the bucolic tints of ferns and buttercups in favor of the bright, chemical, industrialized hues that assail us from billboards, plastic bottles, LCD screens and fluorescent tubes.'b'David\xe2\x80\x99s latest reflections turn away from a direct contemplation of the vivid colors themselves to focus on the background conditions from which they appear. Rather than be dazzled/seduced by the glare of artificial lights, he notices how they also softly shimmer in the damp asphalt of the sidewalk beneath one\xe2\x80\x99s feet. Such moments of fugitive luminosity emerge most brilliantly from the grayscape that is the city at night. The two go hand in hand: \xe2\x80\x9cThey cohabit and sustain one another,\xe2\x80\x9d he remarks, \xe2\x80\x9cin an unacknowledged relationship of interdependence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The practice of such art is honed by learning to notice what is around us all the time but habitually overlooked. This discipline of attention is every bit as rigorous as that of the solitary contemplative who strives to turn her mind away from the prompts of compulsive and repetitive reactions in order to glimpse the world afresh and see it as though for the first time. By presenting experience as more or less constant and predictable, our perceptual habits can be consoling. Each morning the sight of the same undulating meadows from the train window, the same city streets on the way to work reassure and comfort us. But the meadows and streets are not the same. They have changed in unremarkable but discernible ways. The light that falls on them today is not the light that fell on them yesterday. Just take a photo of the same view every day at exactly the same time and you will see that no two pictures are ever alike. For, unlike the brain, the camera doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie.'b'Mental habits not only impose a veneer of sameness on the ever-shifting detail of the present. In doing so, they dull our senses, blinding us to the perplexing uniqueness of each moment. And they flatten our emotions, too, leaving us listless and bored, hankering after the intense bursts of stimulation promised in those brightly colored ads.'b'So just as a meditator mindfully attends to the passage of breath across the upper lip \xe2\x80\x94 cooler as it comes in, warmer as it goes out \xe2\x80\x94 the artist focuses attention on those details of the world that are likewise forgotten, taken for granted or ignored. The aim of these practices is not to acquire esoteric knowledge about the subtleties of breathing or the peculiar qualities of neon light reflected in a puddle. One trains oneself to see the world anew, no longer wholly determined by the biological, social and cultural habits we have acquired as human animals. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the doors of perception were cleansed,\xe2\x80\x9d noted another London artist, William Blake, \xe2\x80\x9ceverything would appear to man as it is, Infinite.\xe2\x80\x9d The poet is not advocating a proto-psychedelic mysticism here. Blake\xe2\x80\x99s vision is a tragic one. \xe2\x80\x9cFor man has closed himself up,\xe2\x80\x9d he concludes, \xe2\x80\x9ctill he sees all things thro\xe2\x80\x99 narrow chinks of his cavern.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Scraps of discarded paper, plastic and cloth are as transient and contingent as the distended patch of sodium light on the hood of a parked car. Like reflected light, they bear the imprint of the world that produces and sustains them.'b'On my first (of three) visits to Her Majesty\xe2\x80\x99s Passport Office, I had spotted a piece of white paper at the side of Bridge Place, lodged between the tarmac and the kerb. I snatched it up. One corner had already been torn off. Someone had scrawled on it a large letter \xe2\x80\x9cE\xe2\x80\x9d with a thick black marker pen (though had this been Guangzhou, I would have held it at another angle and seen the Chinese character for \xe2\x80\x9cmountain\xe2\x80\x9d). The rest of the paper was stippled, soiled, and, in a couple of places, perforated by tiny holes: the typical inscriptions of passing shoes and tires. Its world was written into this distressed sheet of paper, just as the prints of official fingers were invisibly traced on the surface of the yellow envelope in which the passport was finally delivered.'b'You have to be quick. If such found objects are not immediately retrieved, they will soon be swept away, gathered up, crushed and destroyed. I keep them in a zip-lock plastic folder in order to preserve them just as they were found. At this stage I strive to keep myself and my actions as much out of the process as possible. On returning home, these things become the raw material of my art. They will be glued to card, cut and recut with scalpels into squares and rectangles, then organized alongside other scraps in a formal mosaic generated by simple algorithms. This is an attempt to redeem the world by harvesting and transforming its rubbish into objects of contemplation that might even pass for beauty. \xe2\x80\x9cFor even the fairest cosmos,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Heraclitus in the 6th century B.C., \xe2\x80\x9cis but a pile of sweepings heaped at random.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\n'b'Stephen Batchelor 'b' is the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cConfession of a Buddhist Atheist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'BANGALORE, India \xe2\x80\x94 When I met Watareka Vijitha Thero in early 2014 in a suburb of Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, he had been in hiding for nearly five months. The gentle-voiced monk had spoken out against anti-Muslim fearmongering by a hard-line group called the Buddhist Power Force, known by its Sinhalese initials B.B.S.'b'Mr. Vijitha\xe2\x80\x99s car was attacked in retaliation, and he narrowly escaped. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean for Buddhism if those that speak for communal harmony have to hide in fear?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does it mean for my country that the government lets these lawless thugs have a free run?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Six months later, Mr. Vijitha was found on a road near Colombo stripped naked and bloody, his hands and legs bound. The B.B.S. denied involvement. When the monk filed a complaint, the police threw him in jail for 12 days on charges of self-inflicted violence \xe2\x80\x94 a warning to others who dared to criticize hard-line Buddhists.'b'Three years ago, the B.B.S and other hard-line groups were fringe elements. Today, they are a powerful force, and their aggressive assertion of Sinhalese Buddhist dominance, in a country that is 70 percent Buddhist, is increasingly mirrored in government-approved revisionist histories of 'b'Sri Lanka'b'.'b'Now, with the country\xe2\x80\x99s president, 'b'Mahinda Rajapaksa'b', facing a challenger in elections on Thursday, hard-line Buddhist groups have mobilized to support him. A wave of populist chauvinism has engulfed the country and sidelined the Tamil and Muslim minorities that make up over a quarter of the population. If it continues unchecked, Sri Lanka will face more instability, ethnic polarization and suppression of dissent.'b'Extremist Buddhist monks are confounding; they directly contradict a canonically nonviolent religion often perceived as apolitical. Like radical monks in Thailand and 'b'Myanmar'b', Sri Lankan hard-liners reserve special ire for Muslims. The B.B.S. and its counterparts have incited mobs to demolish mosques. A June speech by the B.B.S. chief Galagodaththe Gnanasara triggered 'b'anti-Muslim rioting'b' in Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s southern villages; thugs burned homes, four people were killed and at least 80 were injured. But instead of arresting Mr. Gnanasara, the president simply urged \xe2\x80\x9call parties concerned to act in restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Sri Lanka, monks have long been involved in efforts to bolster Buddhist primacy. In the 19th century, amid fears that European colonizers and Christian missionaries were diluting Sri Lankan identity, monks led a Buddhist revival, followed by a cultural movement for the dominance of the Sinhalese language over English. These efforts produced a Buddhist nationalism that persisted after independence in 1948 (Buddhism itself is accorded primacy in the Sri Lankan Constitution).'b'In the last decade, activism by Buddhist monks has grown more overtly political. In 2004, they founded the National Heritage Party, known by the initials J.H.U., and contested elections for the first time; nine monks won parliamentary seats. Though it never espoused violence, the J.H.U. supported the Sri Lanka Freedom Party of Mr. Rajapaksa. As the government intensified its battle against the separatist Tamil Tigers, the monks\xe2\x80\x99 backing gave religious legitimacy to the state\xe2\x80\x99s claim of protecting the island for the Sinhalese Buddhist majority.'b'The defeat of the Tamil rebels in 2009 ended the country\xe2\x80\x99s nearly 30-year-long civil war. The B.B.S. emerged during this postwar high, deploying a selective reading of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s origins \xe2\x80\x94 excluding the contributions of indigenous and non-Sinhalese communities \xe2\x80\x94 to fan fears of an existential threat to Buddhism and justify its acts of violence.'b'At a rally in 2012, the B.B.S. leader Mr. Gnanasara likened the Sri Lankan military\xe2\x80\x99s victory to the ancient conquest of a Tamil chief by a beloved Sinhalese king. The spectators knew the story and cheered at the comparison. \xe2\x80\x9cTamils have been taught a lesson twice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; so would other minorities if they tried to \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge Sri Lankan culture.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the past two years, hard-line groups have consolidated their political power. The B.B.S. has even used the state-owned cellular network to raise funds. Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s defense secretary, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the president\xe2\x80\x99s brother, has attended some of their events. The government, meanwhile, denies any links to them.'b'By instruction or apathy, the police and army look away when hard-line monks incite riots, and fail to thoroughly investigate complaints. While the B.B.S. is not the sole voice of Sri Lankan Buddhists, its recourse to violence has increasingly forced secular liberals and pacifist Buddhists into silence.'b'More perniciously, a nostalgia for Buddhist supremacy is now widespread. Today, a revisionist version of history is celebrated in films, books, TV programs and state-run newspapers. In the Tamil-dominated north, and in the east, where most of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims live, national monuments have been erected to honor Buddhist kings. Government offices frequently announce \xe2\x80\x9crediscoveries\xe2\x80\x9d of long-lost Buddhist temples and Buddha statues are placed in areas sacred to Muslims or Tamils. In the Kanniya hot springs in the east, a sign in Sinhalese and English explains that the site \xe2\x80\x94 considered among Tamils to be linked to a Hindu myth\xe2\x80\x94 had been part of an ancient Buddhist monastery. In Kuragala in the central hills, the culture ministry built a Buddhist stupa at a Sufi Muslim cave, declaring it an ancient monastery site. These claims aren\xe2\x80\x99t based on new archeological findings; the Sri Lankan government is simply rewriting history with a more politically expedient narrative.'b'In November, Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s health minister, Maithripala Sirisena, 'b'unexpectedly defected'b' and announced his candidacy for president. The B.B.S. denounced him as a Western stooge and gave its support to Mr. Rajapaksa, but the J.H.U. has said it will oppose Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s undemocratic ways by backing his opponent.'b'Mr. Sirisena is likely aware that he must play up his Buddhist allegiances if he hopes to defeat Mr. Rajapaksa \xe2\x80\x94 a strategy that will only strengthen chauvinist groups. He has sworn to preserve Buddhism\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional prominence, and rejected Tamil demands for greater autonomy. With little choice, Tamil and Muslim parties now back Mr. Sirisena.'b'No matter who wins in January, the message is unmistakable: To be truly considered Sri Lankan these days, one must accept the primacy and glory of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Sinhalese Buddhist past. Unless it is challenged, this mindset will pose a far greater danger to Sri Lanka than the blows of hard-line thugs.'b''b' 'b'Rohini Mohan 'b' is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Seasons of Trouble: Life Amid the Ruins of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s Civil War.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'IN American politics, personality is, supposedly, destiny: Having a conservative personality makes us conservative on economic and social policy, and vice versa for liberals. Think of the stereotypes: the free-spending, libertine liberal; the rock-ribbed, free-market conservative.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing natural about this pairing between personality and such broad ideologies. Instead, the structure of our ideological divide is shaped by political messaging rather than psychological differences. In fact, 'b'our research'b', which we recently published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, suggests that the personality characteristics that make someone culturally conservative will often tend to promote left-wing economic views, favoring redistributive economic intervention by the government. How is this possible?'b'Start by considering the most influential scholarly view of how personality affects political ideology: the \xe2\x80\x9crigidity of the right\xe2\x80\x9d model. It holds that people differ from one another in terms of whether they are closed-minded and prefer what is familiar, or are open-minded and prefer diverse experiences.'b'According to this view, those with a conservative personality \xe2\x80\x94 which is thought to be implemented by basic neurocognitive and structural brain differences \xe2\x80\x94 are likely to gravitate toward a broad-based conservative ideology, both culturally and economically. A conservative personality, the view posits, makes you favor the stability and continuity of traditional cultural norms, and it makes you favor right-wing economic policy because that sort of policy will not disrupt the prevailing economic hierarchy.'b'Though very influential, the rigidity of the right model has incurred 'b'charges of ideological bias'b' within the scholarly community. But we think that there is something more fundamentally wrong with it: Most of the core disagreements between the left and right concern economic matters, and there are often decisive forces compelling those with a conservative personality to be economically left wing.'b'Our research, which we published along with Christopher J. Soto of Colby College and Yphtach Lelkes of the University of Amsterdam, was the 'b'largest cross-national test'b' of how a conservative personality style actually relates to cultural and economic attitudes. Analyzing responses from over 70,000 people from 51 countries, we found that people with a conservative personality did indeed tend to adopt culturally conservative attitudes on matters like abortion, homosexuality and immigration. On this count, the rigidity of the right model seems to be valid.'b'But when it came to economic matters related to social welfare policy and economic intervention \xe2\x80\x94 the central feature of the left-right divide in much of the world \xe2\x80\x94 the results were far different. People with a conservative personality tended to lean slightly to the left.'b'According to the political scientist Christopher Johnston of Duke and his colleagues Christopher M. Federico and Howard G. Lavine of the University of Minnesota, a conservative personality might actually pull people in two directions with respect to their economic attitudes. Prioritizing order and stability will lead to a yearning for the security that left-wing economic policies aim to provide \xe2\x80\x94 but having such a conservative personality will also lead to cultural conservatism, which, if a person is politically attentive, might indirectly lead to favoring economically conservative policy as well. Why? Political messaging.'b'Political messages often promote the view that right-wing economic preferences naturally fit with right-wing cultural preferences under a broad \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d banner. These messages define what constitutes an ideologically consistent package of preferences, and make people more likely to adopt a consistent ideological bundle. They make you say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I am culturally conservative, I should also be economically conservative.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Our cross-national evidence was consistent with this argument: Over all, having a conservative personality made people lean to the left economically \xe2\x80\x94 with an important exception. Among people who were both highly attentive to politics and from countries in which left-right ideological conflict was prominent, like the United States, having a conservative personality was associated with holding right-wing economic views.'b'What does all of this mean for ideological conflict in the United States? For one thing, we must be cautious about accepting claims that a broad ideological conflict, pitting culturally traditional and free-market conservatives against culturally progressive and redistributive liberals, is a natural consequence of personality differences. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing natural about it: Such a conflict has more to do with the political messages that Americans receive about the nature of politicians\xe2\x80\x99 ideological conflict.'b'If there is nothing set about the combinations of political views we adopt, then there is nothing to say those combinations of attitudes can\xe2\x80\x99t change. Indeed, decades of research in political science have shown that the dominant packages of political attitudes often do change, as a result of messages from political elites. While such insight will not soften our hostile partisan climate, it might be helpful to keep in mind as we experience the highest levels of political polarization that the nation has seen in decades.'b'MY mother received the ransomnote on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving. It popped up on her computer screen soon after she\xe2\x80\x99d discovered that all of her files had been locked. \xe2\x80\x9cYour files are encrypted,\xe2\x80\x9d it announced. \xe2\x80\x9cTo get the key to decrypt files you have to pay 500 USD.\xe2\x80\x9d If my mother failed to pay within a week, the price would go up to $1,000. After that, her decryption key would be destroyed and any chance of accessing the 5,726 files on her PC \xe2\x80\x94 all of her data \xe2\x80\x94 would be lost forever.'b'Sincerely, CryptoWall.'b'CryptoWall 2.0 is the latest immunoresistant strain of a larger body of viruses known as ransomware. The virus is thought to infiltrate your computer when you click on a legitimate-looking attachment or through existing malware lurking on your hard drive, and once unleashed it instantly encrypts all your files, barring access to a single photo or tax receipt.'b'Everyone has the same questions when they first hear about CryptoWall:'b'Is there any other way to get rid of it besides paying the ransom? No \xe2\x80\x94 it appears to be technologically impossible for anyone to decrypt your files once CryptoWall 2.0 has locked them. (My mother had several I.T. professionals try.)'b'But should you really be handing money over to a bunch of criminals? According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, a partnership between the F.B.I. and the National White Collar Crime Center, this answer is also no. \xe2\x80\x9cRansomware messages are an attempt to extort money,\xe2\x80\x9d one public service announcement helpfully explains. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have received a ransomware message do not follow payment instructions and file a complaint.\xe2\x80\x9d Right. But that won\xe2\x80\x99t get you your files back. Which is why the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Dickson County, Tenn., recently paid a CryptoWall ransom to unlock 72,000 autopsy reports, witness statements, crime scene photographs and other documents.'b'Finally, can law enforcement at least do something to stop these attacks in the future? Probably not. Many ransomware viruses originate in Russia and other former Soviet bloc countries. The main difficulty in stopping cybercriminals isn\xe2\x80\x99t finding them, but getting foreign governments to cooperate and extradite them.'b'By the time my mom called to ask for my help, it was already Day 6 and the clock was ticking. (Literally \xe2\x80\x94 the virus comes with a countdown clock, ratcheting up the pressure to pay.) My father had already spent all week trying to convince her that losing six months of files wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the end of the world (she had last backed up her computer in May). It was pointless to argue with her. She had thought through all of her options; she wanted to pay.'b'Only, paying turned out not to be so easy; the CryptoWall hackers take only Bitcoins.'b'Picture the kind of early-adopting, hoodie-wearing member of the technocracy totally comfy with the idea of a cybercurrency neither backed nor issued by any central bank or government. Now picture the opposite of that. That is my mom. Having never so much as purchased an app in her life, my mom had no idea how to buy Bitcoins. Happily, her ransomers had anticipated this problem and included a link to a step-by-step guide, complete with pictures.'b'She\xe2\x80\x99d managed to make a cash deposit via Bank of America to the unique Bitcoin \xe2\x80\x9cwallet\xe2\x80\x9d provided by her ransomers, but since Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price is extremely volatile, her payment had already fallen $25 short by the time it arrived. (Credit and debit payments can take up to six days to process.) The fastest way to send the extra $25 was to make a direct deposit at an A.T.M. that handled Bitcoin transactions. That\xe2\x80\x99s where I came in. Coin Cafe, the Bitcoin provider my mother had chosen, had an A.T.M. in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, not too far from where I lived.'b'The Bitcoin A.T.M. was not easy to find. It was housed in the second floor hallway of a cooperative work space, tucked inside an old Nynex phone booth. On one hand, I appreciated the winking irony of this sight gag. On the other hand, Fidelity Investments this was not.'b'Inside was a little white box with no buttons, just a screen, a camera eye and a money slot. I scanned in the QR code my mom had sent me. The machine whirred to life. \xe2\x80\x9cBalance query in progress,\xe2\x80\x9d it announced. This query remained in progress for the next 20 minutes during which I left three messages on Coin Cafe\xe2\x80\x99s voice mail before abandoning the booth to get some coffee and walk around in the rain.'b'The fourth time I called, a human being answered the phone and told me the problem had been fixed. I hurried back to the A.T.M., scanned in my QR code, sent some Voldemorts $25 in crisp bills and called my mom. The whole experience had not done much to allay my misgivings about Bitcoin; what did allay them was Mike Hoats, the nice bearded man Coin Cafe sent over to fix the A.T.M.'b'We got to talking after I made my payment, and he told me that, while no one at Coin Cafe believed people should fund criminal activity by paying the ransom, their job was to broker the purchase and sale of Bitcoins, which, like cash, could be used for any purpose. CryptoWall had thrust them into the unwitting role of ransomware advisers, coping with grandmothers crying on the phone at the thought of losing all their photos or small-business owners whose family income was on the line. Coin Cafe didn\xe2\x80\x99t like profiting from the victims (according to the company, these transactions are in the low single digits as a percentage of its total business), but they were downright mortified to learn that CryptoWall had anointed them as one of their Bitcoin providers of choice, with praise for their \xe2\x80\x9cfast, simple service.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s how my mom found out about Coin Cafe \xe2\x80\x94 from her ransom note.'b'This referral is only one of the handy services CryptoWall provides to ensure a more seamless customer experience. Others include the ability to \xe2\x80\x9cdecrypt one file for free\xe2\x80\x9d and a message interface one can use \xe2\x80\x9cin case of any problems with payment or having any other questions.\xe2\x80\x9d What next, I wondered. Twenty percent off when you refer this malware to a friend? Frequent virus cards? Black Friday ransom specials?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI THINK they like the idea they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to pretend they\xe2\x80\x99re not criminals,\xe2\x80\x9d Chester Wisniewski, a senior security adviser at the computer security firm Sophos, told me when I reached him in Vancouver by phone. \xe2\x80\x9cBy using the fact that they\xe2\x80\x99re criminals to scare you, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a lot easier on them.\xe2\x80\x9d They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to hire a professional translator to get their English perfect, Mr. Wisniewski explained, or engage in any of the baroque subterfuge required of someone pretending to be a Nigerian gentleman farmer who just needs a little help claiming his inheritance.'b'In addition to being criminals, these peddlers of ransomware are clearly businesspeople, skillfully appropriating all the tools of e-commerce. From branding (CryptoWall is a variant of a fearsome earlier virus called CryptoLocker, which was shut down last year) to determining what they can extort (ransomware hackers have tested the market with prices as low as $100 and as high as $800,000, which the city of Detroit refused to pay in order to have its database decrypted), these operators are, as Mr. Wisniewski put it, part of \xe2\x80\x9ca very mature, well-oiled capitalist machine.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s also an incredibly lucrative machine: Some experts estimate that CryptoLocker hackers cleared around $30 million in 100 days in 2013. And more than a million PCs worldwide have been hit with the CryptoWall virus.'b'Even after reading through numerous descriptions of CryptoWall 2.0 as \xe2\x80\x9cthe largest and most destructive ransomware threat on the Internet\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9can enormous danger for computer users,\xe2\x80\x9d I still couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking this was mainly a problem for moms who persist in using big, boxy PC computers and small-town police departments. Mr. Wisniewski quickly disabused me of that notion. Although CryptoWall has primarily affected Windows computers and Android cellphones so far, there is no technological barrier that prevents the virus from infiltrating Macs like mine. And when it does, Mr. Wisniewski chuckled, I should expect the ransom to be a lot higher.'b'So what can we all do to protect ourselves? Keep our computers backed up on an independent drive or by using a cloud backup service like Carbonite, take those software update and \xe2\x80\x9cpatch\xe2\x80\x9d alerts seriously and, most of all, Beware the Attachment. (Remember: Brand-name businesses like J. Crew or Bank of America will rarely send you an attachment.)'b'Of course, this advice arrives too late for my mom. And it appeared her payment had arrived too late as well: By the time I got home from Greenpoint, her CryptoWall ransom had been raised to $1,000, and the $500 in Bitcoins she had deposited had vanished. In a panic, she wrote to Mike Hoats asking for advice. What he told her sounded crazy to me. Use the CryptoWall message interface to tell the criminals exactly what happened. Be honest, in other words.'b'So she did. She explained that the virus had struck the same week that a major snowstorm hit Massachusetts and the Thanksgiving holiday shut down the banks. She told them about the unexpected Bitcoin shortfall and about dispatching her daughter to the Coin Cafe A.T.M. at the 11th hour. She swore she had really, really tried not to miss their deadline. And then a weird thing happened: Her decryption key arrived.'b'When I shared the news with Mr. Hoats, he was jubilant. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is great news, truly!\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWhoever these yahoos are, they have some little shred of humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Mr. Wisniewski had a more pragmatic take. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom what we can tell, they almost always honor what they say because they want word to get around that they\xe2\x80\x99re trustworthy criminals who\xe2\x80\x99ll give you your files back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Welcome to the new ransomware economy, where hackers have a reputation to consider.'b'FRIENDS and family gathered around the limp body of a 15-year-old boy laid out on a bed in a thatched hut near the Brazilian town of Iguatemi, close to the border with Paraguay. A shaman shook a small wooden rattle while chanting and dancing \xe2\x80\x94 final rites for yet another victim of a suicide epidemic that has plagued the Guaran\xc3\xad Indians of the western Brazilian state of Mato Grosso do Sul.'b'The boy, Dedson Garcete, had hanged himself \xe2\x80\x94 one of 36 suicides among tribe members in 2014 through September, and one of about 500 among the tribe of 45,000 since 2004, according to Zelik Trajber, a pediatrician with the special secretariat for indigenous health within the Ministry of Health in Mato Grosso do Sul.'b'Indigenous peoples suffer the greatest suicide risk among cultural or ethnic groups worldwide. Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men ages 25 to 29 have a suicide rate four times higher than the general population in that same age group in Australia, according to the country\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Health.'b'In the United States, suicide is the second leading cause of death, behind accidents, for American Indian and Alaska Native men ages 15 to 34, and is two and a half times higher than the national average for that age group, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.'b'Among the indigenous in Brazil, the suicide rate was six times higher than the national average in 2013, according to a study released in October by Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Health. That translates into 30 suicides per 100,000 people. Among 'b'members of the Guaran\xc3\xad tribe'b', Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s largest, the rate is estimated at more than twice as high as the indigenous rate over all, the study said.'b'In fact it may be even higher. The Indigenous Missionary Council says there were over 70 suicides in 2013, substantially more than the figure of 49 provided by Dr. Trajber.'b'The Guaran\xc3\xad have long made their home in the fertile land of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s southwest, where swaths of vast forests and savannas have been transformed into farms and ranches. In the process, the tribe has been dispossessed and uprooted from its traditional way of life. Many in the tribe face extreme discrimination and live in abject poverty close to the farmers and ranchers who occupy land that was once theirs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving in this nonplace, they commit suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d said Maria de Lourdes Beldi de Alcantara, an anthropologist at the University of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo who for years has studied adolescent suicides among the Guaran\xc3\xad.'b'Nearly 100 years ago, the Guaran\xc3\xad, who today live primarily in Brazil and Paraguay, were forced off their ancestral land when the Brazilian government granted farmers and ranchers the legal title to that land. Tribe members were placed in crowded reservations, and often separated from family members.'b'Then, in 1988, the Brazilian government created a new Constitution that established rights for indigenous people. Among them: giving Guaran\xc3\xad and other indigenous families the right to repossess their ancestral land, a process that has been slow and frustrating for both Indians and farmers and that has put them even more at odds.'b'In many cases, farmers, too, have lived in Mato Grosso do Sul for generations. They raised their families there, and worked and profited from the land, first from mat\xc3\xa9 (a kind of tea), and later from sugar cane and soybeans. Like the Guaran\xc3\xad, they are rooted in the land, making the conflict between landowners and the Guaran\xc3\xad both cultural and material. Where the indigenous see repossession of their ancestral land as integral to revitalizing their cultural traditions and regaining their sense of well-being, ranchers and farmers view it as a hindrance to Brazilian progress and development.'b'James Anaya, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples from 2008 to last May, said suicides among indigenous youth, across the globe, are common in situations where tribe members have seen the upheaval of their culture, which produces in the indigenous a lack of self-confidence and grounding about who they are.'b'In the southwest of Brazil, he said, distress, poverty and violence against tribal leaders have led to despair among Guaran\xc3\xad teenagers, who feel they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a future. \xe2\x80\x9cThey see taking their own lives as unfortunately and sadly an option,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Professor Alcantara said that over the past 10 years tribe members have come to live between two cultures \xe2\x80\x94 the culture of nearby cities, where they are discriminated against, and the culture of their own tribe. Young tribe members, in particular, feel that they don\xe2\x80\x99t belong either to the city or to the tribe, she said.'b'Tonico Benites, a Guaran\xc3\xad and anthropologist, said that during Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s dictatorship of the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s, conditions on Guaran\xc3\xad reservations deteriorated: There was overcrowding and families were split apart. Today, the situation has grown even worse, he said, and many Guaran\xc3\xad feel lonely and isolated.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt some point, many people I knew, friends, had lost their autonomy, their way of supporting themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo they end up thinking about death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Off the reservation, Guaran\xc3\xad have suffered extreme prejudice, threats and worse, Dr. Benites said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happened to me three times, when I was waiting on the side of the road and a truck came at high speeds toward me,\xe2\x80\x9d he recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to jump, otherwise it would have hit and killed me ... and later they\xe2\x80\x99d say it\xe2\x80\x99s an accident, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said pistoleros hired by farmers have burned Guaran\xc3\xad huts, tortured his friends and killed tribal leaders.'b'Mr. Anaya, a law professor at the University of Arizona, said he believes that improving educational systems for the Guaran\xc3\xad and other indigenous groups can help. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need education that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t try to take out of indigenous children their identity but rather helps to reinforce it with all the modern tools that are appropriate to modern life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Both sides want a peaceful solution, but in small Guaran\xc3\xad villages across Mato Grosso do Sul, Guaran\xc3\xad boys like Dedson continue to despair.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur biggest hope, for which we struggle every day,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Benites said, \xe2\x80\x9cis that our children may be happier in the future. That one day they can live another kind of life, a better one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'TEL AVIV \xe2\x80\x94 Here is Amos Oz on writing a novel: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is like reconstructing the whole of Paris from Lego bricks. It\xe2\x80\x99s about three-quarters-of-a-million small decisions. It\xe2\x80\x99s not about who will live and who will die and who will go to bed with whom. Those are the easy ones. It\xe2\x80\x99s about choosing adjectives and adverbs and punctuation. These are molecular decisions that you have to take and nobody will appreciate, for the same reason that nobody ever pays attention to a single note in a symphony in a concert hall, except when the note is false. So you have to work very hard in order for your readers not to note a single false note. That is the business of three-quarters-of-a-million decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I found Oz at the end of his working day, around 8:30 in the morning. He\xe2\x80\x99d been up since 4, as usual, taken a brisk walk, as usual, drunk a coffee, as usual, and settled down at his desk around 5:30. His good working hours for all those decisions are between 5:30 and 8:30. With a novel called \xe2\x80\x9cJudas\xe2\x80\x9d published in Hebrew last year (but not yet out in English), he is at work on something new, but, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cin this business there are many more miscarriages and abortions than live births.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Treason and loyalty are themes of \xe2\x80\x9cJudas.\xe2\x80\x9d They have been on Oz\xe2\x80\x99s mind. \xe2\x80\x9cThe protagonist points out that almost every significant political leader in history was called a traitor by many of his own people \xe2\x80\x94 Abraham Lincoln, de Gaulle, Gorbachev, Begin, Sadat, Rabin,\xe2\x80\x9d the novelist told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe day people in this country start calling Netanyahu a traitor I will know that something may change.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Oz, the conscience of a certain liberal and secular Israel still committed to a two-state outcome, called Benjamin Netanyahu \xe2\x80\x9ca coward, a man who prefers inaction to action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has been in power for some nine years,\xe2\x80\x9d Oz said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn those nine years he has not made one, even one, really controversial decision either way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The result is drift, a status quo that is violent, or brewing with violence. It is an illusion to think of the status quo in anything but violent terms so long as the Palestinian quest for nationhood remains unresolved.'b'This struggle may recede from view for a while, and on a sunny day in a quiet Tel Aviv it may seem infinitely remote, but it is there, the storm at the horizon.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUp until last summer there was a seemingly pragmatic school in the Israeli political middle of the road, former generals and politicians, who claimed it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to resolve the conflict at this time so let\xe2\x80\x99s think about conflict management,\xe2\x80\x9d Oz said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think last summer, the third Gaza war in six years, taught Israelis what conflict management looks like. This may be a useful lesson.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But, I asked, after almost a half-century of occupation of the West Bank, is a two-state peace not on life support? \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I have sad moments, and I have encouraging moments. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t see an alternative. Or rather, the alternative is a disaster for Israelis. The alternative is the end of Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Oz refuses to be pessimistic. He sees the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative as a \xe2\x80\x9cvery reasonable starting point.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps, he suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthe present day is the best chance we had in 110 years to conclude the conflict altogether because Egypt, Jordan, the Saudis, the gulf states, even Assad in Syria, all have a more immediate enemy than Israel, and they are more willing to make a historical compromise with Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But more traitors are needed. An Israeli leader who will give up land for peace, as Menachem Begin, of all people, did with Sinai; an Arab leader, like Anwar el-Sadat, bold enough to be pragmatic rather than peddle empty dreams.'b'Oz laughs at the notion of one state for two peoples. \xe2\x80\x9cIf anyone would have proposed that in 1945 Germany and Poland immediately become a binational state they would put him in a madhouse. How can anyone in Israel or elsewhere think that Israelis and the Palestinians can simply jump into a honeymoon bed together? After generations of hatred, we need a divorce, a fair divorce.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He is right. Israelis and Palestinians need traitors as leaders who will deliver an equitable divorce, ugly as most divorces are, setting the terms for the peaceful coexistence of two states. The thing about traitor-leaders is that they break the rules that seemed immutable.'b"There are none on the horizon, but you never know. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m old enough to know that when somebody says words like \xe2\x80\x98never,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98forever,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98the rest of eternity\xe2\x80\x99 in the Middle East, it usually means something like six months to 30 years. If anyone had said to me as a young man that one day I would travel to Egypt or Jordan with Egyptian and Jordanian visas stamped in my passport, I would have said, \xe2\x80\x98Let\xe2\x80\x99s not get carried away.' \xe2\x80\x9d"b'He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI have seen people change. They are not born again but they change, somewhat. In fact that is how I make a living, by observing and describing the way people change.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Change and three-quarters-of-a-million decisions and before you know it, something new and original, even something unimaginable, is born.'b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 AS Republicans take control of Congress this month, at the top of their to-do list is changing how the government measures the impact of tax cuts on federal revenue: namely, to switch from so-called static scoring to \xe2\x80\x9cdynamic\xe2\x80\x9d scoring. While seemingly arcane, the change could have significant, negative consequences for enacting sustainable, long-term fiscal policies.'b'Whenever new tax legislation is proposed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \xe2\x80\x9cscores\xe2\x80\x9d it, to estimate whether the bill would raise more or less revenue than existing law would.'b'In preparing estimates, scorekeepers try to predict how people will respond to a new tax law. For example, if Congress contemplates raising the excise tax on cigarettes, scorekeepers consider existing trends in cigarette consumption, the likelihood that the higher taxes will induce some smokers to quit, and the prospect that higher prices will increase incentives for cigarette smuggling. There are no truly \xe2\x80\x9cstatic\xe2\x80\x9d revenue estimates.'b'These conventional estimates do not, however, include any indirect feedback effects that tax law changes might have on overall national income. In other words, they do not incorporate macroeconomic behavioral changes.'b'Dynamic scoring does. Proponents point out, correctly, that if a tax proposal is large enough, then those sorts of feedback effects can aim the entire economy on a slightly different path.'b'Such proponents argue that conventional projections are skewed against tax cuts, because they do not consider that cutting taxes could lead to higher economic output, which would make up at least some of the lost revenues. They maintain that dynamic scoring will, therefore, be both more neutral and more accurate than current methodologies.'b'But the reality is more complex. In order to look at the effects across the entire economy, dynamic modeling relies on many simplifying assumptions, like how well people can predict the future or how much they care about their children\xe2\x80\x99s future consumption versus their own.'b'Economists disagree on the answers, and different models\xe2\x80\x99 predicted feedback effects vary wildly, depending on the values selected for those uncertain assumptions. The resulting estimates are likely to incorporate greater uncertainty about the magnitude of any revenue-estimating errors and greater exposure to the risk of a political thumb on the scale.'b'Consider the nonpartisan scorekeepers\xe2\x80\x99 estimates of the consequences of a tax-reform bill proposed last year by Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan. Using different models and plausible inputs, the scorekeepers estimated that, under the bill, total gross domestic product might rise between 0.1 percent and 1.6 percent over the next decade \xe2\x80\x94 a 16-fold spread in projected outcomes. Which result should be the basis of congressional scorekeeping?'b'But the bigger problems lie deeper. Federal deficits are on an unsustainable path (as it happens, because of undertaxation, not excessive spending). Simply cutting taxes against the headwind of structural deficits leads to lower growth, as government borrowing soaks up an ever-increasing share of savings.'b'The most optimistic dynamic models get around this by assuming that the world today is in fiscal equilibrium, where the deficit does not grow continuously as a percentage of gross domestic product. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not true. If you add the reality of spiraling deficits into those models, they don\xe2\x80\x99t work.'b'To make these models work, scorekeepers must arbitrarily assume either that we tax more and spend less today than is really the case \xe2\x80\x94 which is what they did for the Camp bill \xe2\x80\x94 or assume that a tax cut today will be followed by a spending cut or tax increase tomorrow. Economists describe such a move as \xe2\x80\x9cmaking counterfactual assumptions\xe2\x80\x9d; the rest of us call it \xe2\x80\x9cmaking stuff up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In practice, these models are political statements. They show the biggest economic effects by assuming that tax cuts are financed by unspecified future spending cuts. The smaller size of government, not the tax cuts by themselves, largely drives the models\xe2\x80\x99 results.'b'Further, the models are not a step toward more neutral revenue estimates, because they assume that, while individuals make productive investments, government does not. In reality, government spending contributes significantly to economic output. Truly dynamic modeling would weigh the forgone economic returns of government investments against the economic gains from lower taxes.'b'The Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 interest in dynamic scoring is not the result of a million-economist march on Washington; it comes from political factions convinced that tax cuts are the panacea for all economic ills. They will use dynamic scoring to justify a tax cut that, under conventional scorekeeping, loses revenue.'b'When revenues do in fact decline and deficits rise, those same proponents will push for steep cuts in government insurance or investment programs, because they will claim that the models demand it. That is what lies inside the Trojan horse of dynamic scoring.'b'Imagine a lender demanding that you miss a payment. That is the situation described 'b'in a recent article in The Wall Street Journal'b'. In 2013, GSO Capital Partners, the debt-investing arm of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, refused to renew a $122.3 million loan to the Spanish gambling company Codere unless it delayed paying interest on other existing debt. Why? It turns out that GSO had placed a bet that Codere\xe2\x80\x99s existing debt would not be paid on time. When, lo and behold, the payment was late, GSO collected on its bet.'b'The bet in this scenario was a credit default swap, in which one party to the transaction \xe2\x80\x94 say, a bank, hedge fund, insurer or other institutional investor \xe2\x80\x94 agrees to pay the other party in the event of a bond default. Credit default swaps, a type of derivative, can be used to hedge against losses on bonds that investors own, or to speculate on how the underlying companies will perform.'b'If this sounds familiar, it should. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, banks and investors gorged on toxic mortgage bonds that were supposedly \xe2\x80\x9cinsured\xe2\x80\x9d against loss with credit default swaps. When the bonds went bad, many swaps turned out to be worthless as well, necessitating bailouts to cushion catastrophic losses.'b'The Dodd-Frank financial reform law was supposed to curb speculation in swaps. But as The Journal has reported, hedge funds are increasingly using swaps to wager on whether weak firms will live or die. RadioShack, the troubled consumer electronics retailer, is one of several prominent examples. In December, RadioShack\xe2\x80\x99s total debt came to about $1.4 billion, but swaps outstanding on the performance of the debt totaled $23.5 billion. Similarly, J.C. Penney, the ailing department store chain, had total debt of some $8.7 billion, but swaps outstanding on the debt totaled $19.3 billion.'b'Those gaps suggest excessive speculation, though it is hard, if not impossible, to gauge the precise exposure of funds to big losses. What is known is that a hedge fund that is betting on a company\xe2\x80\x99s default has an incentive to push it over the edge. Conversely, a fund that is betting a troubled company will not default has an incentive to keep it afloat, at least long enough to avoid a big payout. Either way, the company becomes a pawn in a financial game.'b'Speculative activity is likely to increase. Last month, Congress repealed an anti-speculation provision of Dodd-Frank that would have prevented federally insured banks from conducting several types of swap transactions. In addition, the Federal Reserve recently gave the banks two extra years to meet a Dodd-Frank provision requiring them to sell their investments in private equity funds and hedge funds.'b'The next crisis will differ from the last crisis in its origins and effects. But it is probably safe to assume that sooner or later, poorly regulated credit derivatives will again play a role in damaging the economy.'b'Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, came on the political scene with a surpassing idealism about the potential of government and a passion for defending its power to address the plights and hopes of ordinary citizens. Well before his three terms ended, he had become an eloquent champion of those values for the entire country.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the heart of the matter we are bound one to another,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cuomo declared in his keynote speech that electrified the 1984 Democratic National Convention, a speech many Americans replayed on the Internet after Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s death on Thursday.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMake this nation remember how futures are built,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said'b', in stirring words that resounded with New Deal liberalism and directly challenged President Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to public service was a rebuke of that idea. His career may have been rich in might-have-beens \xe2\x80\x94 a presidential run? a Supreme Court seat? \xe2\x80\x94 but Mr. Cuomo was resolutely true to himself at critical moments.'b'He stoutly defended abortion rights in the face of opposition from the leaders of his Catholic faith. He repeatedly vetoed attempts to restore the death penalty in the face of legislators\xe2\x80\x99 grandstanding. As a gifted mediator, he helped settle a riot at Sing Sing prison in which 19 hostage guards were freed, in contrast to the 1971 Attica prison riot in which 10 hostages and 33 inmates died.'b'No one seemed more refreshing in the grueling politics of New York than Mr. Cuomo when he came out of Queens in the 1970s to challenge City Hall\xe2\x80\x99s condemnation of a working-class Corona neighborhood for redevelopment. The courtroom orator cited each lawn Madonna and backyard vineyard of residents he knew by name.'b'In his convention speech more than a decade later, he called for government to defend the full array of powerless Americans, from unemployed steelworkers to the homeless in Chicago. He had burnished this message as a political neophyte and incumbent, always telling of his parents\xe2\x80\x99 immigrant strivings and hopes. His death is being mourned by generations of New Yorkers, and his son, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, in his own second inaugural address on Thursday, paid homage to his father\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs.'b'Much of what Mr. Cuomo said at the 1984 convention feels prophetically relevant in today\xe2\x80\x99s debate about the wealth gap between the top 1 percenters and all the Americans below. He excoriated Republicans for a policy of \xe2\x80\x9cmake the rich richer,\xe2\x80\x9d warning that the nation was more of a \xe2\x80\x9ctale of two cities\xe2\x80\x9d than a \xe2\x80\x9cshining city on the hill.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For all his idealism, Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s years as governor were dogged by economic recession that blunted his hopes to leave great programs and innovation as his legacy. He had to cut services and scratch for scarce revenue.'b'What he certainly left, however, was a demonstration that the power to inspire citizens to demand a more humane society and better government is a vital gift.'b'It has taken far too long, but federal authorities are finally asking the right questions about how New York\xe2\x80\x99s part-time lawmakers make money apart from their legislative salaries. The Times 'b'reported'b' Tuesday that investigators are examining \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d secret payments from a small law firm to one of New York\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful politicians, Speaker Sheldon Silver of the Assembly. So far, there has been no real explanation from Mr. Silver.'b'A small band of reformers are hopeful that United States Attorney Preet Bharara and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may soon be able to shed light on how New York legislators amass income and whether it is connected to legislative payoffs that in effect amount to bribery.'b'Historically, legislators who are practicing lawyers, like Mr. Silver and Senator Dean Skelos, who will be running the State Senate, have provided only general outlines of income and its sources, partly on the specious grounds that saying more would violate attorney-client privilege.'b'Mr. Silver has for years acknowledged that he is associated with Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, a personal injury firm. His most recent financial disclosure form showed about $650,000 from legal work. Federal authorities are now asking questions not only about the money he has disclosed but about what he has done to earn the large, undisclosed sums he has received for nearly a decade from Goldberg &amp; Iryami, P.C. The Goldberg firm specializes in challenging tax assessments and seeking tax reductions, which is not known to be Mr. Silver\xe2\x80\x99s main area of expertise.'b'State ethics laws are incredibly feeble, and penalties for violations can be little more than a tap on the wrist for someone as wealthy as Mr. Silver. Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed stricter disclosure requirements in 2014 and got almost nowhere. Mr. Bharara and his federal troops are combing through data left behind after Mr. Cuomo abruptly shut down the Moreland Commission on ethics, which was investigating the issue. They may be able to find the answers that have eluded others. In time, detailed disclosures of outside income should be required by state law.'b'When Hillary Clinton thinks about running for president, do you think she contemplates the fact that no Democrat has been elected to succeed another Democrat since James Buchanan in 1856?'b'We bring you this factoid in honor of the beginning of the 2016 election season. (Only 55 weeks until the New Hampshire primary!) We\xe2\x80\x99ve got so much time. It\xe2\x80\x99s the perfect moment for random irrelevant trivia about presidential elections of the past. Which, to be honest, is my favorite part.'b'Consider that succession information for a minute. We have had Democratic vice presidents step into office when the Democratic president died. But the voters haven\xe2\x80\x99t gone to the polls and elected one Democrat to follow another since before the Civil War.'b'What do you think this means? Actually, there weren\xe2\x80\x99t all that many Republicans who were elected to succeed Republicans either. Particularly if you acknowledge that Rutherford B. Hayes 'b'stole the election from Samuel Tilden'b'. James Garfield did it, but then he was assassinated. William Howard Taft followed Theodore Roosevelt, and then Roosevelt came to hate Taft so much that he ran as a third-party candidate in 1912, throwing the election to Woodrow Wilson. Herbert Hoover succeeded Calvin Coolidge, and we know how well that one worked out. Finally, George H.W. Bush was elected after Ronald Reagan.'b'Wow, think about that. The only president elected to follow a member of his own party without creating some sort of cosmic disaster was George H.W. Bush. No wonder he always looks so cheerful.'b'These factoids refer only to elections between Republicans and Democrats. Even with nearly two years to go (but seven months until the Iowa straw poll!), we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough time to deal with the Whigs. Our two current parties began duking it out in \xe2\x80\x94 yes! \xe2\x80\x94 1856, when Buchanan ran against the first Republican presidential candidate, John Charles Fr\xc3\xa9mont. Fr\xc3\xa9mont was an explorer whose political enemies claimed had resorted to cannibalism during one unfortunate Western expedition. I am just telling you this to make it clear how interesting American history can be.'b'Anyhow, Buchanan won and went on triumphantly to become possibly the worst president ever. Almost every chief executive in American history has his defenders. I had a very nice time last year talking with people who feel Warren Harding hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been given his due. But you very seldom run into fans of Buchanan, the man who cozied up to slaveholders and failed to stop Southern secession.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jean Baker, a professor of history at Goucher College and Buchanan biographer. This despite arriving in office with one of the best r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s in the history of presidential candidates: Buchanan had been a congressman, envoy to Russia, senator, secretary of state and minister to Britain. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was sitting around waiting and waiting with the best C.V. of any president we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had. That\xe2\x80\x99s what\xe2\x80\x99s so ironic,\xe2\x80\x9d said Baker.'b'Did I mention that Buchanan was also the last former secretary of state elected president?'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think Clinton-Buchanan commonalities are likely to be a big concern. Liberals worry that Hillary might be overly aggressive when it comes to foreign policy; I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody thinks she\xe2\x80\x99d sit on her hands and let any states secede. (Only 58 weeks until the South Carolina primary!)'b'Still, it never hurts to push a little random presidential history into the mix, if only to liven things up for the next year or so. Any suggestions? I am in the market for some comparisons between Ted Cruz and Millard Fillmore.'b'But about James Buchanan: Professor Baker thinks his unwillingness to stand up to the South was because, at least partly, of his close friendships with Southern politicians. (He described the abolition movement as \xe2\x80\x9cweak, powerless and soon to be forgotten\xe2\x80\x9d and referred to white men from the South as \xe2\x80\x9cthe chivalrous race.\xe2\x80\x9d) Buchanan roomed with William King of Alabama during their Senate days, and the pair were so close that people referred to them as \xe2\x80\x9cSiamese twins.\xe2\x80\x9d King went on to become the only bachelor vice president, under Franklin Pierce. Buchanan, you may recall, was our only bachelor president.'b'Baker said that when she was writing her book on Buchanan, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., her editor, demanded that she \xe2\x80\x9ctake a position on whether he was gay or not.\xe2\x80\x9d She demurred. Buchanan never said, and he spent a great deal of time pretending to be courting various widows, none of whom managed to get him anywhere near the altar. Baker wishes she could have said for sure: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been one of the few things I could present as positive about James Buchanan.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, he was kind to his nephews and nieces. He had two pet bald eagles, which sounds sort of interesting. And he was the only president who hailed from Pennsylvania. Perhaps I should point out that Joe Biden was born in Scranton.'b'Sometimes an award means more to the giver than the recipient. That is probably the case with the French government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give the Legion of Honor to Thomas Piketty, the economist and author of the critically acclaimed book about inequality, \xe2\x80\x9cCapital in the Twenty-First Century,\xe2\x80\x9d who 'b'says'b' he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want the award.'b'While he is not the first person to refuse the honor, his decision is notable because it comes at a time when the government of President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande has been struggling to revive the slow-growing French economy. Mr. Piketty says it is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe government\xe2\x80\x99s role to decide who is honorable.\xe2\x80\x9d He went on to add insult to injury by saying the award givers \xe2\x80\x9cwould do better to concentrate on reviving growth in France and Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Legion of Honor, which was 'b'created by'b' Napoleon Bonaparte, has a history of controversy. Several notable French citizens, including'b' Claude Monet, Simone de Beauvoir 'b'and Jean-Paul Sartre, have rejected it for various reasons, including not wanting to be linked to the government of the day. Mr. Sartre 'b'also refused'b' the Nobel Prize for Literature. And there is a tradition of Britons like the singer David Bowie 'b'rejecting royal honors'b'.'b'It is not hard to see why the French government would want to honor Mr. Piketty. His nearly 700-page book, first published in France in 2013, became a sensation in the world of economics and politics. Leading economists like Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman have heaped praise on the book, which spent 'b'22 weeks'b' on The Times\xe2\x80\x99s hardcover best-seller list. It documented how countries around the world have increasingly become unequal, with wealth concentrated among a tiny elite at the top. In the book, Mr. Piketty also proposes a global wealth tax to address inequality.'b'While Mr. Piketty has basked in acclaim, Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s economic policies have made him deeply unpopular. In the 'b'third quarter'b' of 2014, the French economy grew just 0.3 percent compared to the previous quarter. And recent 'b'polls'b' have found that Mr. Hollande would get fewer votes in a contest against the right-wing politician Marine Le Pen and his predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy.'b'As much as political leaders might think that official awards are about honoring achievement, they\xe2\x80\x99re also about sharing in reflected glory. In this case, Mr. Piketty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to want to share.'b'DAVIS, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 IT\xe2\x80\x99S been widely observed that in recent elections men have leaned Republican and women Democratic. A key element of that gender gap is often assumed to be a difference in attitudes to women\xe2\x80\x99s reproductive rights.'b'The perception that men and women have divergent views on abortion has persisted over time. The line popularized by Gloria Steinem that \xe2\x80\x9cif men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament\xe2\x80\x9d proposes that a male-female divide over this social issue is more or less a biological given.'b'The polling confounds such stereotypes. 'b'The General Social Survey'b', which has been tracking American opinions for decades, includes the question of whether a woman should be allowed to get an abortion if she \xe2\x80\x9cwants it for any reason.\xe2\x80\x9d In 17 of the 23 years that this question has been asked, men have answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to a greater extent than women. The average difference was about 1.5 percentage points \xe2\x80\x94 a small but consistent gender gap, if not the one people seem to expect.'b'So what is it about women that makes them less enthusiastic than men about abortion on demand? Again, the survey offers answers. Using a common statistical method, one can determine the effect of different variables on an outcome of interest \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, the odds that someone will agree or disagree with the question. This reveals that the difference between men and women is not, in fact, likely because of their sex, but because of other factors that happen to correlate with sex.'b'As it happens, religious attendance and biblical literalism, as well as political ideology, were all highly predictive of attitudes toward abortion. Being Hispanic was also associated with being opposed to abortion on demand (even allowing for other variables, such as religiosity).'b'In contrast, sex and age were usually not independently significant. Probably the mediating factor here is that, according to most surveys, women tend to be more religious than men.'b'While, on the whole, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a major difference in the sexes\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes toward abortion, there is one when we separate men and women by ideology. If we look at the data since 2000 (to get a more contemporary perspective), on the liberal end of the ideological spectrum men are consistently less supportive of abortion on demand than women. On the conservative end of the spectrum, it\xe2\x80\x99s women who like abortion on demand less than men do.'b'In other words, conservative women are the most anti-abortion segment of the population, and liberal women are the most in favor of abortion rights. You might say that the more significant difference here is not between men and women, but among women.'b'It may be that some have generalized this difference \xe2\x80\x94 men being less enthusiastic about abortion on demand among liberals \xe2\x80\x94 to the whole population. 'b'The critic Pauline Kael\xe2\x80\x99s 1972 assertion'b' that she personally knew only one person who voted for President Richard M. Nixon has become a favorite illustration of the cultural isolation of liberal elites. But this may simply be the reality, that Americans are 'b'ideologically polarized and inhabit different'b' and mutually exclusive social worlds.'b'Stereotypes flourish in ignorance. Liberal and conservative perceptions of one another can be ignorant and patronizing because they have so little personal experience of one another. Intriguingly, 'b'research by the social psychologists Jesse Graham, Brian A. Nozek and Jonathan Haidt'b' has shown that liberals exhibit the least accurate perception of those with opposing political views.'b'Our liking for black-and-white versions of reality is belied by their more shaded truths. Even among \xe2\x80\x9cextremely liberal\xe2\x80\x9d women in the General Social Survey, over 25 percent did not accept an unequivocal abortion-rights position. Meanwhile, among \xe2\x80\x9cextremely conservative\xe2\x80\x9d women, nearly one-fifth (18.2 percent) did.'b'So, yes, there is a large gap between these ideologically polarized positions, but we miss a substantial proportion of the electorate if all we apprehend is the stylized cartoon. Nuance goes out the window when slogans about the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on women\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cliberal media\xe2\x80\x9d dominate public discourse.'b'All this has important consequences for a pluralistic society in which politics aspires to be the art of persuasion. Abortion is arguably the most polarizing social issue in the United States, and 'b'despite the data at our fingertips'b', many succumb to caricatures of their opponents.'b'A greater engagement with the facts would enable those who support abortion rights to consider why so many women do not, rather than dismissing their political opponents as motivated by misogyny or false consciousness. Equally, looking at the 'b'skewed racial demographics of abortion'b' might encourage conservatives to reconsider the idea that reproductive justice is purely a concern of privileged white feminists.'b'We live in a world with a surfeit of information at our service. It is our choice whether we seek out data that reinforce our biases or choose to look at the world in a critical, rational manner, and allow reality to bend our preconceptions. In the long run, the truth will work better for us than our cherished fictions.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cMario M.

An official statement by the Egyptian ministry of foreign affairs, issued on the same day, explicitly stated that she was in violation of the visa requirements.'b'Egyptian laws and statutes stipulate that only tourist visas can be issued at the Egyptian ports of entry. Business visas, without exception, have to be obtained in advance from an Egyptian embassy.'b'Ms. Dunne contacted the embassy on Dec. 8 and was made aware of the visa requirements. She applied on Dec. 10, but failed to provide a passport photograph or pay the required fees. Upon being notified by the consular staff that the processing time for a visa is 10 days, she asked to withdraw her application. Clearly, she decided to take her chances at the airport, hoping to get a tourist visa. She was denied entry for failing to comply with the visa requirements.'b'Ms. Dunne\xe2\x80\x99s views, research interests or scholarly distinction are irrelevant to the issue at hand. Anyone visiting Egypt on business, however distinguished he or she might be, must respect Egyptian laws and regulations if he wishes to enter Egypt. This requirement is not in any way unusual or unreasonable, nor is it something that only Egypt requires.'b'Violation of United States visa requirements, for instance, results in the immediate denial of entry, and entry upon false pretense (such as conducting business after entering on a tourist visa) makes one liable to prosecution. Egypt is entitled to the same right to respect for its sovereignty and laws.'b'MOHAMED TAWFIK'b'\nAmbassador of Egypt'b'\nWashington, Dec. 18, 2014'b''b''b'HONG KONG \xe2\x80\x94 A FEW years back I got a call from a film director based in China who had read one of my detective novels. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you help me write a screenplay for a crime story?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tricky thing is that it\xe2\x80\x99s set in Beijing, so no crime can be involved.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Welcome to the world of screenwriting for China, where crime stories are crime free, ghost tales have no ghosts and crooked politicians can\xe2\x80\x99t be crooked.'b'China has a large film industry and the second-biggest box office in the world, but few people outside the country have ever watched a Chinese movie released there: Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen one acrobatic hero single-handedly dispatch an enemy platoon, you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a lifetime\xe2\x80\x99s worth. For that, you can blame the rules of film censorship in China, and a Chinese government extremely sensitive about how the nation is portrayed.'b'No one can start making a film in China without submitting the plot to the State General Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television (SGAPPRFT), an agency set up to administer government-owned media but best known (and feared) as a committee of censors. If any organization from outside mainland China is involved, including Hong Kong partners, a full screenplay must be submitted for review. Once approved, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be modified, meaning actors and directors must resist any urge to improvise during filming.'b'At irregular intervals the agency provides a list of unmentionables. Sex scenes or depictions of \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive drinking, smoking and other bad habits\xe2\x80\x9d are a no-go. \xe2\x80\x9cPropagating passive or negative outlook on life, worldview and value system\xe2\x80\x9d is banned; so is \xe2\x80\x9cstirring up ambivalence and conflicts between different religions or sects, and between believers and nonbelievers, causing disharmony in the community.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The vetting committee might reject a story line for being \xe2\x80\x9cunscientific,\xe2\x80\x9d because, say, it features time travel. It also bans \xe2\x80\x9chistorical untruths,\xe2\x80\x9d which, this being China, often means historical truths.'b'The ethnicity of villains is a major concern as well. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\xe2\x80\x99s about international crime, the bad guy must not be Chinese,\xe2\x80\x9d explained a Hong Kong screenwriter with 25 years\xe2\x80\x99 experience. (He asked not to be identified for fear of being blacklisted.) Furthermore, the crime must not be initiated within China\xe2\x80\x99s borders, as if the land itself were somehow pure. All characters in the uniformed services must be good guys. Government employees may never be corrupt. There are no prostitutes in China.'b'Getting a SGAPPRFT permit is just the first hurdle. If the hero is a monk or the setting is a temple or a church, the script will also require a permit from the State Administration for Religious Affairs. If it\xe2\x80\x99s a spy movie, national security agents will have to vet it. For cop shows, you need approval from the police\xe2\x80\x99s so-called art department.'b'Ghost stories are farcically problematic. In the spring of 2006, an online novel by Zhang Muye called \xe2\x80\x9cGui Chui Deng\xe2\x80\x9d (literally \xe2\x80\x9cGhost Blows Out the Light\xe2\x80\x9d) was enormously popular. It was read by millions. There was much excited discussion about a print version and an international movie adaptation. Then the project stalled. The government-licensed version of the book published in print was purged of any reference to the supernatural, and with that, the film project vanished, too.'b'At least half of Hong Kong movies today are co-produced with mainland organizations, and screenwriters here are also having to toe the Beijing line. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why we usually make \xe2\x80\x98ancient swordsman\xe2\x80\x99 films, or stories that happen in the period before the founding of the New China,\xe2\x80\x9d the Hong Kong screenwriter explained. He meant that you can show something negative in mainland China only so long as it happened before the Communist revolution in 1949 \xe2\x80\x94 but be careful not to portray that period as a golden era, because for that you might get censored.'b'Can a good story be written under such conditions? It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult. Some screenwriters have managed through cunning: One director squeaked a crime movie set in Hong Kong past the censors after claiming the action took place before the transfer in 1997, while the territory was still under the rule of those evil Brits.'b'More often, the rules kill creativity. The 2002 Hong Kong movie \xe2\x80\x9cInfernal Affairs,\xe2\x80\x9d a gripping tale about a triad member who infiltrates the police, was remade in Hollywood as \xe2\x80\x9cThe Departed,\xe2\x80\x9d which won four Oscars, including one for best adapted screenplay. In the original, the gangster antihero ultimately avoids being exposed by killing someone in his own gang. Is he still faking it, or has he become the top cop he was pretending to be? In the version of the film that was reshot in China, the ending is a clunker: Confronted by police officers who accuse him of being a mole, he turns in his badge without a word.'b'That crime story I co-wrote with the Chinese director had to be rejiggered multiple times. It eventually resulted in an implausible tale about an Italian businessman who flies into Beijing, steals a huge cache of art treasures, and flies out while pursued by noble detectives of Chinese origin. It was never filmed, to my relief.'b'The problem is not about to go away. According to Xinhua, the state-run news agency, China\xe2\x80\x99s uncompromising president, Xi Jinping, told a forum of writers in October, \xe2\x80\x9cThe arts must serve the people and serve socialism.\xe2\x80\x9d Anthony Lee, a Hong Kong Polytechnic University lecturer on entertainment, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe buzz in the industry is that the toughness of China\xe2\x80\x99s new leader is making things harder, not easier.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Screenwriters may find some hope in the fact that in the long run the Chinese public, and investors, will demand global standards of story writing. On a domestic airline in China recently, I noted that a movie showing a lone Chinese hero defeating a Japanese horde was playing on drop-down screens. Not one passenger seemed to be watching it. Instead many were watching Hollywood films on portable devices.'b'THE annual ritual of the New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ll lose 10 pounds, get my finances in order, be more patient with my family, feel more grateful \xe2\x80\x94 misses the point. We try to steel our wills to do what we already know we should be doing. Kick-in-the-pants reminders, however stern, are missed opportunities for genuine self-renewal. (Not to mention that the shelf life of any motivational juice we generate in January tends to expire in February.)'b'The turning over of a new year is an opportunity to create ourselves anew. How? The key, I suggest, is in shifting our understanding of the choices we make. For many people, the most important choices in life are sources of agony, dread, paralysis \xe2\x80\x94 even depression or suicide. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have to be like this.'b'A hypothetical example: Eve works as a textbook editor at a Boston publishing house and was approached by a small but prestigious imprint on the West Coast that was looking for a fiction editor. The job would be a big promotion, with a significant raise, and Eve had always wanted to work in fiction.'b'But Eve is in crisis. Should she move her husband and young daughter from their cozy life in Boston, her home of 15 years, to the wilds of California? If she stays, will she be forsaking the opportunity of a lifetime? If she moves, will her new boss turn out to be a jerk? Will her child be bullied at school? What if her husband can\xe2\x80\x99t find a good job? Will the family quarrel, the marriage dissolve, her boss fire her for being incompetent, and she and her child end up on food stamps in a homeless shelter?'b'Many people are like Eve and see their choices as, in essence, problems of computation. But choosing between jobs is not like computing the distance between Memphis and Mumbai. The view of choice as a matter of calculating maximal value is assumed in cost-benefit analysis, government policy making and much of economic theory. It\xe2\x80\x99s even embedded in the apps you can download that purport to help you decide whether to buy a new car, get married or change jobs.'b'At the heart of this model is a simple assumption: that what you should choose is always determined by facts in the world about which option has more value \xe2\x80\x94 facts that, if only you were smart enough to discover, would make decision-making relatively easy.'b'But the assumption is false. When we compute distances, there are only three possibilities: one distance is more than, less than or equal to another. Similarly, when we compute value, there are only three possibilities: one thing is better than, worse than or just as good as another. But we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t assume that goodness is like distance. Values don\xe2\x80\x99t have the same structure as facts.'b'Options can be \xe2\x80\x9con a par\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 different in value while being in the same overall neighborhood. If your alternatives are on a par, you can\xe2\x80\x99t make a mistake of reason in choosing one instead of the other. Since one isn\xe2\x80\x99t better than the other, you can\xe2\x80\x99t choose wrongly. But nor are they equally good. When alternatives are on a par, when the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t determine a single right thing to do, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that value writ large has been exhausted. Instead of looking outward to find the value that determines what you should do, you can look inward to what you can stand behind, commit to, resolve to throw yourself behind. By committing to an option, you can confer value on it.'b'Of course, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that you should commit to being a first-class jerk, pedophile or murderer. That\xe2\x80\x99s because being a jerk is not on a par with being a good person.'b'When we choose between options that are on a par, we make ourselves the authors of our own lives. Instead of being led by the nose by what we imagine to be facts of the world, we should instead recognize that sometimes the world is silent about what we should do. In those cases, we can create value for ourselves by committing to an option. By doing so, we not only create value for ourselves but we also (re)create ourselves. Eve might resolve to make her life in Boston. Someone else, in her shoes, might resolve to start a new life in California. There is no error here, only different resolutions that create different sorts of people.'b'So Eve, faced with her choice, should reflect on what kind of person she can be. Can she be someone who abandons a contented life for a new adventure? A choice between alternatives that are on a par is a precious opportunity to create the sort of person she can commit to being, by committing to being that sort of person.'b'Many of the choices we face in the new year will be between alternatives that are on a par. Our task then is to reflect on what kind of person we can commit to being when making those choices. Can we commit to forgoing a much-needed new car and give the money to charity instead? Can we commit to staying in a secure 9-to-5 job rather than starting the business we\xe2\x80\x99ve always dreamed of? Can we commit to having a parent with Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s move in with us, rather than paying to put her in a nursing home?'b'So in this new year, let\xe2\x80\x99s not do the same old, same old; let\xe2\x80\x99s not resolve to work harder at being the selves that we already are. Instead, let\xe2\x80\x99s resolve to make ourselves into the selves that we can commit to being.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 WHY do we have such punitive attitudes toward old people? Granted, the ancients did hideous things to elders who were unable to work but still needed food and care, but in more recent times, that had changed: In 18th-century New England, it was common for people to make themselves seem older by 'b'adding 'b'years to their real age, rather than subtracting them.'b'Once upon a time, \xe2\x80\x9csenile\xe2\x80\x9d just meant old, without being pejorative. Even \xe2\x80\x9cgeriatric\xe2\x80\x9d was originally a value-free term, rather than part of the lexicon of contempt toward old people.'b'Yet today, the language used to describe the changing age composition of the population is little short of apocalyptic. We\xe2\x80\x99re told that the \xe2\x80\x9cgraying of America\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9cagequake\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cdemographic time bomb.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Older people are likely to be seen as a burden and a drain on resources, rather than a resource in themselves. Their only contribution, it seems, is to make worse the \xe2\x80\x9cdependency ratio,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that enshrines dubious assumptions about who will be financially dependent on whom.'b'In 2050, 'b'Americans age 65 and over are predicted to almost double in number to 83.7 million'b', one-fifth of the population. An aging population does pose real challenges, but increasing numbers of people of working age (as traditionally defined) are unemployed today, while growing numbers continue to work beyond pensionable age.'b'In reality, age can no longer be neatly correlated with economic activity. In particular, old people are themselves significant providers of care, notably the child care provided by grandparents.'b'To be sure, some older public figures attain \xe2\x80\x9cnational treasure\xe2\x80\x9d status, as cuddly, unthreatening George Burns-type figures. And while \xe2\x80\x9cageist\xe2\x80\x9d language demeans and 'b'caregivers\xe2\x80\x99 pay remains poor'b', we no longer cast old people out into the wilds. Instead, innovative services and goods are developing that seek to capitalize on the \xe2\x80\x9csilver dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the social bias is real, too. When a large sample of Facebook groups created by 20- to 29-year-olds was 'b'examined by a team based at the Yale School of Public Health'b', three-quarters of the groups were found to denigrate old people. More than a third advocated banning old people from public activities like shopping.'b'Such \xe2\x80\x9cgerontophobia\xe2\x80\x9d is harmful because we internalize it. Ageism 'b'has been described as prejudice against one\xe2\x80\x99s future self'b'. It tells us that age is our defining characteristic and that, as midnight strikes on a milestone birthday, we will become nothing but old \xe2\x80\x94 emptied of our passions, abilities and experience, infused instead with frailty and decline.'b''b'In their study comparing the memory of young and old Chinese and Americans'b', Ellen Langer, a social psychologist, and Becca Levy, an epidemiologist, found that the older Chinese people, who, it was hypothesized, were exposed to less ageism than their American counterparts, performed memory tests more like their younger compatriots. Among the Americans, on the other hand, there were significant memory differences between the old and young. The beliefs that we imbibe about our waning powers may turn out to be self-fulfilling. In effect, our culture teaches us how to be old.'b'The historians Thomas R. Cole and David Hackett Fischer have documented how, at the start of the 19th century, the idea of aging as part of the human condition, with its inevitable limits, increasingly gave way to a conception of old age as a biomedical problem to which there might be a scientific solution. What was lost was a sense of the life span, with each stage having value and meaning.'b'Perhaps this is why, as a 2006 study found, 'b'we mispredict the happiness we expect to feel across the course of our lives'b' and assume that we\xe2\x80\x99ll get more unhappy as we age. In fact, the research shows that the opposite is true. For my part, at 64, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t attained serenity (another stereotype of older people), but I am more able to savor life \xe2\x80\x94 and if offered the chance to return to my 14-year-old self, I\xe2\x80\x99d run screaming the other way.'b'A student of mine, nudging 60, recently called age \xe2\x80\x9cthe great liberator.\xe2\x80\x9d Part of what she meant was that old people simply care less about what others think, but also, I think, that our sense of what\xe2\x80\x99s important grows with age. We experience life more intensely than before, whatever our physical limitations, because we know it won\xe2\x80\x99t last forever.'b'How to enable the growing numbers of old people to live comfortable, meaningful lives is a fundamental issue of equality, with benefits for all. If we make the world better for old people, we make it better for everyone, from stroller-pushers to wheelchair-users.'b''b'Maggie Kuhn, the founder of the elder advocacy organization the Gray Panthers, 'b'argued that instead of making a fetish of independence, we should value the idea of interdependence between generations. Thus 'b'age-friendly cities, like Portland, Ore., rethink urban spaces'b' to make them more accessible and encourage the integration of old people into communal life. And programs 'b'like Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s intergenerational charter schools'b', which provide lifelong education alongside grades K-8, break down the age apartheid now so common. Instead of seeing each other as generic categories, old and young people can discover each other as individuals.'b'Age resistance is a futile kind of life resistance: We can\xe2\x80\x99t live outside time, we begin to age the moment we\xe2\x80\x99re born. But the emerging age-acceptance movement neither decries nor denies the aging process. It recognizes that one can remain vital and present, engaged and curious, indeed continue to grow, until one\xe2\x80\x99s dying breath. Then we need only echo the wish of the British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott: \xe2\x80\x9cMay I be alive when I die.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'IN the new year, it goes without saying that we should all eat more vegetables, exercise more often, tweet or text a little less and pray a little more. But for the professional pundit, there\xe2\x80\x99s really only one resolution that matters: Be less wrong.'b'So in that spirit, here is my annual inventory of the places where I went astray in 2014, offered in the hope that beginning 2015 with a confession will lead to fewer mistakes in the year to come.'b'1. 'b'I thought Jeb Bush wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really serious about 2016.'b' In two columns on the Republican presidential field, in 'b'March'b' and in 'b'November'b', I didn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly write off a Bush candidacy. But I spent far more time on Marco Rubio (whose chances I felt were being underestimated) and Rand Paul, and to a lesser extent Chris Christie and Ted Cruz, than I did on the former Florida governor.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s because I strongly suspected various forces would keep Bush on the sidelines: his wife\xe2\x80\x99s likely opposition, a sense of Bush-dynasty fatigue among the party\xe2\x80\x99s machers, and all the very human reasons a wealthy, comfortable, relaxed 60-something who last campaigned for office a dozen years ago might decide to pass on the presidential madhouse.'b'These suspicions could still be vindicated; Bush\xe2\x80\x99s recently announced \xe2\x80\x9cexploration\xe2\x80\x9d could end before the first primary vote is cast. But he suddenly looks much more like a full-speed-ahead candidate than I expected, and \xe2\x80\x94 in what counts as clear bad news for Rubio and Christie, among others \xe2\x80\x94 many of the party\xe2\x80\x99s donors and operatives seem 'b'not at all 'b' 'b'deterred'b' by his fraternal connection to a deeply unpopular president.'b'Jeb the serious candidate isn\xe2\x80\x99t Jeb the front-runner, or at least not yet. But his apparent plan to run is a big, important 2016 fact, and one my 2014 columns failed to sufficiently anticipate.'b'2.\xc2\xa0'b'I was too optimistic about the prospects for demilitarizing the police.'b'\xc2\xa0In an 'b'August column'b' during the early days of protest in Ferguson, Mo., I argued that while many reforms to the criminal justice system might come with difficult trade-offs, the case for limiting the flow of heavy weapons \xe2\x80\x94 grenade launchers, armored cars, and so on \xe2\x80\x94 from the military to local police departments was \xe2\x80\x9ceasy, uncomplicated, clear.\xe2\x80\x9d Crime rates keep falling, the threat of terrorism is more marginal than it seemed after 9/11, and there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a justification for giving cops in places like Ferguson the armaments of an occupying force.\xc2\xa0'b'To which I would have been wise to add: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to keep getting weapons anyway.\xe2\x80\x9d The flurry of 'b'congressional interest faded'b' once police unions flexed some muscle. The White House is notionally committed to tougher standards, but 'b'its proposals'b' seem likely to add paperwork without meaningfully reducing the flow of arms.\xc2\xa0'b'Programs in motion tend to stay in motion, that much is always true. But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t foresee that Ferguson itself, initially a story that produced bipartisan sympathy for the protesters, would turn into a weak and polarizing exhibit in the case for policing reform.'b'The persistent rioting made the argument that the cops needed all their gear seem more plausible (though I am not convinced), and the facts of the original tragedy, the shooting of Michael Brown, turned out to make a weaker case against the police than suggested by the initial coverage.\xc2\xa0'b'The hard truth \xe2\x80\x94 which is also on display in New York right now \xe2\x80\x94 is that crime and punishment stir up (for good reason) the strongest of human emotions, which makes achieving consensus on reform slow, hard work. This process can be hastened by particular injustices, but when the facts are bad or complicated, it can just as easily be set back.'b'3. 'b'I gave America\xe2\x80\x99s Ebola countermeasures too little credit.'b' In an'b' October column'b' on the public health fiascos that allowed the deadly virus to infect American health care workers, I wrote that if \xe2\x80\x9cwe manage to contain Ebola domestically, then the president and his appointees will look more competent and levelheaded than their critics.\xe2\x80\x9d But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly confident in that outcome, and so \xe2\x80\x94 worried about a wider outbreak \xe2\x80\x94 I also wrote that \xe2\x80\x9ctravel restrictions increasingly seem like an appropriate hedge against ongoing domestic incompetence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Two months later, there has been no wider outbreak, most of the cases treated domestically have resulted in a cure, and the president and his appointees can reasonably claim vindication. (As can Dr. Paul Farmer, the famous physician-humanitarian, who argued in an October 'b'essay'b' for the London Review of Books that with Western standards of medical treatment, Ebola victims could have a 90 percent survival rate.) So I was too alarmist, often a pundit\xe2\x80\x99s besetting vice.'b'But while pessimism can be an analytic mistake, it\xe2\x80\x99s the happiest way to be wrong. So if infallibility remains out of reach, my hope for 2015 is that my columns will only err in undue pessimism, and that reality will only surprise me \xe2\x80\x94 and you, and all of us \xe2\x80\x94 with good news.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 FACED with a horror like the slaughter of 148 schoolchildren and school staff members by the Taliban in Pakistan, it is tempting to describe the act as \xe2\x80\x9cinhuman\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmedieval.\xe2\x80\x9d What made the massacre particularly chilling, though, is that it was neither. The killings were all too human and of our time.'b'The Peshawar massacre may have been particularly abhorrent, but the 'b'Taliban have attacked at least 1,000 schools'b' over the past five years. They have butchered hundreds through suicide bombings of churches and mosques. And beyond Pakistan lies the brutality of groups like the Islamic State, Boko Haram and the Shabab.'b'What seems to bind these groups together is that they claim to act in the name of Islam. Why, many ask, do so many of today\xe2\x80\x99s most vicious conflicts appear to involve Islamists? And why do Islamist groups seem so much more vicious, sadistic, even evil?'b'Muslims are not the only religious group involved in perpetrating horrors. From Christian 'b'militias in the Central African Republic reportedly eating their foes'b' to 'b'Buddhist monks organizing anti-Muslim pogroms in Myanmar'b', there is cruelty aplenty in the world. Nor are religious believers alone in committing grotesque acts. Yet, critics argue, there appears to be something particularly potent about Islam in fomenting violence, terror and persecution.'b'These are explosive issues and need addressing carefully. The trouble is, this debate remains trapped between bigotry and fear. For many, the actions of groups like the Islamic State or the Taliban merely provide ammunition to promote anti-Muslim hatred.'b'Many liberals, on the other hand, prefer to sidestep the issue by suggesting that the Taliban or the Islamic State do not represent \xe2\x80\x9creal Islam\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a 'b'claim made recently, in so many words, by both President Obama'b' and 'b'David Cameron, the prime minister of Britain'b'. Many argue, too, that the actions of such groups are driven by politics, not religion.'b'Neither claim is credible. A religion is defined not just by its holy texts but also by how believers interpret those texts \xe2\x80\x94 that is, by its practices. The ways in which believers act out their faith define that faith. The fact that Islamist extremists practice their religion in a manner abhorrent to liberals does not make that practice less real.'b'Nor does it make sense to think of the Taliban or the Islamic State as motivated simply by politics, any more than it does to imagine them as purely religious. Radical Islam is the religious form through which a particular kind of barbarous political rage expresses itself.'b'Instead, we need to ask why political rage against the West takes such nihilistic forms today. And why has radical Islam become its principal vehicle?'b'The character of anti-Western sentiment has changed strikingly in recent decades. There is a long history of anti-imperialist movements stretching from the Haitian revolution of the 1790s to the independence movements of the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s in Africa and Asia. While these challenged Western power and often used violent means, they were rarely \xe2\x80\x9canti-Western\xe2\x80\x9d in an essential sense. Indeed, their leaders often embraced revolutionary ideas that came out of the West, self-consciously locating themselves in the tradition of the European Enlightenment.'b'Frantz Fanon, the Martinique-born Algerian nationalist, was one of the most important anticolonial theorists. The aim, he suggested, was not to reject Western ideas, but to reclaim them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll the elements of a solution to the great problems of humanity have, at different times, existed in European thought,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he wrote'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Europeans have not carried out in practice the mission which fell to them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Anti-imperialists of the past saw themselves as part of a wider political project that sought to modernize the non-Western world, politically and economically. Today, however, that wider political project is itself seen as the problem. There is considerable disenchantment with many aspects of modernity, from individualism to globalization, from the breakdown of traditional cultures to the fragmentation of societies, from the blurring of moral boundaries to the seeming soullessness of the contemporary world.'b'In the past, racists often viewed modernity as the property of the West and regarded the non-Western world as incapable of modernizing. Today, it is radicals who often regard modernity as a Western product, and reject both it and the West as tainted goods.'b'The consequence has been the transformation of anti-Western sentiment from a political challenge to imperialist policy to an inchoate rage against modernity. Many strands of contemporary thought, including those embraced by \xe2\x80\x9cdeep greens\xe2\x80\x9d and the far left, express aspects of such discontent. But it is radical Islam that has become the lightning rod for this fury.'b'There are many forms of Islamism, from the Taliban to Hamas, from the Muslim Brotherhood to Boko Haram. What they have in common is a capacity to fuse hostility toward the West with hatred for modernity and, seemingly, to provide an alternative to both. Islamists marry political militancy with a conservative social sensibility, a hostility to globalization with the embrace of a global ummah (the worldwide community of Muslim believers). In so doing, they turn the contradictory aspects of their rage against modernity into a strength.'b'Jihadism provides Islamist ideology with a military form and seemingly creates a global social movement, at a time when radical alternatives have collapsed. What jihadism does not possess is the moral and philosophical framework that guided anti-imperialist movements. Shorn of that framework, and reduced to raging at the world, jihadists have turned terror into an end in itself.'b'The slaughter in Peshawar, like the mass beheadings by the Islamic State, tells us something about the character of contemporary Islam and of Islamism. It tells us even more about the state of contemporary politics, and especially of radical politics.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'Anthony Doerr is a fiction writer living in Boise, Idaho, whose most recent novel is 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll the Light We Cannot See.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b'READING'b' I just started Joseph Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hero With a Thousand Faces,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' his famous argument that all stories are variations on a single story, the monomyth.

I\xe2\x80\x99d shied away from it because some folks, script doctors and the like, have tried to repackage Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s ideas into a one-size-fits-all storytelling formula. But after chewing through 100 pages of Campbell, I\xe2\x80\x99m impressed by its complexity. Watching him perform these staggering acts of synthesis \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99ll toss together, say, Jungian archetype, Sumerian mythology, the Roman Apuleius, shamanism and Lancelot into the space of a few pages \xe2\x80\x94 is breathtaking.'b''b'LISTENING'b' I listen to podcasts while I run in Boise\xe2\x80\x99s foothills.

There\xe2\x80\x99s also something captivating about the voice of the journalist in her conversations with a convicted murderer. They sound like friends; sometimes they seem almost to be flirting. Is he a brilliant sociopath? Or a sympathetic guy in a terrible situation? It is the journalist\xe2\x80\x99s implication in the narrative that compels me \xe2\x80\x94 the storyteller has become part of the story.'b''b'WATCHING'b' My 10-year-old twin sons construct complicated candy dispensers out of 'b'Legos'b', make videos of them, then ritualistically destroy them \xe2\x80\x94 sort of like a 21st-century version of a sand mandala. So I watch those.'b''b'WEARING'b' In my early 20s, a friend and I worked for a few months on a sheep farm in New Zealand.

But the long-term narratives of athletes\xe2\x80\x99 careers compel me even more; how they cope with injuries; how they retain \xe2\x80\x94 or fail to retain \xe2\x80\x94 their identities under unimaginable scrutiny; how they inevitably fall under the wheel of age. Clearly I\xe2\x80\x99ve been reading Joseph Campbell.'b'CAMBRIDGE, Mass. \xe2\x80\x94 SCIENTISTS have often been accused of exaggerating the threat of climate change, but it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming increasingly clear that they ought to be more emphatic about the risk. The year just concluded is about to be declared the hottest one on record, and across the globe climate change is happening faster than scientists predicted.'b'Science is conservative, and new claims of knowledge are greeted with high degrees of skepticism. When Copernicus said the Earth orbited the sun, when Wegener said the continents drifted, and when Darwin said species evolved by natural selection, the burden of proof was on them to show that it was so. In the 18th and 19th centuries, this conservatism generally took the form of a demand for a large amount of evidence; in the 20th century, it took on the form of a demand for statistical significance.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve all heard the slogan \xe2\x80\x9ccorrelation is not causation,\xe2\x80\x9d but that\xe2\x80\x99s a misleading way to think about the issue. It would be better to say that correlation is not necessarily causation, because we need to rule out the possibility that we are just observing a coincidence. Typically, scientists apply a 95 percent confidence limit, meaning that they will accept a causal claim only if they can show that the odds of the relationship\xe2\x80\x99s occurring by chance are no more than one in 20. But it also means that if there\xe2\x80\x99s more than even a scant 5 percent possibility that an event occurred by chance, scientists will reject the causal claim. It\xe2\x80\x99s like not gambling in Las Vegas even though you had a nearly 95 percent chance of winning.'b'Where does this severe standard come from? The 95 percent confidence level is generally credited to the British statistician R. A. Fisher, who was interested in the problem of how to be sure an observed effect of an experiment was not just the result of chance. While there have been enormous arguments among statisticians about what a 95 percent confidence level really means, working scientists routinely use it.'b'But the 95 percent level has no actual basis in nature. It is a convention, a value judgment. The value it reflects is one that says that the worst mistake a scientist can make is to think an effect is real when it is not. This is the familiar \xe2\x80\x9cType 1 error.\xe2\x80\x9d You can think of it as being gullible, fooling yourself, or having undue faith in your own ideas. To avoid it, scientists place the burden of proof on the person making an affirmative claim. But this means that science is prone to \xe2\x80\x9cType 2 errors\xe2\x80\x9d: being too conservative and missing causes and effects that are really there.'b'Is a Type 1 error worse than a Type 2? It depends on your point of view, and on the risks inherent in getting the answer wrong. The fear of the Type 1 error asks us to play dumb; in effect, to start from scratch and act as if we know nothing. That makes sense when we really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on, as in the early stages of a scientific investigation. It also makes sense in a court of law, where we presume innocence to protect ourselves from government tyranny and overzealous prosecutors \xe2\x80\x94 but there are no doubt prosecutors who would argue for a lower standard to protect society from crime.'b'When applied to evaluating environmental hazards, the fear of gullibility can lead us to understate threats. It places the burden of proof on the victim rather than, for example, on the manufacturer of a harmful product. The consequence is that we may fail to protect people who are really getting hurt.'b'And what if we aren\xe2\x80\x99t dumb? What if we have evidence to support a cause-and-effect relationship? Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you know how a particular chemical is harmful; for example, that it has been shown to interfere with cell function in laboratory mice. Then it might be reasonable to accept a lower statistical threshold when examining effects in people, because you already have reason to believe that the observed effect is not just chance.'b'This is what the United States government argued in the case of secondhand smoke. Since bystanders inhaled the same chemicals as smokers, and those chemicals were known to be carcinogenic, it stood to reason that secondhand smoke would be carcinogenic, too. That is why the Environmental Protection Agency accepted a (slightly) lower burden of proof: 90 percent instead of 95 percent.'b'In the case of climate change, we are not dumb at all. We know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, we know that its concentration in the atmosphere has increased by about 40 percent since the industrial revolution, and we know the mechanism by which it warms the planet.'b'WHY don\xe2\x80\x99t scientists pick the standard that is appropriate to the case at hand, instead of adhering to an absolutist one? The answer can be found in a surprising place: the history of science in relation to religion. The 95 percent confidence limit reflects a long tradition in the history of science that valorizes skepticism as an antidote to religious faith.'b'Even as scientists consciously rejected religion as a basis of natural knowledge, they held on to certain cultural presumptions about what kind of person had access to reliable knowledge. One of these presumptions involved the value of ascetic practices. Nowadays scientists do not live monastic lives, but they do practice a form of self-denial, denying themselves the right to believe anything that has not passed very high intellectual hurdles.'b'Moreover, while vigorously denying its relation to religion, modern science retains symbolic vestiges of prophetic tradition, so many scientists bend over backward to avoid these associations. A vast majority of scientists do not speak in public at all, and those who do typically speak in highly guarded, qualified terms. They often refuse to use the language of danger even when danger is precisely what they are talking about.'b'Years ago, climate scientists offered an increase of 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) as the \xe2\x80\x9csafe\xe2\x80\x9d limit or ceiling for the long-term warming of the planet. We are now seeing dangerous effects worldwide, even as we approach a rise of only 1 degree Celsius. The evidence is mounting that scientists have underpredicted the threat. Perhaps this is another reason \xe2\x80\x94 along with our polarized politics and the effect of fossil-fuel lobbying \xe2\x80\x94 we have underreacted to the reality, now unfolding before our eyes, of dangerous climate change.'b'Readers discuss an essay about religious practices that don\xe2\x80\x99t center on a belief in God.'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Religion Without God'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by T.

I find that I am, in many ways, more attuned than ever to the value of my fellow humans, aware of the fears and suffering that draw many to belief. My sense of wonder at the miracle of life has increased, and the notion that the earth is but a tiny place in the infinite universe gives me great comfort.'b'At this time of year, when we reflect on the ideas of salvation and rebirth, I take solace in the lessons of Charles Dickens\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cChristmas Carol.\xe2\x80\x9d His words remind me that it is always possible to live better, to be kinder, to be more generous with my understanding, with the financial rewards that I have reaped, and with my heart.

SHAPIRO'b' Santa Fe, N.M., Dec. 25, 2014'b''b'President Ashraf Ghani of Afghanistan is known for occasionally being hot-tempered. But it was nonetheless baffling to Western diplomats when, in recent days, he abruptly demanded that the United Nations Development Program, the agency that manages hundreds of millions of dollars provided by Western donors to run the police force, 'b'relinquish responsibility for the fund within six months. 'b''b'Mr. Ghani seems to think the Afghan government, despite its history of 'b'endemic corruption'b', could do a better job. He has complained that the agency spends too much on overhead managing the fund, and he seems intent on 'b'moving swiftly to establish himself'b' as a bold, visionary leader. But transferring the fund, known as the Law and Order Trust Fund, would almost certainly make it vulnerable to the kind of theft that has been routine in Afghan ministries over that past decade of war.'b'American taxpayers have much at stake in controversies such as this, as the war enters a new phase. As tempting as it is to think of the Afghan war as receding in the rearview mirror, the United States remains deeply embroiled in the conflict. President Obama'b' celebrated the nominal end 'b'of America\xe2\x80\x99s combat mission last month, vowing, with unfounded optimism, that the country was \xe2\x80\x9cnot going to be a source of terrorist attacks again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'However, his administration opted to 'b'retain significant military operations in Afghanistan'b', where roughly 10,600 troops continue to serve. Washington has also committed to continue spending billions of dollars to keep Afghanistan\xe2\x80\x99s fledgling security forces afloat.'b'The U.N.D.P. is not without critics. In September, the inspector general who oversees American reconstruction funding wrote a letter warning that the agency had failed to address suspected fraud committed by officials at the Afghan Interior Ministry who had taken \xe2\x80\x9cdubious\xe2\x80\x9d deductions from police salaries.'b'Since January 2011, the U.N.D.P. has paid out more than $1.62 billion that has been used largely to cover the salaries and pensions of Afghan police officers. The United States and its allies have contributed more than $3.1 billion to the fund since 2002.'b'Western diplomats say the United Nations agency has done a reasonably good job managing the money in a country where some level of misappropriation is seen as inevitable. Western donors agree that Afghan ministries should eventually assume more responsibility for managing international aid, but the six-month deadline Mr. Ghani has imposed appears unrealistic and arbitrary.'b'Mr. Ghani, a former World Bank executive, understands how donor funds are handled. He has spoken out candidly and forcefully about the need to battle corruption in Afghanistan. What he has yet to do, though, is propose a credible alternative to improve the delivery and spending of Western aid.'b'To accomplish that, Mr. Ghani, who assumed office in September, must first focus on 'b'getting a cabinet in place'b'. Currently, the security ministries are without permanent, empowered leaders.'b'Mr. Ghani also would be wise to begin negotiations that might chart out a reconciliation process with the Taliban, a goal that eluded his predecessor, Hamid Karzai. After years of fighting that have taken an awful toll, most Afghans appear to be supportive of a peace process.'b'A State Department poll conducted in late October found that a growing number of Afghans favor amnesty for Taliban leaders, according to a summary of the findings obtained by The Times, findings that have not been previously disclosed. The poll found that 66 percent of Afghans would be amenable to amnesty for insurgents if it paved the way for a peace deal. Strikingly, 62 percent of women voiced support for that idea, up from 45 percent in 2010.'b'That type of deal, which represents the only hope for truly bringing the Afghan war to a close, will take adroit leadership in Kabul. Mr. Ghani\xe2\x80\x99s desire to oust the U.N.D.P. hastily does not instill much confidence that he is setting the right priorities in a very difficult job.'b'The 'b'human toll'b' of the economic crisis in Greece has been significant: Rates of hunger, suicide and unemployment have increased sharply, thanks to years of misguided austerity policies. So it is hardly shocking that polls are showing that voters are likely to give control of Parliament to the leftist political party Syriza in an election later this month.'b'Whether Syriza can make the lives of average Greeks better is an open question. The party and its charismatic leader, Alexis Tsipras, have promised to renegotiate government debt, cut taxes, reverse pension cuts and increase spending on public services. But to achieve this 'b' ambitious agenda, 'b'Mr. Tsipras will have to persuade leaders of the so-called troika \xe2\x80\x94 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \xe2\x80\x94 to ease the terms of the country\xe2\x80\x99s debt.'b'That will be no easy task. Germany\xe2\x80\x99s finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\xc3\xa4uble, has already declared that the elections will \xe2\x80\x9c'b'change nothing'b'\xe2\x80\x9d about the agreements between Greece and the troika. It is not surprising that Mr. Sch\xc3\xa4uble, who has been one of the biggest proponents of austerity in Europe, is taking such an absolutist position before the election, perhaps in an attempt to sway Greeks away from casting votes for Syriza. But insistence on pummeling Greece does nothing to help that country carry out its reforms faster. The troika leaders need to take a more pragmatic approach \xe2\x80\x94 by, for example, postponing debt repayments that come due next year.'b'In a positive sign, leaders of Syriza have said they want to keep Greece in the euro currency zone. A departure from the monetary union would be highly destructive to the country\xe2\x80\x99s weak economy. And while investors 'b'do not seem as worried'b' about what a Greek exit from the euro might mean for other countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy as they were a few years ago, they do have some concerns.'b'This much is clear: More suffering will not stabilize Greece or allow it to pay off its debts. Its 'b'unemployment rate'b' was 25.5 percent in the third quarter of 2014. That is only modestly lower than the 'b'average rate'b' of 27.5 percent in 2013. Deflation is a reality; consumer prices fell 1.2 percent 'b'in November'b' after a 1.8 percent drop in October. Although the economy is growing again \xe2\x80\x94 'b'gross domestic product'b' increased 0.7 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter \xe2\x80\x94 most people are not seeing improvement in their lives.'b'There is no question that the austerity policies, like cutting spending and raising taxes, that the troika demanded in exchange for helping Greece and other troubled eurozone countries have prolonged and deepened their economic slump. Another major flaw in the troika\xe2\x80\x99s approach was that it left Greece with much more debt than the country could ever hope to repay, something even the I.M.F. 'b'acknowledged last year'b'.'b'The pain caused by these policies is largely to blame for the disillusionment that voters in Greece, Spain, Italy and elsewhere in Europe increasingly feel for mainstream political parties. In Greece, that has benefited Syriza. In Spain, 'b'polls show'b' that Podemos, a leftist party formed less than a year ago, has surged in popularity. And in Italy, the Five Star Movement, which wants that country to leave the euro, has faded recently but 'b'remains popular'b' among a sizable minority of the population.'b'Whether or not Syriza wins a majority of seats in the Greek Parliament, it is clear that voters, constrained by European economic policies, are clamoring for change.'b'Some large hotel chains want to 'b' block'b' guests from using their own wireless Internet devices. It\xe2\x80\x99s a blatant attempt to limit customer choice, and the Federal Communications Commission should say no.'b'Marriott International and the American Hotel and Lodging Association are asking the F.C.C. to give hotels the green light to remotely disable the Wi-Fi devices that some travelers use to connect their laptops and tablet computers to the Internet through cellular services from companies like Verizon. This would force guests to buy the wireless Internet service provided by hotels.'b'In its 'b'petition'b', the hotel industry asks the commission to create an exception to rules that prohibit anyone from \xe2\x80\x9cwillful or malicious interference\xe2\x80\x9d with wireless communications that are \xe2\x80\x9clicensed or authorized\xe2\x80\x9d by the government. The industry asserts that because Wi-Fi signals use unlicensed frequencies, they do not deserve the same protection as licensed services like cellphone networks. That is an absurd argument, since the government has authorized unlicensed Wi-Fi devices and networks.

The commission said the hotel was charging people attending and exhibiting at a conference $250 to $1,000 per device to connect to the hotel-operated Wi-Fi service. Previously, the F.C.C. prohibited Boston\xe2\x80\x99s Logan International Airport from blocking Wi-Fi networks set up by 'b'airline clubs'b'.'b'Hotel industry officials say they want to protect guests from rogue Wi-Fi networks that are designed by criminals to look as though they are part of hotel-operated Wi-Fi systems and that are used to hack into travelers\xe2\x80\x99 computers. They say this issue is a particular worry at conferences where dozens of exhibitors and thousands of visitors are using Wi-Fi.'b'Some of these security concerns have merit. But the best way for hotels to deal with rogue networks is to inform law enforcement agencies and help them apprehend criminals who are trying to steal information. In justifying its request, the industry likens what it wants to do to some universities\xe2\x80\x99 restricting the amount of data that students can send and receive over campus wireless networks. But while universities may restrict the use of their own systems, they generally do not prevent students from setting up and using their own networks.'b'Marriott and the hotel association say that if the commission rules against them, some hotels might prohibit guests from checking in with Wi-Fi devices or restrict such equipment from some parts of their properties, a move that would only alienate their customers. The F.C.C. should not give hotels the power to block Wi-Fi devices that many customers rely on.'b'JEB and Hillary. Hillary and Jeb. It\xe2\x80\x99s getting to the point where a mention of one yields a reference to the other, where they\xe2\x80\x99re semantically inseparable, presidentially conjoined.

It would also call to mind the 2000 race, when that victor\xe2\x80\x99s heir apparent, Al Gore, squared off against another of that loser\xe2\x80\x99s sons, George W. Bush. That too was a Clinton-Bush contest, because Bush campaigned against the incumbent president, repeatedly suggesting that his conduct with a White House intern had brought dishonor to the office.'b'And then, years later, they all somehow got chummy. In an interview with C-Span that aired last January, Barbara Bush revealed that Bill Clinton had developed the habit of dropping by her family\xe2\x80\x99s Kennebunkport, Me., compound every summer for a visit.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love Bill Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, explaining that he and her husband, the 42nd and 41st presidents, had formed a special bond. \xe2\x80\x9cBill\xe2\x80\x99s father wasn\xe2\x80\x99t around, and I think that he thinks of George a little bit like the father he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have.\xe2\x80\x9d If he\xe2\x80\x99s an adopted son of sorts, then Jebary would be incestuous in addition to operatic.'b'How irresistible.'b'But how unlikely, despite all the current speculation following Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s maneuvers to prime a candidacy: the release of emails from his years as governor of Florida; the announcement last week that he\xe2\x80\x99d resigned his positions on the boards of corporations and nonprofit organizations.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that he and Hillary Clinton enjoy enormous structural advantages \xe2\x80\x94 in terms of name recognition, fund-raising and ready-made support networks \xe2\x80\x94 over other potential aspirants for their parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominations.'b'But they also have significant external problems and internal flaws, and there are serious open questions about each.

Too much could go wrong.'b'A successful campaign isn\xe2\x80\x99t just coffers and endorsements, though those matter. It\xe2\x80\x99s narrative and emotion. It\xe2\x80\x99s a speech-by-speech, handshake-by-handshake seduction, and on this score it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear that Clinton and Bush are especially well positioned or masters of the game.

Bush in 2000, and develop that kind of political crush.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re not naturals on the stump. Clinton came into the 2008 campaign with extensive experience in the spotlight; still she struggled to warm up to audiences (and vice versa) and find the looseness and air of intimacy that many voters crave. Her \xe2\x80\x9cHard Choices\xe2\x80\x9d book tour last year was rocky, with awkward moments that she created or should have been able to avoid.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to predict how Bush would fare on the trail, because he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t waged a campaign since his re-election as governor of Florida in 2002. That\xe2\x80\x99s significant, and it\xe2\x80\x99s getting less attention than it should.'b'His bid for the Republican nomination, if he formalizes it, would be his first. And while his brother succeeded on his maiden voyage, the subsequent two nominees, John McCain and Mitt Romney, were making second tries. Practice helps.'b'EVEN Bush\xe2\x80\x99s most ardent admirers don\xe2\x80\x99t sell him as a rousing orator. Last April I happened to hear him give an education reform speech, at an event where Chris Christie had been the headliner the previous year, and the contrast was stark. Christie had come across as impassioned, unscripted. He filled and held the room. Bush was a phlegmatic blur. Afterward his supporters talked about and fretted over it.'b'Both he and Hillary Clinton may be 'b'too'b' awash in money. More so than other Democrats and Republicans who\xe2\x80\x99ve signaled interest in the presidency, they\xe2\x80\x99ve existed for many years now at a financial altitude far, far above that of ordinary Americans.'b'And reporters digging into their affairs would provide voters with constant reminders of that, revisiting the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 speaking fees and examining Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s adventures in private equity, which a 'b'Bloomberg Politics'b' story from December described under this headline: \xe2\x80\x9cJeb Bush Has a Mitt Romney Problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to fathom that at this of all junctures, when there\xe2\x80\x99s growing concern about income inequality and the attainability of the American dream, voters in both parties would choose nominees of such economically regal bearing.'b'Clinton would at least hold the promise of history in the making \xe2\x80\x94 a first female president \xe2\x80\x94 and her candidacy would wring excitement from that. But to seal the deal, she\xe2\x80\x99d probably have to tamp down excessive talk of inevitability, forge a less combative relationship with the news media and find a nimbleness that has often eluded her.'b'As Peter Beinart observed in a 'b'National Journal'b' appraisal last year, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s terrific at developing and executing a well-defined plan. She\xe2\x80\x99s less adept at realizing that a well-defined plan is not working and improvising something new.\xe2\x80\x9d He was previewing a Clinton presidency, but his assessment is equally germane to a Clinton candidacy.'b'And Clinton and Bush together have more baggage than the cargo hold of a 747. That\xe2\x80\x99s the flip side of all of those family tentacles, all that political history, all those privileged inside glimpses of the process. They make you putty in the hands of the right opposition researcher.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re nearly two years away from November 2016. So are Clinton and Bush. They remain abstractions.'b'But they won\xe2\x80\x99t get to campaign that way, and we won\xe2\x80\x99t know some of the most important stuff about them until they\xe2\x80\x99re actually in the arena, showing us their fettle and whether it fits the mood of the moment.'b'Maybe Jebary really is who we are and where we\xe2\x80\x99re headed. I suspect a different destination.'b'MANY of my friends were shocked some years ago when I cut down on my junk-food intake. Even my wise old physician was a little put out. He had more or less given me the green light to the \xe2\x80\x9cgolden arches\xe2\x80\x9d a few years before when, one afternoon, following my annual checkup, he\xe2\x80\x99d asked me what I consumed every day. \xe2\x80\x9cA Big Mac, medium fries and Coke for lunch,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, \xe2\x80\x9cand frozen pizza from the convenience store for dinner.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, since my blood test numbers were more or less O.K., \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d recommend you keep on with the junk food.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I did, gleefully, for a while. But at some point \xe2\x80\x94 maybe around the middle of my fifth decade \xe2\x80\x94 my Happy Meals began to leave me feeling a little less than exuberant. They sat inside my stomach, wobbling, even as I somehow felt more empty than before I had devoured them. Finally, flush with pride, I put most burgers and fries behind me.'b'When I went to my doctor the following year, I could not wait to tell him how I\xe2\x80\x99d mended my ways.'b'Sitting in his reception room, however, I needed something to munch on. I reached for the nearest magazine and gobbled down details of Monica Lewinsky\xe2\x80\x99s secret life. I picked up a report on the news from Bosnia, then noticed that there was a far spicier update on Winona Ryder\xe2\x80\x99s sticky fingers. When the time for my appointment came, I could hardly tear myself from all the savory nibbles. And when I told my doctor about my new regime, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem impressed.'b'A few years later, my wise old physician retired, and was replaced by a doctor two years younger than myself. He was friendly and relaxed and had lots of numbers at his fingertips. As I grew older, he told me, I needed to be more proactive in my health routine.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou should go to the gym,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I hardly even visit KFC anymore!\xe2\x80\x9d I protested.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting triathlons. You\xe2\x80\x99ve simply reached the age when you need to get your heart going,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly three times a week, 30 minutes on a treadmill.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t keen to do this, but he had my new (mysteriously higher) cholesterol figures in his hands, engraved diplomas on his walls. Reluctantly, I signed on at a local health club. Soon my time there became a highlight of my day. The huffing and puffing left me at once calmer and invigorated. I felt even better than when renouncing nachos with extra cheese.'b'I proudly reported this breakthrough to a quiet, slightly older friend. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve never thought of doing this with your mind?\xe2\x80\x9d he said, a bit ungraciously, I thought. \xe2\x80\x9cJust sitting still for a few minutes every day, to give your imagination a chance to take a walk?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have time!\xe2\x80\x9d I replied. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially now that I\xe2\x80\x99m devoting 75 minutes to the gym.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not the type to meditate; I\xe2\x80\x99d sooner give up Taco Bell for life than take on the rigorous disciplines of yoga or tai chi. But I recalled something a 17th-century mathematician and philosopher had whispered to me, which echoed what my friend now said. We run and run in search of contentment, Pascal wrote in his \xe2\x80\x9cPens\xc3\xa9es,\xe2\x80\x9d and so ensure we\xe2\x80\x99ll never be settled or content. We mindlessly race away from the one place where happiness is to be found.'b'I was, in short, what I\xe2\x80\x99d call an externalist \xe2\x80\x94 a person who\xe2\x80\x99ll exercise great care over what he puts into his body and never think about what he puts into his mind. Who will dwell at length on everything he can see, in order to distract himself from the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s everything he can\xe2\x80\x99t see on which his well-being depends. Who will fill his head with so much junk that he can\xe2\x80\x99t remember that wolfing down Buffalo wings is not the problem, but a symptom.'b'An externalist makes a point \xe2\x80\x94 even a habit \xe2\x80\x94 of cherishing means over ends, effects over causes and everything that fills him up over everything that truly sustains him. He interprets health in terms of his body weight, wealth in terms of his bank account and success in terms of his business card. He\xe2\x80\x99ll go to the health club, and never think of the mental health club, like someone who imagines the only arteries to be unclogged are the ones that course with blood.'b'This past Christmas, I was all set to take myself on an exotic vacation, and then decided just to stay in my mother\xe2\x80\x99s house in California \xe2\x80\x94 no long lines, no visas, no three-hour online reservation attempts foiled when you forget your second password. I\xe2\x80\x99d come to believe that most destinations are less important than the spirit you bring to them. And that spirit is better developed by sitting still than by running all around.'b'As friends hurried off to the airport for Rio or Hawaii, I sat in my little room and watched the sun burn on the water down below. Light flooded into the space every afternoon and then, in the magic hour, the whole place began to glow. I nibbled at breakfast bars and listened to public radio and did nothing at all, the way it isn\xe2\x80\x99t always easy to do if you\xe2\x80\x99ve paid half your annual income to go to Mauritius. Moments carried a depth, a weight, of both emotion and association, they\xe2\x80\x99d seldom have in Vegas. It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much that we lack food, I remembered Simone Weil suggesting, as that we won\xe2\x80\x99t acknowledge that we\xe2\x80\x99re hungry.'b'The external world is always going to be my home, of course, and a place where I find each day\xe2\x80\x99s savor and delight. And with Google Glass and Dreamliners and every hour\xe2\x80\x99s new wearable, it becomes ever more like a supermarket, restocked each day with ever more astonishing options. Revisiting North Korea, four months ago, I was reminded of just how lucky I am, when it comes to choice and opportunity.'b'The only problem with such visible bounty, though, is that it becomes ever easier to feel, within yourself, like a gridlocked freeway at rush hour with no overpasses or offramps in sight. You start railing against fascism, as W. H. Auden suggested, and become a dictator at the family dinner table. You hold forth against the destruction of the environment and never notice \xe2\x80\x94 or try to clear \xe2\x80\x94 the hazy skies and deforested spaces within you.'b'I still surrender \xe2\x80\x94 gratefully \xe2\x80\x94 to the latest congressional sex scandal or celebrity memoir whenever I\xe2\x80\x99m killing time waiting for a plane, even though I know that any book by D. H. Lawrence or Marcel Proust will leave me feeling more alive, more myself, more in love with the world. And even as I keep my distance from McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s now, I have no hesitation in racing off toward organic, locally sourced, \xe2\x80\x9cfood with integrity\xe2\x80\x9d Chipotle outlets instead. A life of daily visits to the gym demands some guilty pleasures.'b'But I know that one day my doctor is going to come into the room with a very dark look on his face and news that no treadmill or repudiation of onion rings is going to make better. And then the only thing I\xe2\x80\x99ll have to turn to will be all I\xe2\x80\x99ve done when going nowhere \xe2\x80\x94 and everything I might have stored in some less visible account.'b'THE new Congress that starts work this week is the latest reminder of America\xe2\x80\x99s stark political divisions: The parties in Washington are more polarized than they have been in decades, the partisanship gap between rural Republicans and urban Democrats has grown, and the battle for suburban voters keeps intensifying. Much less is said, however, about the equally significant economic division between conservative \xe2\x80\x9cred states\xe2\x80\x9d and liberal \xe2\x80\x9cblue states.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Blue states, like California, New York and Illinois, whose economies turn on finance, trade and knowledge, are generally richer than red states. But red states, like Texas, Georgia and Utah, have done a better job over all of offering a higher standard of living relative to housing costs. That basic economic fact not only helps explain why the nation\xe2\x80\x99s electoral map got so much redder in the November midterm elections, but also why America\xe2\x80\x99s prosperity is in jeopardy.'b'Red state economies based on energy extraction, agriculture and suburban sprawl may have lower wages, higher poverty rates and lower levels of education on average than those of blue states \xe2\x80\x94 but their residents also benefit from much lower costs of living. For a middle-class person , the American dream of a big house with a backyard and a couple of cars is much more achievable in low-tax Arizona than in deep-blue Massachusetts. As Jed Kolko, chief economist of Trulia, recently noted, housing costs almost twice as much in deep-blue markets ($227 per square foot) than in red markets ($119).'b'Driven by oil, the fracking boom and exurban sprawl, many of the red state economies are experiencing a vigorous (if ultimately unsustainable) spurt of growth. Thanks to loose land-use regulations and low labor costs, detached, single-family homes can be churned out quite cheaply, generating more middle-wage, low-skill jobs. And since red states spend less per capita on education, infrastructure and social welfare than their blue state counterparts (and many of them receive more federal dollars than they contribute), their tax burdens are lower, too.'b'To the surprise of many, voters in four red states \xe2\x80\x94 Alaska, Nebraska, South Dakota and Arkansas \xe2\x80\x94 supported referendums in November to raise their state minimum wage. And not just by a little. Controlling for the cost of living, they will have wage floors that are higher than those of many blue states. Once Obamacare is factored in, voters in these states ironically benefit from a somewhat strengthened social safety net, even though it is one that their elected politicians mainly oppose and that is heavily subsidized by blue state tax dollars.'b'For blue state urbanites who toil in low-paying retail, food preparation and service jobs, for the journeyman tradespeople who once formed the heart of the middle class, for teachers, civil servants, students and young families, the American dream of homeownership \xe2\x80\x94 or even an affordable rental apartment \xe2\x80\x94 is increasingly out of reach. Adding insult to injury, rapid gentrification in these larger knowledge hubs brings the constant threat of displacement of creative workers. For even the much better paid techies, engineers, financiers and managers who are displacing them, the metropolitan version of the American dream is a cramped condo or a small house and a long commute. Many are opting to move to cheaper red states instead, further driving their growth.'b'Inequality has grown fastest over the past three decades in larger states with more vibrant knowledge economies, like Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. In 1979, the most unequal states were poor conservative states \xe2\x80\x94 Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama and Georgia. By 2012, New York, Connecticut, California and Massachusetts joined Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Tennessee among the 10 most unequal states.'b'Blue state knowledge economies are also extremely expensive to operate. Their innovative edge turns on a high-cost infrastructure of research universities and knowledge institutions \xe2\x80\x94 a portion of which demand public subsidy. Their size and density require expensive subway and transit systems to move people around. Blue state cities like New York and San Francisco are booming, but they are hampered by potholes and crumbling infrastructure, troubled public school systems, growing inequality and housing unaffordability, and entrenched poor populations, all of which mean higher public costs and higher tax burdens.'b'And yet for all that, they are pioneering the new economic order that will determine our future \xe2\x80\x94 one that turns on innovation and knowledge rather than the raw production of goods.'b'Despite their longstanding divisions, red state and blue state economies depend crucially on one another. Just as Alexander Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s merchant cities ate and exported the harvests of Thomas Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s yeomen farmers, and New England textile mills wove slave-harvested cotton, blue state knowledge economies run on red state energy. Red state energy economies in their turn depend on dense coastal cities and metro areas, not just as markets and sources of migrants, but for the technology and talent they supply.'b'Of course, while Massachusetts and Mississippi represent the extremes of America\xe2\x80\x99s politico-economic divide, there are many red states like Utah, Arizona and Texas that are growing their tech and knowledge economies, and a number of historically blue states like Pennsylvania that have benefited from the fracking boom. But in our increasingly competitive global economy, long-term prosperity turns on knowledge, education and innovation. The idea that the red states can enjoy the benefits provided by the blue states without helping to pay for them (and while poaching their industries with the promise of low taxes and regulations) is as irresponsible and destructive of our national future as it is hypocritical.'b'But that is exactly the mantra of the growing ranks of red state politicos. Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, a likely 2016 G.O.P. presidential candidate, has taken to bragging that his state\xe2\x80\x99s low-frills development strategy provides a model for the nation as a whole. But fracking and sprawling your way to growth aren\xe2\x80\x99t a sustainable national economic strategy.'b'The allure of cheap growth has handed the red states a distinct political advantage. Their economic system may be outmoded and obsolete, but it is strong enough to blight the future. The Democrats may be able to draw on the country\xe2\x80\x99s growing demographic diversity and the liberal leanings of younger voters to win the presidency from time to time, but the real power dynamic is red.'b'As long as the highly gerrymandered red states can keep on delivering the economic goods to their voters, concerted federal action on transportation, infrastructure, sustainability, education, a rational immigration policy and a strengthened social safety net will remain out of reach. These are investments that the future prosperity of the nation, in red states and blue states alike, requires.'b'Heightened partisan rancor is the least of our problems. The red state-blue state divide threatens to kill the real American dream.'b'The year has barely begun and the economy is drying up fast.'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael, a Jewish republic?\xe2\x80\x9d (Opinion, Dec. 26): When Kai Bird writes that American Jews\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crelation to the state of Israel is precisely the same as that of Irish-Americans to Ireland, or Italian-Americans to Italy,\xe2\x80\x9d he is not only wrong regarding the facts but misguided in the conclusions he draws both about Israel and American Jews.'b'Unlike the mass migrations of the Irish and Italians who came to America in the 19th and early 20th centuries to escape famine and poverty and never looked back, American Jews, after migrating to the United States for similar reasons at the same time but also for religious freedom, understood with Jews everywhere that the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 has been the most remarkable achievement of the Jewish people in 2,000 years as well as one of the great feats of history.'b'This is why they find the calls on them to turn their backs on their brethren in Israel, who bear the burden and pay the price for the continued existence of the Jewish state, so difficult to heed, despite their discomfort that policies pursued by the current Israeli government are leading it into a dark corner.'b'And this is also why Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnation-state\xe2\x80\x9d bill \xe2\x80\x94 which calls upon Jews, not only in Israel but also by inference in the United States, to eschew democratic principles to pursue a quasi religious-national identity at the expense of universal principles \xe2\x80\x94 could be the measure that breaks the mystic bonds of common identity across the centuries that has given purpose to the Jewish experience.'b''b'Edward Abrahams, Washington'b''b'Mr. Bird fails to make a necessary distinction between a legislative initiative to declare Israel a Jewish state, which may send a wrong message to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Arab citizens, and the need to get the Palestinians to recognize Israel as a Jewish state, a vital step in ending the decades-old conflict. Defining exactly what a Jewish state means is an age-old issue in Israel. But Israelis have understood since the creation of Israel in 1948, as embodied in the declaration of independence, that Israel is a Jewish and democratic state. Legislation is unnecessary to reiterate the Jewishness of Israel. On the other hand, the core of the conflict with the Palestinians for six decades has been the Palestinian refusal to accept the legitimacy of a Jewish state in the land of Israel. If there is ever to be peace, Palestinians must make the qualitative leap toward accepting a Jewish state. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t happened yet and must be part of any negotiations.'b''b'Abraham H.

Over a year, she had seen five other physicians for a \xe2\x80\x9crapid heartbeat\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling stressed.\xe2\x80\x9d After extensive testing, she had finally been referred for psychological counseling for an anxiety disorder.'b'The careful history Dr. Martin took revealed that Betsy was taking an over-the-counter weight loss product that contained ephedrine. (I have changed their names for privacy\xe2\x80\x99s sake.) When she stopped taking the remedy, her symptoms also stopped. Asked why she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t mentioned this information before, she said she\xe2\x80\x99d \xe2\x80\x9cnever been asked.\xe2\x80\x9d Until then, her providers would sooner order tests than take the time to talk with her about the problem.'b'Betsy\xe2\x80\x99s case was fortunate; poor communication often has much worse consequences. A review of reports by the Joint Commission, a nonprofit that provides accreditation to health care organizations, found that communication failure (rather than a provider\xe2\x80\x99s lack of technical skill) was at the root of over 70 percent of serious adverse health outcomes in hospitals.'b'A doctor\xe2\x80\x99s ability to explain, listen and empathize has a profound impact on a patient\xe2\x80\x99s care. Yet, as one survey found, two out of every three patients are discharged from the hospital without even knowing their diagnosis. Another study discovered that in over 60 percent of cases, patients misunderstood directions after a visit to their doctor\xe2\x80\x99s office. And on average, physicians wait just 18 seconds before interrupting patients\xe2\x80\x99 narratives of their symptoms. Evidently, we have a long way to go.'b'Three years ago, my colleagues and I started a program in Harrisburg designed to improve doctors\xe2\x80\x99 communication with their patients. This large urban hospital system serves a city with a population of about 50,000, together with the surrounding metropolitan area of more than 550,000 people.'b'The hospital faces particular challenges: The city has a high poverty rate (32 percent, compared with the state average of 13 percent), and 'b'the metro area has a high rate of childhood obesity'b'. Over all, nearly a third of people around Harrisburg are uninsured, compared with about one in 10 for the rest of Pennsylvania.'b'Our project started with a simple baseline assessment of how we as doctors communicated with our patients. Observation soon revealed that physicians introduced themselves on only about one in four occasions. And without an introduction, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that patients could correctly identify their physician only about a quarter of the time.'b'Brief, rushed physician encounters were common, with limited opportunity for questions. A lack of empathy was often apparent: In one instance, after a tearful patient had related the recent death of a loved one, the physician\xe2\x80\x99s next sentence was: \xe2\x80\x9cHow is your abdominal pain?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We developed a physician-training program, which involved mock patient interviews and assessment from the actor role-playing the patient. Over 250 physicians were trained using this technique. We also arranged for a \xe2\x80\x9cphysician coach\xe2\x80\x9d to sit in on real patient interviews and provide feedback.'b'Over the next two years, patient satisfaction with doctors, as measured by a standard questionnaire, moved the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s predicted score up in national rankings by a remarkable 40 percentile points. Several studies have found a correlation between higher patient satisfaction scores and better health outcomes. In one, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, Harvard health policy researchers reported that higher patient satisfaction was associated with improved outcomes for several diseases, including heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia.'b'The need to train and test physicians in \xe2\x80\x9cinterpersonal and communication skills\xe2\x80\x9d was formally recognized only relatively recently, in 1999, when the American Board of Medical Specialties made them one of physicians\xe2\x80\x99 key competencies. Although medical schools and residency programs then began to train and test students on these skills, once physicians have completed training, they are seldom evaluated on them. And doctors trained before the mid-1990s have rarely, if ever, been evaluated at all.'b'I realize that many colleagues may see methods like ours as too intrusive on their clinical practice and may say that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have the time. But we need to move away from the perception that social skills and better communication are a kind of optional extra for doctors. A good bedside manner is simply good medicine.'b'A passionate diabetes specialist told me how she sat down with a patient to understand why he was not using his diabetes medications regularly, despite numerous hospital admissions for complications.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t continue to do this anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her, on the verge of tears. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve just given up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She placed a hand on his shoulder and just sat with him. After a pause, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a heart that still beats, and legs you can still walk on \xe2\x80\x94 many of my patients don\xe2\x80\x99t have that privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Five years later, recalling this episode, her patient credits her with inspiring him to take better care of himself. The entire encounter took less than five minutes.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 THE president of the 'b'Palestinian Authority'b', 'b'Mahmoud Abbas'b', insists on using international institutions to pressure 'b'Israel'b', even after he was rebuffed in the 'b'United Nations Security Council'b', where he sought a resolution mandating Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Mr. Abbas has now announced that he will turn to the 'b'International Criminal Court'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a move that will produce 'b'Palestinian'b' charges and Israeli countercharges but not alter the reality on the ground.'b'A European official I met recently expressed sympathy for the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 pursuit of a Security Council resolution. I responded by saying that if he favors Palestinian statehood, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to stop giving the Palestinians a pass. It is time to make it costly for them to focus on symbols rather than substance.'b'Since 2000, there have been three serious negotiations that culminated in offers to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict: Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s parameters in 2000, former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\xe2\x80\x99s offer in 2008, and Secretary of State John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s efforts last year. In each case, a proposal on all the core issues was made to Palestinian leaders and the answer was either \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d or no response. They determined that the cost of saying \xe2\x80\x9cyes,\xe2\x80\x9d or even of making a counteroffer that required concessions, was too high.'b'Palestinian political culture is rooted in a narrative of injustice; its anticolonialist bent and its deep sense of grievance treats concessions to Israel as illegitimate. Compromise is portrayed as betrayal, and negotiations \xe2\x80\x94 which are by definition about mutual concessions \xe2\x80\x94 will inevitably force any Palestinian leader to challenge his people by making a politically costly decision.'b'But going to the 'b'United Nations'b' does no such thing. It puts pressure on Israel and requires nothing of the Palestinians. Resolutions are typically about what Israel must do and what Palestinians should get. If saying yes is costly and doing nothing isn\xe2\x80\x99t, why should we expect the Palestinians to change course?'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why European leaders who fervently support Palestinian statehood must focus on how to raise the cost of saying no or not acting at all when there is an offer on the table. Palestinians care deeply about international support for their cause. If they knew they would be held accountable for being nonresponsive or rejecting a fair offer or resolution, it could well change their calculus.'b'Unfortunately, most Europeans are focused far more on Israeli behavior and want, at a minimum, to see Israel\xe2\x80\x99s continuing settlement policy change.'b'But turning to the United Nations or the International Criminal Court during an Israeli election is counterproductive. It will be seen in Israel as a one-sided approach, and it will strengthen politicians who prefer the status quo. These candidates will argue that the deck is stacked against Israel and that the country needs leaders who will stand firm against unfair pressure.'b'Why not wait? If a new Israeli government after the elections is prepared to take a peace initiative and build settlements only on land that is likely to be part of Israel and not part of Palestine, there will be no need for a United Nations resolution.'b'If not, and the Europeans decide to pursue one, it must be balanced. It cannot simply address Palestinian needs by offering borders based on the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps and a capital in Arab East Jerusalem without offering something equally specific to Israel \xe2\x80\x94 namely, security arrangements that leave Israel able to defend itself by itself, phased withdrawal tied to the Palestinian Authority\xe2\x80\x99s performance on security and governance, and a resolution of the Palestinian refugee issue that allows Israel to retain its Jewish character.'b'In all likelihood the Palestinians would reject such a resolution. Accepting it would require compromises that they refused in 2000, 2008 and 2014. There is, of course, no guarantee that the next Israeli government would accept such a resolution. But the Israelis are not the ones pushing for United Nations involvement. The Palestinians are. And if their approach is neither about two states nor peace, there ought to be a price for that.'b'Peace requires accountability on both sides. It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to ask the Israelis to accept the basic elements that make peace possible \xe2\x80\x94 1967 lines as well as land swaps and settlement building limited to the blocks. But isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to demand the equivalent from the Palestinians on two states for two peoples, and on Israeli security? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it time to ask the Palestinians to respond to proposals and accept resolutions that address Israeli needs and not just their own?'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 Desperation Move'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 1), about Palestinian efforts to get United Nations support for statehood and to join the International Criminal Court:'b'I am distressed that you are asking the Palestinian leadership to postpone any diplomatic initiative to restore Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 rights until after the Israeli elections.

Would this episode have ended this way if the shooter had been male, or black, or both?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s an unanswerable question, but nevertheless one that deserves pondering. Every case is different. Police officers are human beings making split-second decisions \xe2\x80\x94 often informed by fears \xe2\x80\x94 about when to use force and the degree of that force.'b'But that truth is also the trap. How and why are our fears constructed and activated? The American mind has been poisoned, from this country\xe2\x80\x99s birth, against minority populations. People of color, particularly African-American men, have been caught up in a twister of macroaggressions and micro ones.

Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t more people, in equal measures, be taken in and not taken out?'b'Why weren\xe2\x80\x99t these black men, any of them, the recipients of the same use of force \xe2\x80\x94 or lack thereof \xe2\x80\x94 as Julia Shields?'b'Suddenly, or so it seems, the U.S. economy is looking better.

But is this time different?'b'To understand why economists usually downplay the economic role of presidents, let\xe2\x80\x99s revisit a much-mythologized episode in U.S. economic history: the recession and recovery of the 1980s.'b'On the right, of course, the 1980s are remembered as an age of miracles wrought by the blessed Reagan, who cut taxes, conjured up the magic of the marketplace and led the nation to job gains never matched before or since. In reality, the 16 million 'b'jobs America added'b' during the Reagan years were only slightly more than the 14 million added over the previous eight years. And a later president \xe2\x80\x94 Bill something-or-other \xe2\x80\x94 presided over the creation of 22 million jobs. But who\xe2\x80\x99s counting?'b'In any case, however, serious analyses of the Reagan-era business cycle place very little weight on Reagan, and emphasize instead the role of the Federal Reserve, which sets monetary policy and is largely independent of the political process. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Fed, under the leadership of Paul Volcker, was determined to bring inflation down, even at a heavy price; it tightened policy, sending interest rates sky high, with 'b'mortgage rates'b' going above 18 percent. What followed was a severe recession that drove unemployment to double digits but also broke the wage-price spiral.'b'Then the Fed decided that America had suffered enough. It loosened the reins, sending interest rates plummeting and 'b'housing starts'b' soaring. And the economy bounced back. Reagan got the political credit for \xe2\x80\x9cmorning in America,\xe2\x80\x9d but Mr. Volcker was actually responsible for both the slump and the boom.'b'The point is that normally the Fed, not the White House, rules the economy. Should we apply the same rule to the Obama years?'b'Not quite.'b'For one thing, the Fed has had a hard time gaining traction in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, because the aftermath of a huge housing and mortgage bubble has left private spending relatively unresponsive to interest rates. This time around, monetary policy really needed help from a temporary increase in government spending, which meant that the president could have made a big difference. And he did, for a while; politically, the Obama stimulus may have been a failure, but an overwhelming majority of economists believe that it 'b'helped mitigate the slump'b'.'b'Since then, however, scorched-earth Republican opposition has more than reversed that initial effort. In fact, 'b'federal spending'b' adjusted for inflation and population growth is lower now than it was when Mr. Obama took office; at the same point in the Reagan years, it was up more than 20 percent. So much, then, for fiscal policy.'b'There is, however, another sense in which Mr. Obama has arguably made a big difference. The Fed has had a hard time getting traction, but it has at least made an effort to boost the economy \xe2\x80\x94 and it has done so despite ferocious attacks from conservatives, who have accused it again and again of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'debasing the dollar'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and setting the stage for runaway inflation. Without Mr. Obama to shield its independence, the Fed might well have been bullied into raising interest rates, which would have been disastrous. So the president has indirectly aided the economy by helping to fend off the hard-money mob.'b'Last but not least, even if you think Mr. Obama deserves little or no credit for good economic news, the fact is his opponents have spent years claiming that his bad attitude \xe2\x80\x94 he has been known to suggest, now and then, that some bankers have behaved badly \xe2\x80\x94 is somehow responsible for the economy\xe2\x80\x99s weakness. Now that he\xe2\x80\x99s presiding over unexpected economic strength, they can\xe2\x80\x99t just turn around and assert his irrelevance.'b'So is the president responsible for the accelerating recovery? No. Can we nonetheless say that we\xe2\x80\x99re doing better than we would be if the other party held the White House? Yes. Do those who were blaming Mr. Obama for all our economic ills now look like knaves and fools? Yes, they do. And that\xe2\x80\x99s because they are.'b'For most people, Ferguson, Mo., will be remembered for one awful August afternoon, when a white police officer there shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown.'b'But that incident was only a snapshot in the town\xe2\x80\x99s long and complicated racial history \xe2\x80\x94 a history 'b'characterized by'b' entrenched segregation and economic inequality, as well as by familiar and systemic obstacles that have kept black residents from holding positions of political power.'b'Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s population is 'b'two-thirds African-American'b', and yet its mayor, city manager and 'b'five of its six'b' City Council members are white. So are its police chief and all but three officers on its 53-member police force.'b'The school board for the Ferguson-Florissant School District is much the same: More than three-quarters of the district\xe2\x80\x99s 12,000 students are black, but the 'b'seven-member board'b' includes only one African-American.'b'Last month the American Civil Liberties Union 'b'sued'b' the school board under the Voting Rights Act, arguing that the way its members are elected blocks minority voters from fully participating in the political process.'b'The method is known as \xe2\x80\x9cat large\xe2\x80\x9d voting, and lets voters cast ballots for all candidates in the district, regardless of where the voters live. Since the district\xe2\x80\x99s voting-age population is 50 percent white and 47 percent black, and since both groups there tend to vote along strict racial lines, the white voters\xe2\x80\x99 candidates almost always win.'b'The lawsuit, filed in a Missouri federal court on Dec. 18, 'b'contends'b' that the white board members have not been attentive enough to the needs of black students, and in 2013 the board dismissed the district\xe2\x80\x99s first black superintendent without explanation.'b'The suit calls for at-large voting to be replaced with another system, like one that allows residents to vote for a candidate who lives in their part of the district, which would make it possible for majority-black neighborhoods to elect board members of their choice.'b'At-large voting is not necessarily discriminatory, but it has long been one of 'b'the most common tools'b' for reducing minority voting power. It is also by far the most common ground for successful claims under the Voting Rights Act, and courts have repeatedly 'b'struck down'b' at-large voting schemes around the country where plaintiffs have shown that, when combined with racial polarization, they weaken minority voters.'b'In 1982, the Supreme Court 'b'explained'b' that minority voting power \xe2\x80\x9cis particularly diluted when bloc voting occurs and ballots are cast along strict majority-minority lines.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the case in the Ferguson-Florissant School District, where blacks and whites also live in extreme geographical and economic segregation. (The St. Louis metropolitan region as a whole is 'b'among the most racially segregated'b' in the nation.)'b'There are other solutions to the problem of racial polarization. Alternative vote-counting methods \xe2\x80\x94 like 'b'cumulative or choice voting'b' \xe2\x80\x94 may do a better job of giving minorities a voice, especially as redistricting efforts grow more sophisticated. And more municipalities are 'b'starting to realize'b' on their own that there is not much to gain by defending at-large election systems.'b'The bottom line is that while democratic elections will always favor majorities, they must also protect the interests of minority populations of all kinds \xe2\x80\x94 and give them an equal opportunity to elect the candidates they choose.'b'In January 1992, Bill Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, left the presidential campaign trail to fly home for the execution of a man named Ricky Ray Rector. Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to grant clemency to Mr. Rector, who had been sentenced to death for killing a police officer, was 'b'widely seen'b' as an attempt to fend off the familiar charge that Democrats were soft on crime.'b'On Dec. 31, Gov. Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley of Maryland, whose name has been mentioned among potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates, 'b'commuted'b' the sentences of the last four inmates on the state\xe2\x80\x99s death row.'b'Maryland 'b'abolished'b' the death penalty in 2013, but only for new sentences. In resentencing the condemned men to life without parole, Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley 'b'said'b' that leaving their death sentences in place would \xe2\x80\x9cnot serve the public good of the people of Maryland \xe2\x80\x94 present or future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whether or not Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley runs for president, his action is a mark of how quickly the death penalty debate in America has shifted. 'b'Liberals'b' have long opposed capital punishment, and now more conservatives are 'b'speaking out against it'b' as well, variously describing it as 'b'immoral'b', 'b'unjust'b', 'b'racist'b', 'b'arbitrary'b', 'b'costly'b' and 'b'ineptly carried out'b'.'b'Thirty-five people were put to death in 2014, the fewest in 20 years, 'b'according to'b' a report last month by the Death Penalty Information Center. All but seven of the executions took place in three states: Texas, Missouri and Florida. And while two-thirds of those executed were black, only six had been convicted of killing a black person, even though blacks make up almost half of all murder victims.'b'Another sign of the times: Fewer people are put on death row. There were 72 new death sentences in 2014, the lowest number since 1974.'b'In various decisions, the Supreme Court has helped to reduce these numbers, barring the execution of the 'b'mentally ill'b', the 'b'intellectually disabled'b' and those who were 'b'minors at the time of their crimes'b'. But states have found ways around those rulings, and have executed many people who fall into one or more of these categories \xe2\x80\x94 people like 'b'John Errol Ferguson'b', who was schizophrenic and sat on Florida\xe2\x80\x99s death row for 34 years before he was executed in 2013, and 'b'Marvin Wilson'b', who had an I.Q. of 61 and was executed in Texas in 2012.'b'A 'b'study'b' published last June in the Hastings Law Journal found that of the last 100 people to be put to death, one-third had evidence of an intellectual disability, borderline intellectual functioning or a traumatic brain injury. At least 20 others were diagnosed with or showed symptoms of mental illness, such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Others had experienced severe trauma in childhood.'b'In other words, while the death penalty may be increasingly infrequent, it is all too often a brutal end to a brutal life. The people executed in recent years were not the \xe2\x80\x9cworst of the worst\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 as many death-penalty advocates like to imagine \xe2\x80\x94 but those who were too poor, mentally ill or disabled to avoid it.'b'In 2014, for the first time, a 'b'Washington Post-ABC News poll'b' found that a majority of Americans favored life without parole over the death penalty. Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Malley\xe2\x80\x99s move may seem unusual among politicians, but it reflects the views of a growing segment of the country.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming State of the State address is expected to focus on what can be done to improve public education across the state.'b'If he is serious about the issue, he will have to move beyond peripheral concerns and political score-settling with the state teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union, which did not support his re-election, and go to the heart of the matter. And that means confronting and proposing remedies for the racial and economic segregation that has gripped the state\xe2\x80\x99s schools, as well as the inequality in school funding that prevents many poor districts from lifting their children up to state standards.'b'These shameful inequities were fully brought to light in 2006, when the state\xe2\x80\x99s highest court ruled in 'b'Campaign for Fiscal Equity v. State of New York'b' that the state had not met its constitutional responsibility to ensure adequate school funding and in particular had shortchanged New York City.'b'A year later, the Legislature and Gov. Eliot Spitzer adopted a new formula that promised more help for poor districts and eventually $7 billion per year in added funding. That promise evaporated in the recession, spawning two lawsuits aimed at forcing the state to honor it.'b'A lawsuit by a group called New Yorkers for Students\xe2\x80\x99 Educational Rights estimates that, despite increases in recent years, the state is still about $5.6 billion a year short of its commitment under that formula.'b'A second lawsuit was filed on behalf of students in several small cities in the state, including Jamestown, Port Jervis, Mount Vernon and Newburgh. It says that per pupil funding in the cities, which have an average 72 percent student poverty rate, is $2,500 to $6,300 'b'less'b' than called for in the 2007 formula, making it impossible to provide the instruction other services needed to meet the State Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x9csound basic education.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These communities and others like them are further disadvantaged by having low property values and by a statewide cap enacted in 2011 that limits what money they are able to raise through property taxes. And last year the New York State United Teachers union said that the 'b'cap had been particularly harmful to poorer districts'b'.'b'These inequalities are compounded by the fact that New York State, which regards itself as a bastion of liberalism, has the most racially and economically segregated schools in the nation. A 'b'scathing 2014 study'b' of this problem by the Civil Rights Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, charged that New York had essentially given up on this problem. It said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe children who most depend on the public schools for any chance in life are concentrated in schools struggling with all the dimensions of family and neighborhood poverty and isolation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Cuomo administration seemed not to acknowledge these issues in a letter last month to the chancellor of the New York State Board of Regents and the commissioner of education in which it promised \xe2\x80\x9can aggressive legislative package\xe2\x80\x9d to improve education in the state. Among the dozen issues it said it wanted to address were strengthening the teacher evaluation system, improving the process for removing low-performing teachers and improving teacher training.'b'The regents agreed that these were legitimate issues needing attention. But they also noted that these reforms were unlikely to improve the schools unless they were paired with new investments along the lines of the $2 billion in extra spending that the regents had recommended earlier. No less pointedly, they urged Mr. Cuomo to address the \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply disturbing inequalities in resources\xe2\x80\x9d that exist between poor and wealthy districts, as well as the destructive pattern of segregation. Mr. Cuomo must take on both of these central issues.'b'On a recent morning at Persahabatan Hospital in East Jakarta, patients, some from remote villages accessible only by boat, gathered in a waiting room. Nearby, lab technicians used new diagnostic technology to test sputum samples for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, in an effort to tackle a growing caseload of the deadly disease.'b'Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s recently sworn-in president, Joko Widodo, takes the reins of a rising economic power poised to play a larger role on the world stage. But he also confronts a set of entrenched public health problems fueled by the poverty in which millions of Indonesians still live. None is more urgent than the spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis across this sprawling archipelago.'b'Thanks to support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the international financing mechanism established in 2002 to help poor countries address these diseases, Indonesia has been able to provide the costly drugs for drug-resistant tuberculosis to patients free of charge. It has also supplied laboratories like the one at Persahabatan with the Xpert MTB/RIF device, which allows health workers to diagnose suspected cases of drug-resistant disease in under two hours (conventional methods take as long as eight weeks).'b'These are encouraging steps, but as Indonesia is learning, the tools of clinical medicine can do only so much. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a social disease,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Erlina Burhan, the head of pulmonology medicine at Persahabatan, told me, referring to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have 7,000 new MDR cases a year, and many of those are defaulting on their treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to understand why. For one thing, there\xe2\x80\x99s the financial strain; the drugs may be free, but as a recent multinational study found, the cost to patients \xe2\x80\x94 for everything from transportation and hospital stays to months of missed work \xe2\x80\x94 can amount to a year\xe2\x80\x99s earnings. And then there is the treatment itself: a grueling, two-year regimen of toxic drugs involving months of daily injections and possible severe side effects. And so stigmatized is tuberculosis in Indonesia that when volunteers go house to house looking for cases, families often try to hide sick relatives.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost of our patients don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the disease is transmitted,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Burhan said, \xe2\x80\x9cso they return home and spread their drug-resistant strain to others.\xe2\x80\x9d The World Health Organization estimates that every untreated MDR patient will infect, on average, between 10 and 15 people per year \xe2\x80\x94 and some of those may be their children, in whom tuberculosis is more difficult to diagnose and treat.'b'In October, the W.H.O. reported that improved data collection had revealed an epidemic significantly larger than previously estimated: In 2013, nine million people developed active tuberculosis, and of those, nearly half a million were infected with multidrug-resistant strains. Indonesia, home to the world\xe2\x80\x99s fifth-highest number of tuberculosis cases, is expected to publish its own prevalence survey soon; experts believe those figures will only add to the global burden.'b'The White House should view these trends with alarm. After all, drug-resistant tuberculosis is a threat to people everywhere, including in the United States. An outbreak in New York City that started in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s and involved drug-resistant strains cost at least $1 billion to quell. Given that caring for a single case of extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis can run more than half a million dollars, a similar outbreak today could impose crippling burdens on health departments at the front lines of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s defense. And the United States almost certainly underestimates its vulnerability.'b'Despite congressional calls to increase tuberculosis funding for the current year, President Obama proposed a 19 percent cut to the global tuberculosis budget of the United States Agency for International Development, which would put tuberculosis funding below $200 million for the first time in five years. The spending bill recently passed by Congress rejected those cuts and maintained level funding, at $236 million. That is still far below the $400 million per year public health advocates say is needed to combat the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading curable killer.'b'In 2013, President Obama pledged that America would contribute up to $5 billion to the Global Fund over the next three years. But by opposing increases to bilateral tuberculosis funding, the president jeopardizes this generous investment. While Global Fund grants support the purchase of drugs and diagnostics, like the $30,000 Xpert device, the agency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the in-country staff to ensure the tools\xe2\x80\x99 effective implementation. It\xe2\x80\x99s here that U.S.A.I.D. plays a vital role, by training technicians, strengthening supply chains and educating doctors and nurses about novel therapies.'b'Without that help, our aid dollars don\xe2\x80\x99t go nearly as far as they could. Between 2010 and 2012, for example, Indonesia, though a major recipient of Global Fund support, used only half of the funds allocated for tuberculosis control activities because it lacked the capacity to use that aid.'b'Perhaps the most tragic consequence of underfunding tuberculosis control, though, is that it undermines the fight against H.I.V. and AIDS. After billions of dollars and decades of research, antiretroviral drugs have transformed what was a death sentence into a manageable chronic disease. In spite of this monumental public health achievement, the leading killer of people living with H.I.V. today, accounting for one-quarter of AIDS deaths worldwide, is tuberculosis, a disease so neglected that the current first-line treatment is more than 50 years old.'b'Americans can no longer afford to be indifferent to the rise of drug-resistant tuberculosis. As Indonesia illustrates, technology alone can\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem. At least in the short term, poor countries need the specialized expertise only America can provide. When the president\xe2\x80\x99s budget requests for the next fiscal year are released, they should reflect the reality that if drug-resistant tuberculosis is allowed to flourish in faraway slums, it will most certainly return to haunt us \xe2\x80\x94 and at potentially great cost.'b''b' 'b''b''b''b'A volunteer trip abroad has become almost a rite of passage for a certain set of Americans, particularly students. This Op-Doc video profiles a Kenyan activist who has one simple question for them: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nearly'b' one million people'b' from America volunteer abroad each year. They are mostly young, mostly affluent and overwhelmingly white. It made me wonder: when we look to do community service, why do so many \xe2\x80\x94 particularly the privileged among us \xe2\x80\x94 look to places so far from home?'b'I followed the Kenyan photojournalist and activist Boniface Mwangi as he spoke with American college students to get to the core of why it can be more appealing to \xe2\x80\x9csave\xe2\x80\x9d Africans like him than to address social inequalities on their own soil.'b'As Americans, we\xe2\x80\x99re inundated with images of hungry African children, but what about the plight of children in this country? Our child poverty rate is at its highest level in 20 years, with nearly one in four children living in homes without enough food. Among our homeless population, there are nearly 'b'2.5 million children'b'. Mr. Mwangi points particularly to the racial inequality in this country, highlighting the staggering rate of incarceration for African-American men, which is 'b'nearly six times the rate'b' for white men.'b'Mr. Mwangi and his peers are not suggesting that Westerners simply stay home or disengage with Africans. They are pushing them to take an honest look at their motives for helping overseas versus at home, think about how their efforts could potentially diminish or supplant African-grown initiatives and consider a more respectful connection between equals.'b'As Mr. Mwangi said to a group of students at Duke University: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to come and help me, first ask me what I want\xe2\x80\xa6 Then we can work together.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 ROBERT J. BEALL, the president and chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, called his recent decision to sell the royalty rights to his organization\xe2\x80\x99s research a \xe2\x80\x9cgame changer.\xe2\x80\x9d Indeed: Deals like this, in which an investment company 'b'paid the foundation $3.3 billion'b' for its future royalties from several cystic fibrosis drugs it helped finance, could revolutionize the way medical research is funded. Rather than the staid model of government-funded institutions handing out grants to academic research facilities, a new breed of \xe2\x80\x9cventure philanthropies\xe2\x80\x9d like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation could corral private investment into developing lifesaving drugs quickly and cheaply.'b'The problem is that venture philanthropy is, essentially, another term for privatizing scientific research. Instead of decisions about the fate of scientific funding being made by publicly oriented institutions, those decisions are being put in the hands of anonymous philanthropists and ostensibly benevolent nonprofits.'b'At the risk of oversimplification, biomedical research divides into two categories: private and public. The former is the constellation of big pharmaceutical companies and start-up labs. The latter comprises government agencies and the universities and philanthropies that rely on government support \xe2\x80\x94 directly, through grants, or indirectly, through tax policy. The former can charge whatever it wants for its products; the latter is limited by government rules and price controls.'b'Venture philanthropy complicates this picture by introducing a tax-exempt loophole. An organization like the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation will take in tax-exempt donations to invest in a pharmaceutical company \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, 'b'Vertex Pharmaceuticals'b' \xe2\x80\x94 to develop drugs based on publicly funded research. Venture philanthropies can then sell the results of that research to private industry to deliver drugs to the market.'b'There is nothing to stop pharmaceutical companies from creating their own philanthropies, funding research with tax-exempt dollars and then selling themselves the rights to the intellectual property. Without price controls on the final product that come with public funding, the potential costs of the resulting medicines are limitless.'b'So far, there is no effort to extend government price controls to venture-philanthropy-derived research. The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation did little to lobby for lower prices on the drugs that were developed from the research it funded. As a result, Kalydeco, a cystic fibrosis medication it funded, is one of the most expensive drugs available, at $300,000 a year.'b'The idea of a public-private research transfer is not without precedent. In 1980, Congress passed the 'b'Bayh-Dole Act'b', which allowed publicly funded universities to sell off exclusive licenses on their research to private industry. The act was intended to drive funding for academic research and innovation.'b'But the resulting race for private funding has created perverse incentives to research blockbuster drugs, even if they are not the most imperative from a public policy standpoint. The impetus to produce more and more profitable research has also driven down the quality of academic work, promoting ghostwritten papers, sloppy peer review and the burying of unfavorable clinical-trial results. Venture philanthropy builds off the model created by Bayh-Dole, but with tax exemptions and a sheen of generosity on top of the lucrative payoff.'b'One argument in favor of venture philanthropy is that it creates a way to sustain small foundations that study rare diseases that, from a for-profit point of view, aren\xe2\x80\x99t worth investigating.'b'But while Big Pharma might be faulted for funneling billions of dollars into erectile-dysfunction drugs and off-label drug marketing, researching extremely rare diseases may also represent a misuse of public and private funds. Efforts to cure, rather than treat or prevent, obscure diseases can be expensive, diverting investment from more common afflictions. The high costs of focusing on rare diseases are then eventually pushed onto the health care system by way of egregiously high drug prices. Such a choice involves an incredibly complex moral calculus, one that is best processed by democratic public institutions.'b'To make medical advancements truly philanthropic, the profit motive needs to be removed from the equation. If the intent is to cure rare diseases, then we should be increasing the budget for the National Institutes of Health and other research initiatives. Instead of gala balls and donor drives, higher taxes on the same rich benefactors could be used to fund the research that isn\xe2\x80\x99t already being supported. Biotech patents developed through venture philanthropy should not have exclusive rights attached to them.'b'This would allow generic versions of drugs onto the market, which would go a long way toward keeping health care costs down and not driving the uninsured into debt.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 WHEN I began as the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s envoy for closing the detention facility at 'b'Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay'b', many people advised me that progress was impossible. They were wrong.'b'In the two years before I started, on July 1, 2013, only four people were transferred from Guant\xc3\xa1namo. Over the past 18 months, we moved 39 people out of there, and more transfers are coming. The population at Guant\xc3\xa1namo \xe2\x80\x94 127 \xe2\x80\x94 is at its lowest level since the facility opened in January 2002. We also worked with Congress to remove unnecessary obstacles to foreign transfers. We began an administrative process to review the status of detainees not yet approved for transfer or formally charged with crimes.'b'While there have been zigs and zags, we have made great progress. The path to closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo during the Obama administration is clear, but it will take intense and sustained action to finish the job. The government must continue and accelerate the transfers of those approved for release. Administrative review of those not approved for transfer must be expedited. The absolute and irrational ban on transfers to the United States for any purpose, including detention and prosecution, must be changed as the population is reduced to a small core of detainees who cannot safely be transferred overseas. (Ten detainees, for example, face criminal charges before the 'b'military commissions'b' that Congress set up in lieu of regular courts.)'b'The reasons for closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo are more compelling than ever. As a high-ranking security official from one of our staunchest allies on counterterrorism (not from Europe) once told me, \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest single action the United States can take to fight terrorism is to close Guant\xc3\xa1namo.\xe2\x80\x9d I have seen firsthand the way in which Guant\xc3\xa1namo frays and damages vitally important security relationships with countries around the world. The eye-popping cost \xe2\x80\x94 around $3 million per detainee last year, compared with roughly $75,000 at a \xe2\x80\x9csupermax\xe2\x80\x9d prison in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 drains vital resources.'b'Americans from across the spectrum agree on closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo. President George W. Bush called it \xe2\x80\x9ca propaganda tool for our enemies and a distraction for our allies.\xe2\x80\x9d Kenneth L. Wainstein, who advised Mr. Bush on homeland security, said keeping the facility open was not \xe2\x80\x9csustainable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 18 months at the State Department, I was sometimes frustrated by opposition to closing the facility in Congress and some corners of Washington. It reflects three fundamental misconceptions that have impeded the process.'b'First, not every person at Guant\xc3\xa1namo is a continuing danger. Of the 127 individuals there (from a peak of close to 800), 59 have been \xe2\x80\x9capproved for transfer.\xe2\x80\x9d This means that six agencies \xe2\x80\x94 the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State, as well as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence \xe2\x80\x94 have unanimously approved the person for release based on everything known about the individual and the risk he presents. For most of those approved, this rigorous decision was made half a decade ago. Almost 90 percent of those approved are from 'b'Yemen'b', where the security situation is perilous. They are not \xe2\x80\x9cthe worst of the worst,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather people with the worst luck. (We recently resettled several Yemenis in other countries, the first time any Yemeni had been transferred from Guant\xc3\xa1namo in more than four years.)'b'Second, opponents of closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo \xe2\x80\x94 including former Vice President Dick Cheney \xe2\x80\x94 cite a 30 percent recidivism rate among former detainees. This assertion is deeply flawed. It combines those \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d of having engaged in hostile activities with those \xe2\x80\x9csuspected.\xe2\x80\x9d Focusing on the \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d slashes the percentage nearly in half. Moreover, many of the \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed\xe2\x80\x9d have been killed or recaptured.'b'Most important, there is a vast difference between those transferred before 2009, when President Obama ordered the intensive review process by the six agencies, and those transferred after that review. Of the detainees transferred during this administration, more than 90 percent have not been suspected, much less confirmed, of committing any hostile activities after their release. The percentage of detainees who were transferred after the Obama-era review and then found to have engaged in terrorist or insurgent activities is 6.8 percent. While we want that number to be zero, that small percentage does not justify holding in perpetuity the overwhelming majority of detainees, who do not subsequently engage in wrongdoing.'b'Third, a common impression is that we cannot find countries that will accept detainees from Guant\xc3\xa1namo. One of the happiest surprises of my tenure was that this is not the case. Many countries, from Slovakia and Georgia to Uruguay, have been willing to provide homes for individuals who cannot return to their own countries. Support from the Organization of American States, the Vatican and other religious and human rights organizations has also been helpful.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t question the motives of those who oppose the efforts to close Guant\xc3\xa1namo. Some are constrained by an overabundance of caution, refusing to trust the extensive security reviews that are in place. Others are hampered by an outdated view of the risk posed by many of the remaining detainees. A third group fails to recognize that the deep stain on our standing in the world is more dangerous than any individual approved for transfer. These concerns, however well-intentioned, collapse in the glare of a careful examination of the facts.'b'The road to closing Guant\xc3\xa1namo is clear and well lit. We are now approaching the 13th anniversary of the opening of the Guant\xc3\xa1namo detention facility. Imprisoning men without charges for this long \xe2\x80\x94 many of whom have been approved for transfer for almost half the period of their incarceration \xe2\x80\x94 is not in line with the country we aspire to be.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'After a Spa Day, Looking Years Younger (O.K., They\xe2\x80\x99re Only 7)'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 3):'b'You report that a mother who treated her 7- and 8-year-old daughters to a spa day said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want them to feel that my saying \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 means that I don\xe2\x80\x99t love them.\xe2\x80\x9d This false dilemma sounds like a recipe for family dysfunction, or worse.'b'Be brave, parents: Dare to say no.

Andrew Cuomo of New York gave a politically important speech last week that got lost in the news that his father, former Gov. Mario Cuomo, had died that same afternoon. The 'b'speech'b' \xe2\x80\x94 his second inaugural address \xe2\x80\x94 touched on some of the high points of his first term while laying out an ambitious agenda for his next four years.'b'Mr. Cuomo asserted that he had tamed a dysfunctional state capital in his first four years in office. \xe2\x80\x9cWe made the government work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that the \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d included both \xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans and Democrats who put New York first and political parties second, even in this age of hyperpartisanship.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While he acknowledged that more remained to be done to address education, ethical failure and other state problems, much of the speech seemed pitched to a wider audience. In tones and cadence that reminded many of his father, whose oratory made him a national political figure, Mr. Cuomo said that it is important to look beyond New York because \xe2\x80\x9cthe most severe problems we face go beyond the borders of our state.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These problems include economic inequality, which calls into question \xe2\x80\x9cthe American promise itself\xe2\x80\x9d, as well as racial discrimination in education and in the administration of justice. He described \xe2\x80\x9ctwo education systems\xe2\x80\x9d, one for the rich, one for the poor, adding that public education had become \xe2\x80\x9cthe great discriminator\xe2\x80\x9d in some communities. He warned that the American justice system needs review and reform, not just in New York City or even in Ferguson, Mo., but nationwide. At risk, he suggested, \xe2\x80\x9care the primary democratic institutions of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps inevitably, the breadth of the speech raised questions about Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term ambitions. In his first term, the governor did not seek national attention. He stayed mostly inside the state until last year when he went to Israel, Afghanistan and Puerto Rico. He has publicly dismissed talk of presidential aspirations and said that if Hillary Rodham Clinton seeks the Democratic nomination, he would not.'b'But now he is reportedly planning to attend the annual gathering of financial and political bigwigs in Davos, Switzerland, later this month. And he has scheduled five international trade missions \xe2\x80\x94 China, Mexico, Canada, Israel and Italy. Those trips could help New York\xe2\x80\x99s economy. They could also help fill a gap in the r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 of an ambitious politician who needs foreign policy experience.'b'Well-organized criminal gangs are increasing the pressure on Europe to deal with illegal migration across the Mediterranean by using a terrible new 'b'tactic'b': Sending rusty old freighters filled with refugees hurtling full throttle toward Italy\xe2\x80\x99s shores and certain disaster. It\xe2\x80\x99s a game of chicken, and the smugglers know that Europe has no moral option but to rescue the ships\xe2\x80\x99 human cargo.'b'More than 3,000 migrants drowned in the Mediterranean in 2014 fleeing conflict-torn regions across the Middle East and North Africa. Even as the number of people trafficked soars, European governments persist in their magical thinking, believing that somehow these people, who have no legal options and no better hope for survival, will abandon dangerous attempts to reach Europe.'b'Italy has stepped up to the immediate challenge, rescuing some 1,200 men, women and children from two separate crewless freighters last week. But the country is overwhelmed. Of the 200,000 refugees and migrants who arrived in Europe in 2014, 160,000 arrived in Italy by sea.'b'Last month, Italy phased out its Mare Nostrum marine rescue program, which was created after more than 350 migrants drowned when their boat sank off the coast of Lampedusa in October 2013. The program is credited with saving more than 100,000 people, but the cost \xe2\x80\x94 9 million euros (about $10.7 million) per month \xe2\x80\x94 was too much for Italy to bear. And Italy, rightly, feels as though Europe should pay for what is essentially a European problem.'b'Europe\xe2\x80\x99s limited replacement for Mare Nostrum, dubbed Triton and administered by the European Union border-control agency Frontex, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t come close to Mare Nostrum\xe2\x80\x99s Mediterranean-wide rescue effort. Triton\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x82\xac2.9 million per month budget is only a third of what Mare Nostrum\xe2\x80\x99s was. The British government of Prime Minister David Cameron, which has claimed that rescuing migrants at sea will only encourage more to risk the journey, declined to contribute to Triton at all.'b'In the meantime, the smugglers operating out of the Turkish port of Mersin are using a despicable new tactic that is highly profitable. They are reaping millions of dollars in profits by filling old freighters destined for the scrap heap with mostly Syrian refugees willing to pay $6,000 per person for an illegal passage to Europe. Unlike the rickety boats that have carried most migrants headed for Europe from Libya, the freighters setting out from Turkey can be operated on winter\xe2\x80\x99s stormier seas, allowing smugglers to expand their business into a year-round operation.'b'On Monday, the European Commission 'b'vowed swift action'b' against smugglers aiming dilapidated freighters at Italy\xe2\x80\x99s coastline. But there is only one way to put the smugglers out of business: create more legal avenues for migrants seeking safety, especially those trying to reunite with family members already in Europe.'b'Europe should also move to decriminalize illegal migration. This would encourage migrants to identify smugglers and their unscrupulous agents, and help law enforcement break up the criminal networks that prey on the most vulnerable groups. Given the murderous tactics of the traffickers, European leaders must find the resolve to set aside growing anti-migrant sentiment, and forge a united and adequately financed policy to stop this tragic trend at Europe\xe2\x80\x99s door.'b'Even if they were acquitted on the ludicrous charge of \xe2\x80\x9cdebauchery,\xe2\x80\x9d the 26 Egyptian men on trial in the government\xe2\x80\x99s latest crackdown on gays are likely to suffer a lifetime of public scorn.'b'Over the past two years, there has been no shortage of travesties and injustices in Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s courtrooms. The country\xe2\x80\x99s ousted dictator, Hosni Mubarak, 'b'was sentenced to life'b' in prison in 2012, lying on a stretcher placed within a cage, 'b'only to be acquitted'b' two years later in a subsequent proceeding once his allies were in power again. Mr. Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s Islamist successor, Mohamed Morsi, who was removed from power in a military coup, 'b'was locked up in a soundproof cage'b' at his trial last year. Three journalists employed by the Doha-based Al Jazeera English network were 'b'outrageously sentenced'b' to lengthy prison terms in June on allegations that they had aided the Muslim Brotherhood, following a ridiculous trial that turned them into scapegoats of a fight between Egypt and Qatar.'b'The 'b'trial underway now'b' seems particularly cruel. On Dec. 7, Mona Iraqi, a television journalist who works for a pro-government channel, barged into a traditional hammam, or bathhouse, in Cairo, to document 'b'what she billed'b' as \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest den of group perversion\xe2\x80\x9d in the Egyptian capital. The police, operating in concert with her, promptly raided the establishment. Ms. Iraqi posted photos of naked men being corralled by authorities and promised viewers, in a since-deleted Facebook post, that her expos\xc3\xa9 would feature the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole story of the dens for spreading AIDS in Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Egyptian government 'b'has persecuted gay men with varying degrees of intensity'b' over the past two decades. The latest crackdown has driven the gay community underground like never before. It is not entirely clear why Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military leaders have ordered, or condoned, the prosecutions of men accused of being gay. In a deeply conservative Muslim country, demonizing sexual minorities has served in the past as an effective way of deflecting attention from actual problems the state has failed to fix.'b'As part of the investigation, most of the men taken into custody were subjected to forensic anal exams, a depraved practice denounced by human rights groups and discredited by international medical professionals. The tests, performed in an effort to determine whether the men had had anal sex, are used as evidence in judicial proceedings.'b'As the trial, which began on Dec. 21, resumed on Sunday, some of the defendants, standing inside a courtroom cage, used hoodies to cover their faces. Some wept, according to reporters allowed inside the courtroom. The judge 'b'said on Monday'b' that he would issue a verdict on Jan. 12. Gay sex is not explicitly illegal under Egyptian law, so authorities have traditionally charged them with \xe2\x80\x9cdebauchery,\xe2\x80\x9d a broad term typically used to prosecute sex workers.'b'Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of gays is part of a dismal human rights record that has only gotten worse in recent months. The Obama administration and American lawmakers have not done enough to denounce the abuses of an 'b'increasingly authoritarian Egyptian government,'b' which is one of the largest recipients of 'b'American military aid. 'b'As Congress convenes this week, influential lawmakers should take a fresh look at the plight of vulnerable Egyptians and speak out on their behalf. Among them are Representative Kay Granger, a Texas Republican who 'b'has fought efforts'b' to pare back Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s military package, and Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.'b'The 26 men on trial now may never be able to shed the stigma this prosecution has inflicted on them, their careers and their families. But strong international condemnation may keep authorities in Egypt from victimizing more men.'b'Not long ago, a friend sent me a speech that the great civic leader John Gardner gave to the Stanford Alumni Association 61 years after he graduated from that college. The speech is chock-full of practical wisdom. I especially liked this passage:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe things you learn in maturity aren\xe2\x80\x99t simple things such as acquiring information and skills. You learn not to engage in self-destructive behavior. You learn not to burn up energy in anxiety. You discover how to manage your tensions. You learn that self-pity and resentment are among the most toxic of drugs. You find that the world loves talent but pays off on character.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou come to understand that most people are neither for you nor against you; they are thinking about themselves. You learn that no matter how hard you try to please, some people in this world are not going to love you, a lesson that is at first troubling and then really quite relaxing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gardner goes on in this wise way. And then, at the end, he goes into a peroration about leading a meaningful life. \xe2\x80\x9cMeaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you. ... You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gardner puts \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning\xe2\x80\x9d at the apogee of human existence. His speech reminded me how often we\xe2\x80\x99ve heard that word over the past decades. As my Times colleague April Lawson puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning\xe2\x80\x9d has become the stand-in concept for everything the soul yearns for and seeks. It is one of the few phrases acceptable in modern parlance to describe a fundamentally spiritual need.'b'Yet what do we mean when we use the word meaning?'b'The first thing we mean is that life should be about more than material success. The person leading a meaningful life has found some way of serving others that leads to a feeling of significance.'b'Second, a meaningful life is more satisfying than a merely happy life. Happiness is about enjoying the present; meaning is about dedicating oneself to the future. Happiness is about receiving; meaningfulness is about giving. Happiness is about upbeat moods and nice experiences. People leading meaningful lives experience a deeper sense of satisfaction.'b'In this way, meaning is an uplifting state of consciousness. It\xe2\x80\x99s what you feel when you\xe2\x80\x99re serving things beyond self.'b'Yet it has to be said, as commonly used today, the word is flabby and vacuous, the product of a culture that has grown inarticulate about inner life.'b'Let me put it this way: If we look at the people in history who achieved great things \xe2\x80\x94 like Nelson Mandela or Albert Schweitzer or Abraham Lincoln \xe2\x80\x94 it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because they wanted to bathe luxuriously in their own sense of meaningfulness. They had objective and eternally true standards of justice and injustice. They were indignant when those eternal standards were violated. They subscribed to moral systems \xe2\x80\x94 whether secular or religious \xe2\x80\x94 that recommended specific ways of being, and had specific structures of what is right and wrong, and had specific disciplines about how you might get better over time.'b'Meaningfulness tries to replace structures, standards and disciplines with self-regarding emotion. The ultimate authority of meaningful is the warm tingling we get when we feel significant and meaningful. Meaningfulness tries to replace moral systems with the emotional corona that surrounds acts of charity.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a paltry substitute. Because meaningfulness is built solely on an emotion, it is contentless and irreducible. Because it is built solely on emotion, it\xe2\x80\x99s subjective and relativistic. You get meaning one way. I get meaning another way. Who is any of us to judge another\xe2\x80\x99s emotion?'b'Because it\xe2\x80\x99s based solely on sentiment, it is useless. There are no criteria to determine what kind of meaningfulness is higher. There\xe2\x80\x99s no practical manual that would help guide each of us as we move from shallower forms of service to deeper ones. There is no hierarchy of values that would help us select, from among all the things we might do, that activity which is highest and best to do.'b'Because it\xe2\x80\x99s based solely on emotion, it\xe2\x80\x99s fleeting. When the sensations of meaningful go away then the cause that once aroused them gets dropped, too. Ennui floods in. Personal crisis follows. There\xe2\x80\x99s no reliable ground.'b'The philosophy of meaningfulness emerges in a culture in which there is no common moral vocabulary or framework. It emerges amid radical pluralism, when people don\xe2\x80\x99t want to judge each other. Meaningfulness emerges when the fundamental question is, do we feel good?'b'Real moral systems are based on a balance of intellectual rigor and aroused moral sentiments. Meaningfulness is pure and self-regarding feeling, the NutraSweet of the inner life.'b'The cover story of The New York Times Magazine on Sunday, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Wreck of the Kulluk'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by McKenzie Funk, is one of those articles that you can\xe2\x80\x99t put down even though you know how it turns out. The Kulluk was an offshore exploratory drilling rig, owned by Royal Dutch Shell, which, in December 2012, ran aground in some of the most inhospitable waters in the world.'b'Those waters were the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas in the Arctic Circle, more than 1,000 miles from Dutch Harbor, Alaska, the nearest deep-water port. The rig, which had been towed \xe2\x80\x94 with great difficulty \xe2\x80\x94 to the Beaufort Sea, was in the process of being towed out again, barely two months after the drill bit touched the sea floor, before ice formations would make the route impassable. The Kulluk and its tow soon ran into a series of dangerous storms. Although no one died, Funk keeps you on the edge of your seat by describing in detail the hair-raising ordeal, which led to the tow captain of a rescue tugboat cutting the Kulluk adrift to ensure his own men\xe2\x80\x99s safety. The Kulluk\xe2\x80\x99s crew, meanwhile, was airlifted via helicopter, in a dramatic, and dangerous, rescue.'b'Funk also does a nice job laying out all the mistakes Shell made. Despite spending $6 billion preparing to explore for oil in this remote part of the world, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan adequately, and it cut too many corners. According to the Coast Guard, 'b'which investigated the Kulluk disaster'b', not only had Shell\xe2\x80\x99s risk management been \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate,\xe2\x80\x9d but there also had been a significant number of \xe2\x80\x9cpotential violations of law and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I came away from Funk\xe2\x80\x99s article, however, with another thought: Even if Shell had done everything right, what were the chances of something bad happening to the Kulluk, or, more broadly, to any drilling program in that part of the Arctic? They were high. Although this area is considered to hold one of the last great oil fields \xe2\x80\x94 with an estimated 23 billion barrels \xe2\x80\x94 is drilling for it really worth the risks?'b'The first issue is the weather. One of the reasons this remote location is at least theoretically accessible to oil companies is because of climate change. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is less ice, and it is receding from the shore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael LeVine, the Pacific senior counsel of Oceana, an environmental group dedicated to preserving the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans. But, he adds, climate change is also affecting the wind, the water and the currents. An area that was already remote, cold and dark is something else as well: unpredictable. Companies trying to explore for oil in the region are essentially flying blind.'b'Then there is the question of whether the government is up to the task of regulating such high-risk ventures. The answer is: probably not. Even after the Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 and despite 'b'some improvements'b' in safety regulations \xe2\x80\x94 government regulation is still way behind the oil industry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technological capabilities and the need for oil companies to drill in more remote places has outstripped the government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to keep up with it,\xe2\x80\x9d LeVine told me.'b'There are a host of important environmental issues: the industry hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gotten better at dealing with oil spills since the Exxon Valdez spill 25 years ago, for instance. Yet because the climate is so difficult, the chances of an environmental calamity are increased.'b'As regular readers know, 'b'I am hardly opposed to drilling for oil or gas'b'. Yet this particular high-risk venture seems both foolish and unnecessary. For one thing, the world is awash in oil, thanks to a slowdown in demand and increase in supply because of the fracking revolution. For another, the price of oil is so low as to make new, expensive exploration in the Arctic unprofitable.'b'Most of all, though, we\xe2\x80\x99re just not ready to drill for this oil. As LeVine put it, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe we have the technological capability to extract these resources safely.\xe2\x80\x9d To me, that is the real moral of the story of the Kulluk.'b'Oil companies, of course, are fundamentally built to find oil. Shell had once embraced climate change and the need for renewable energy. But it eventually realized that it lacked the proper expertise, and it got rid of its investments in wind and solar to refocus on oil and gas. Now, like every other big oil company, it must explore for oil in evermore hostile environments, because those are the only fields left untapped. Despite its travails with the Kulluk, Shell has submitted a plan that would have it going back to the Chukchi later this year.'b'The oil in the Arctic Circle isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere. If, two decades from now, we need it, maybe by then the industry and the government will be in a position to drill for it \xe2\x80\x94 and regulate it \xe2\x80\x94 safely. But maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll get lucky. Or smart.'b'Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99ll never need it at all.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'A Dec. 14 'b'column by Mark Bittman'b' offered a serious indictment of our wealthy country\xe2\x80\x99s inability to care for its people.

Fast-food workers in America earn an average of less than $9 an hour, contributing to the tens of millions of working poor who are forced to rely on government assistance to survive.'b'In most European countries mothers receive professional parenting support and almost full pay for many months in order to be with their newborns; we are the only developed country to have no maternity leave policy. And sadly we accept too easily that one in five of our children grow up in poverty, more than in most other developed countries.'b'Nor are we troubled that these other countries proudly provide all their citizens with complete medical coverage. Here many of our Republican-led states have, for political reasons, refused to take the 100 percent financing from Washington to extend Medicaid to more people.'b'On most indexes of people\xe2\x80\x99s well-being, the United States lags far behind comparable nations. The time has come for Americans to acknowledge that we as a nation are failing our citizens.

It was official confirmation that our original trial was seriously flawed and that our convictions, in June, were erroneous.'b'We have been pawns in a geopolitical game that had nothing to do with our work as impartial professionals.

In reality, we are closer to being hostages.'b'I started work as chief of the Al Jazeera English bureau in Cairo in September 2013. That month, an Egyptian court 'b'banned the Arabic-language TV channel'b' Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, an Egyptian affiliate also owned by Qatar. In issuing the ruling, the judge said that the Arabic service was biased toward the Muslim Brotherhood and had become a threat to national security.'b'Despite the banning of Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, I accepted the challenge to run the Al Jazeera English bureau because I trusted the professionalism of its journalists and because I believed the Egyptian government would respect the difference between the two channels.'b'From Day 1, I made that distinction clear in every communication and whenever we interviewed people. We conducted our own booking and news-gathering. The reports my team produced for Al Jazeera English were well sourced, fair and balanced.'b'I also emphasized to the management in Qatar that none of our reports should be dubbed in Arabic and broadcast from the Doha studios where Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr continued to defy the Egyptian ban. With no crews on the ground in Egypt, the Arabic service relied mostly on footage from citizen journalists and agencies like Reuters.'b'On Dec. 25, 2013, the Egyptian cabinet 'b'designated the Muslim Brotherhood a terrorist organization'b'. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates followed suit. Four days later, we were arrested.'b'The Egyptian authorities had decided to ignore the difference between the English and Arabic channels. Yet prosecutors at our trial failed to produce any convincing evidence.'b'A lead investigator testified under oath that I worked for Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr, testimony that was demonstrably false. To add insult to injury, the bulk of what was presented as video evidence against me 'b'listed reports that dated back to 2011-13'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a period when I was working for CNN.'b'In reality, the court was trying Qatar \xe2\x80\x94 which the former head of the Saudi intelligence, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, was quoted in The Wall Street Journal in 2013 as describing as \xe2\x80\x9cnothing but 300 people ... and a TV station.\xe2\x80\x9d We three journalists had unwittingly been dragged into a cold war between Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain on one hand and Qatar and its allies, including Turkey, on the other.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that Qatar supported the government of President Mohamed Morsi politically and financially. When millions of Egyptians, with the support of the military, 'b'ended the Muslim Brotherhood\xe2\x80\x99s rule on July 3, 2013'b', Qatar retaliated by withdrawing $10 billion in investments. The Saudis stepped in, soon joined by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and pledged $12 billion to support Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s interim government.'b'Finally, on Nov. 16, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain 'b'agreed to reinstate their ambassadors to Qatar'b'. The Saudi-led coalition brokered a reconciliation between Egypt and Qatar, and the Riyadh Agreement was signed \xe2\x80\x94 signaling an end to the monthslong spat.'b'In return, Qatar agreed to stop meddling in the internal affairs of other Gulf Cooperation Council members and Egypt. The 'b'closing of Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr'b' was part of the price.'b'Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s decision to end the Arabic service was a cause of celebration for millions of Egyptians, as well as for us journalists behind bars.

She made her way to Interstate 71, where she stepped in front of a tractor-trailer. 'b'A note'b' she left behind on Tumblr read, in part, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease don\xe2\x80\x99t be sad, it\xe2\x80\x99s for the better.

It is a tragedy that Leelah was never given the chance to be proud of who she was, and that she thought the only way to change the world was through her death.'b'Suicide is a constant among transgender people; we are one of the most at-risk groups in the country. 'b'One study'b' suggests that over 40 percent of us attempt it during the course of our lives.'b'I was among that number.

But for many of us it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, because of unsupportive families, because of a lack of resources, because we do not yet have the courage to embark upon what seems like a frightening path. In that scenario, the best strategy may simply be having faith in the future, and finding a way to survive until you\xe2\x80\x99re able to control your own destiny. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the things that helped me are of any use to someone born, as Leelah was, in 1997. But the last week has given me occasion to think back on how it was I got this far.'b'My own life was saved in part by books. When I found Jan Morris\xe2\x80\x99s 1974 memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cConundrum,\xe2\x80\x9d it was as if I\xe2\x80\x99d found a wormhole to another universe, a galaxy where people like me could thrive. I wish I could have also given Leelah two more recent works: 'b'Janet Mock'b'\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRedefining Realness\xe2\x80\x9d and 'b'Kate Bornstein'b'\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHello Cruel World.\xe2\x80\x9d They might have made a difference.'b'If reading provided me with solace, so did writing. Keeping a journal, telling stories, inventing worlds gave me comfort until the time came when I had the agency to make my own choices. Narrative helped me find a through-line in the chaos of my life.'b'There were other times, quite frankly, when simply making a lot of noise saved me, too. I pounded my family\xe2\x80\x99s piano until the strings broke; I played in a band that played two songs, one of which was \xe2\x80\x9cTurn on Your Love Light,\xe2\x80\x9d and one of which was not. Making noise helped me know I existed, helped me in some inarticulate way express the pain I felt inside. There were winter nights when I shouted at the sky. Sometimes my own voice echoed back at me.'b'Read, Write, Scream is not exactly \xe2\x80\x9cEat, Pray, Love,\xe2\x80\x9d but it worked for me. And there are lots of other resources available now that I did not have in the 1970s, including the hashtag #RealLiveTransAdult that leads to many stories of people who survived and thrived.'b'It may still be possible to fulfill at least one of Leelah\xe2\x80\x99s wishes.

In 2015, they might be Europe\xe2\x80\x99s catchphrase.'b'As the United States economy slowly recovers, analysts across the political spectrum see little to cheer them from Europe. The optimists see the region\xe2\x80\x99s economy growing by just 1 percent in 2015; many others fear that a triple-dip recession is in the offing. Germany is widely viewed as a healthy country whose prosperity helps compensate for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, yet over the past two quarters for which we have data, it has 'b'experienced no net growth at all. 'b' Predictions of decade-long deflation, low productivity and high unemployment are becoming conventional wisdom.'b'What does the Continent need? Most economists and pundits focus on monetary and fiscal policy, as well as labor-market reform. Get the policy levers and economic incentives right, and the Continent might escape the vortex of decline, right?'b'Probably not. As important as good economic policies are, they will not fix Europe\xe2\x80\x99s core problems, which are demographic, not economic. This was the point made in a speech to the European Parliament in November by none other than Pope Francis. As the pontiff 'b'put it'b', \xe2\x80\x9cIn many quarters we encounter a general impression of weariness and aging, of a Europe which is now a \xe2\x80\x98grandmother,\xe2\x80\x99 no longer fertile and vibrant.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But wait, it gets worse: Grandma Europe is not merely growing old. She is also getting dotty. She is, as the pope 'b'sadly explained'b' in an earlier speech to a conference of bishops, \xe2\x80\x9cweary with disorientation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some readers might regret the pope\xe2\x80\x99s use of language \xe2\x80\x94 we love our grandmothers, weary with disorientation or not. But as my American Enterprise Institute colleague Nicholas Eberstadt shows in his research, the pope\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is fundamentally sound.'b'Start with age. According to the United States Census Bureau\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'International Database'b', nearly one in five Western Europeans was 65 years old or older in 2014. This is hard enough to endure, given the countries\xe2\x80\x99 early retirement ages and pay-as-you-go pension systems. But by 2030, this will have risen to one in four. If history is any guide, aging electorates will direct larger and larger portions of gross domestic product to retirement benefits \xe2\x80\x94 and invest less in opportunity for future generations.'b'Next, look at fertility. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the last time the countries of the European Union were reproducing at replacement levels (that is, slightly more than two children per woman) was the mid-1970s. In 2014, the average number of children per woman was about 1.6. That\xe2\x80\x99s up a hair from the nadir in 2001, but has been falling again for more than half a decade. Imagine a world where many people have no sisters, brothers, cousins, aunts or uncles. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Europe is heading in the coming decades. On the bright side, at least there will be fewer Christmas presents to buy.'b'There are some exceptions. France has risen to exactly two children per woman in 2012, from 1.95 in 1980, an increase largely attributed to a system of government payments to parents, not a change in the culture of family life. Is there anything more dystopian than the notion that population decline can be slowed only when states bribe their citizens to reproduce?'b'Finally, consider employment. Last September, the United States\xe2\x80\x99 'b'labor force participation rate'b' \xe2\x80\x94 the percentage of adults who are either working or looking for work \xe2\x80\x94 reached a 36-year low of just 62.7 percent.'b'Yet as bad as that is, the United States looks decent compared with most of Europe. Our friends across the Atlantic like to say that we live to work, while they work to live. That might be compelling if more of them were actually working. According to the most recent data available from the World Bank, the labor force participation rate in the European Union in 2013 was 57.5 percent. In France it was 55.9 percent. In Italy, just 49.1 percent.'b'One bright spot might seem to be immigration. In 2012, the median age of the national population in the European Union was 41.9 years, while the median age of foreigners living in the union was 34.7. So, are Europeans pleased that there will be new arrivals to work and pay taxes when the locals retire?'b'Not exactly. Anti-immigrant sentiment is surging across the Continent. Nativist movements performed 'b'alarmingly well'b' in European Parliament elections last year. Europe is less like a grandmother knitting placidly in the window and more like an angry grandfather, shaking his rake and yelling at outsiders to get off his lawn.'b'None of this should give Americans cause for schadenfreude. At a purely practical level, a European market in further decline will suppress American growth. But more important, European deterioration will dissipate the vast good the Continent can do in spreading the values of democracy and freedom around the world.'b'So what is the prescription for Europe\xe2\x80\x99s ills \xe2\x80\x94 and the lesson for America\xe2\x80\x99s future?'b'It is true that good monetary and fiscal policies are important. But the deeper problems in Europe will not be solved by the European Central Bank. No matter what the money supply and public spending levels, a country or continent will be in decline if it rejects the culture of family, turns its back on work, and closes itself to strivers from the outside.'b'Europe needs visionary leaders and a social movement to rediscover that people are assets to develop, not liabilities to manage. If it cannot or will not meet this existential challenge, a \xe2\x80\x9clost decade\xe2\x80\x9d will look like a walk in the park for Grandma Europe.'b'We measure our presidents against not only our hopes for the present, which are sometimes unreasonable, but also our understanding of the past, which can be just as flawed.'b'Has a misreading of history informed a misappraisal of Barack Obama?'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a question raised, not explicitly but implicitly, by a new book by the Princeton historian Julian Zelizer, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Fierce Urgency of Now,\xe2\x80\x9d to be published on Thursday.'b'Its setting is the 1960s, as the title, a phrase uttered by Martin Luther King Jr., suggests. Its focus is Lyndon Johnson. And one of its conclusions is that despite Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s legend as a peerless legislative tactician, he was largely a hostage of Congress and of forces beyond the presidency.'b'Zelizer reminds us that many of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s signature victories came during a two-year period when Democrats had two-thirds majorities in both the Senate, where they held 68 seats, and the House, where they held 295.'b'Zelizer also reminds us that Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s trouncing of Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election spooked Republicans to a point where many fought progressive legislation less stridently than before, lest they be portrayed as Goldwater-style extremists.'b'Those dynamics and others worked powerfully to Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s advantage, and when the climate and the Congress changed, so did his fortunes. On the domestic front (as well as on the foreign one), the final two years of his presidency were a bust, at least in comparison with what preceded them.'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s name appears just twice in Zelizer\xe2\x80\x99s book. But it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible not to think of him more often, given how frequently the yardstick of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s presidency has been applied to his.'b'If only Obama were a schmoozer like Johnson. If only he had Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s taste for the muck of lawmaking. If only he had Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s patience for minutiae.'b'Zelizer told me that when he began work on the book more than five years ago, \xe2\x80\x9cI still had a kind of view of Johnson, as many do, as someone who really knew how to work the system. What\xe2\x80\x99s surprising to me is that as conditions in Congress change, he is really shut down. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect the last part of the book: a president who\xe2\x80\x99s really emasculated and can\xe2\x80\x99t get anything done even though he\xe2\x80\x99s trying the same old tricks. It really became crystal clear to me how Congress determines the fate of the presidency.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Republicans currently control both chambers, and have a House majority bigger than before. That bodes disastrously for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s legislative dreams, and it\xe2\x80\x99s the point of reference for his impulse to wield executive authority.'b'Zelizer said that instances over the last 50 years of a president truly imposing his will on a Congress fully or partly controlled by the opposing party are rare. Ronald Reagan got tax cuts in 1981 despite a Democratic majority in the House, but he\xe2\x80\x99d just shellacked Jimmy Carter in the 1980 elections and Democrats were running scared.'b'Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s name is popping up a lot now. This year is the 50th anniversary of many of the laws grouped under the Great Society, and the movie \xe2\x80\x9cSelma\xe2\x80\x9d is 'b'drawing complaints'b' for its portrayal of Johnson as resistant to voting rights for blacks and sharply antagonistic to King.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fair to Johnson,\xe2\x80\x9d Zelizer told me.'b'But in his view, Johnson has been considered too kindly by writers who attribute the Great Society to his wizardry.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was cagey, he was smart, he was politically savvy,\xe2\x80\x9d Zelizer said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain why the bills passed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And Obama can indeed be cold and disengaged. But, Zelizer said, that\xe2\x80\x99s not why he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t scaled the legislative heights that Johnson did.'b'Johnson benefited from \xe2\x80\x9ca vibrant period for grass-roots mobilization as a result of the civil rights movement,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that there was pressure for legislation from the bottom up, which is most effective.'b'There hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been any commensurate mobilization during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency. Zelizer said that voters frustrated with congressional inertia should examine their own exertions \xe2\x80\x94 and the ways in which campaign financing, lobbying and gerrymandering have created a dysfunctional legislative branch \xe2\x80\x94 as much as any president\xe2\x80\x99s character.'b'Zelizer\xe2\x80\x99s read on things leaves ample room for Obama to be questioned on foreign policy and for not making more of his first two years, when Democrats controlled Congress. It\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that he should have made less of them, that 'b'delaying health care'b' would have spared Democrats their 2010 drubbing and given him additional time with a friendly(-ish) Congress.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable that we treat our presidents as larger than life, simplifying the stories we tell. They\xe2\x80\x99re not always mighty frigates parting the waters. They\xe2\x80\x99re just as much buoys on the tides of history, rising and falling with the swells.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Film Casts Johnson as Villain, Restarting Civil Rights Debate'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 1), about criticism of a film that depicts President Lyndon B.

What\xe2\x80\x99s made this possible is a string of supportive federal court rulings following the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s pivotal 2013 decision striking down provisions of the Defense of Marriage Act \xe2\x80\x94 the 1996 federal law that denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples.'b'Judge Robert Hinkle of Federal District Court in Tallahassee cleared the way for the Florida breakthrough 'b'with a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day'b' clarification of an earlier ruling in August in which he declared the state\xe2\x80\x99s same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional. The clarification said that clerks in all 67 Florida counties were required to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.'b'The first Florida county to allow same-sex weddings was Miami-Dade, where a state judge, Sarah Zabel, lifted her own temporary injunction, and, fittingly enough, proceeded to officially marry two of the six couples who had sued the county over the marriage ban. The rest of the state began legalizing same-sex marriages just after midnight on Tuesday. All clerk offices agreed to comply with Judge Hinkle\xe2\x80\x99s order, although, disappointingly, some said they would stop performing marriages altogether so that staff members who objected to same-sex unions would not have to officiate them \xe2\x80\x94 an infuriating but probably not unconstitutional act of defiance.'b'Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor and marriage-equality opponent who may make a run for the Republican presidential nomination, reiterated his longstanding belief that the decision on whether to allow same-sex marriages should be left to the states.

The election in November of Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado provides a template for the party on how to succeed in a battleground state with two ascendant constituencies: well-educated social liberals and increasingly assertive Hispanic voters.'b'Gardner prevailed by jettisoning most of his own conservative baggage. A hard-core loyalist of the right during his service in the state legislature from 2005 to 2010 and as a congressman for two terms, Gardner won a tough election against the Democratic incumbent Mark Udall by 'b'shifting left'b' on both immigration and social issues like 'b'abortion and contraception'b'.'b'These maneuvers did not cost Gardner support from the 'b'Republican Party'b' base. 'b'Exit poll data'b' reveals that Gardner did as well or better with core party voters than other recent Republican statewide candidates.'b'Colorado, a rapidly growing swing state, is a testing ground for competing partisan and ideological strategies. Obama 'b'carried the state twice'b' but so did George W. Bush. Republicans currently control the 'b'State Senate'b' by one seat, 18-17; Democrats have a slim majority in the 'b'State House'b', 34-31.'b'Colorado has a sizeable college-educated population: 'b'37 percent'b' of those 25 and older in Colorado have a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree or higher, compared to 28.8 percent nationwide. Just over 'b'one out of five'b' Coloradans is Hispanic, 21 percent, compared to 17.1 percent nationally.'b'Running statewide for the first time after representing largely conservative rural voters, Gardner radically altered his ideological self-positioning.'b'He abandoned his past opposition to liberal immigration policies. On June 5, Gardner 'b'declared his support'b' for giving undocumented immigrants who serve in the armed forces a path to citizenship. On Aug. 1, Gardner cast 'b'one of only 11 House Republican votes'b' in favor of an Obama administration program granting work permits to immigrants brought here illegally as children.'b'Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s most dramatic shift was to 'b'publicly renounce'b', on March 21, his own sponsorship, as a member of the House, of an anti-abortion constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood\xe2\x80\x9d amendment. That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t all. On Sept. 2, he announced his 'b'support for making oral contraceptives 'b'available over the counter without a prescription \xe2\x80\x93 a 'b'tactic adopted'b' by several successful Republican candidates.'b'In the House, he 'b'sponsored'b' bipartisan water infrastructure legislation and 'b'formed'b' a rural broadband coalition \xe2\x80\x93 the type of policies that the 'b'Tea Party'b' wing of the Republican Party exists to oppose.'b'How well did these methods serve Gardner? The Colorado Senate contests of 2010 and 2014, both of which took place during Republican \xe2\x80\x9cwave\xe2\x80\x9d elections, provide the basis for a nearly ideal comparison of different Republican general election strategies. In 2010, Michael Bennet, a Democrat with no elective experience who had been appointed to the Senate a year earlier, ran against Ken Buck, a county prosecutor and an unwavering conservative. Buck, unlike Gardner, remained an orthodox conservative.'b'The results: in 2010, Bennet defeated Buck 854,685, 48.1 percent, to 824,789, 46.4 percent; in 2014, 'b'Gardner defeated Udall'b' 983,891, 48.21 percent, to 944,203, 46.26 percent. Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s victory is all the more impressive because the state\xe2\x80\x99s population grew by over 300,000 from 2010 to 2014, 'b'according to state estimates'b'. The major factors driving population growth are Democratic-leaning immigrants from California and the steadily increasing number of Hispanics.'b'Comparing 'b'2010'b' and 'b'2014'b' exit poll data is even more revealing.'b'In 2010, women voted for the Democratic candidate, Bennet, by a 17-point margin, 56-39; in 2014, women voted for Udall by 9 points, 52-43. Self-identified moderates, who cast over a third of the ballots in Colorado, backed Bennet 63-32, but were less enthusiastic about Udall, voting for him 53-36.'b'Perhaps most tellingly, even though Gardner took stands contrary to those of the Christian right, he won self-identified white born-again and evangelical Christians by a bigger margin, 70 points, 83-13, than Buck did at 77-19, despite the fact that Buck had remained loyal to the religious right. At 25 percent of the electorate, white evangelical and born-again Christian turnout was actually higher in 2014 than it was in 2010 (when it was 21 percent).'b'Peter Hanson, a professor of political science at the University of Denver, argued in a London School of Economics 'b'blog'b' post that Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s success signals a decline in the strength of social conservatives.'b'Hanson pointed out that as recently as 1992, Colorado voters approved a 'b'state constitutional amendment'b' outlawing anti-discrimination legislation that protected gays and lesbians.'b'Now, Hanson argued, \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence suggests that the heyday of social conservatism in Colorado is gone, and not coming back anytime soon.\xe2\x80\x9d Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmove to the middle,\xe2\x80\x9d Hanson pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9csignals just how much Colorado voters have changed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The shift to the left in Colorado on social issues that prompted Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s altered stance was demonstrated by the 'b'decisive rejection'b' of an anti-abortion \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood\xe2\x80\x9d state constitutional amendment, by nearly two to one, 64.87 percent to 35.13 percent. Similar language had been rejected by Colorado voters by equally large margins in 2010 and 2008.'b'Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s success indicates that in many swing states, the Tea Party and the Christian right will tolerate tactical apostasy and remain loyal on Election Day. In fact, the 2014 Republican primaries showed how weak the Tea Party had become, even in the South. Establishment Republican Senate candidates beat insurgents from the right 'b'across the board'b' in Texas, Kentucky, South Carolina, North Carolina, Georgia, Kansas, Tennessee, Alaska and Mississippi.'b'The implosion of the Tea Party allows the Republican Party to shelve for the moment harsh deficit reduction policies that conservative analysts like 'b'James Pethokoukis'b' at the American Enterprise Institute viewed as \xe2\x80\x9cthe dodgy austerity economics of the Tea Party G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Despite the lessening of pressure from the populist right, indications are that the Republican leadership will be cautious in its efforts to address the party\xe2\x80\x99s liabilities with the kinds of voters among whom Gardner made incremental gains in Colorado.'b'On Jan. 3,'b' the Washington Post'b' described Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s plans for the 114th Congress. \xe2\x80\x9cOn the things where we agree, the goal will be to make a law, not just put something on [Obama\xe2\x80\x99s] desk.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking towards Republican chances in the 2016 election, McConnell noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe best thing we can do is to not mess up the playing field, if you will, for whoever the nominee ultimately is,\xe2\x80\x9d warning that'b'Unlike Gardner, McConnell is not setting out to confront and subordinate the right wing of his party, but rather signaling that he intends to keep it in check. The current Congress will test the viability of McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to simultaneously achieve three goals. First, to prevent divisive forces from fracturing Republican unity, maintaining the party in a solid position going into the 2016 elections. Second, to restore the Senate itself as a national forum for debate. Third, to enact legislation of key importance to his business base, while \xe2\x80\x93 like Gardner \xe2\x80\x93 tacking toward the center on issues with particular value for public relations.'b'McConnell will have to balance these objectives as he shepherds controversial legislation: the 'b'Keystone XL pipeline'b', 'b'regulation of carbon emissions'b', 'b'tax reform'b', efforts to 'b'gut or weaken Obamacare'b', 'b'proposals to defund'b' immigration initiatives, and so forth.'b'McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s strength lies in his deep understanding of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s institutional practices and his talent for piecing together legislative proposals that resolve seemingly irreconcilable conflicts. In a January 2014 interview with the National Journal, he described his projected course as majority leader:'b'He continued:'b'McConnell and Boehner are both acutely aware that the lesson of recent history is that Republicans will overplay their hand, as they did after both the 1994 and 2010 midterm elections. Neither history nor demography, however, is political destiny. The Republican establishment, armed with the experience of their 2014 primary victories and the demonstrated success of Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s tactics, will struggle to force the party back onto a mainstream course.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked my members to restrain themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d McConnell said in his interview with The Post. His ability to enforce restraint will be tested daily, if not hourly, over the next two years, most often by two Tea Party senators, 'b'Ted Cruz'b' of Texas and Mike Lee of Utah. The outcome of the test of wills between McConnell and Cruz will shape the achievements of the 114th Congress, just as a similar struggle between Speaker 'b'John A. Boehner'b' and Tea Party heroes like 'b'Louie Gohmert'b' will in the House. Taken together, these battles will also provide intelligence about how the Republican Party will approach the 2016 elections.'b'When 18,000 Germans turn out for an anti-immigration 'b'rally in Dresden'b', it is sadly inevitable that the specter of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s past will be invoked, both outside Germany and within. Sadly, because anti-foreigner sentiments are hardly limited to Germany and political parties espousing resentment of foreigners \xe2\x80\x94 especially Muslim refugees and immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 have proliferated all across Europe, reaching even to traditionally welcoming Nordic lands like Sweden, Finland and Denmark.'b'Germany, in fact, has been among the more generous of European countries in giving refuge to victims of violence in other lands, and Chancellor Angela Merkel has been among the more courageous of European leaders in her stand against the anti-foreigner movement.'b'That said, the march in Dresden on Monday organized by the populist movement Pegida, the German acronym for \xe2\x80\x9cPatriotic Europeans Against Islamization of the West,\xe2\x80\x9d is a worrisome manifestation of the vaguely defined sense among many Europeans that their identities, destinies and livelihoods are being somehow threatened by people of different cultures, religions and color.'b'Pegida\xe2\x80\x99s marches have inevitably attracted neo-Nazis, soccer hooligans and assorted far-rightists, but most participants are the same average Europeans whose anxieties and frustrations have also found expression in opposition to the European Union and to globalization.'b'In part because of its Nazi past, Germany has long been liberal in offering asylum. In the past year, it took in about 200,000 asylum seekers, most of them from Iraq and Syria \xe2\x80\x94 the largest intake of any other country in Europe and four times the German total in 2012. Fortunately, the rise of an anti-immigrant movement has not dissuaded the government from its policy. On the contrary, after a similar Pegida-organized march in Dresden in December, Chancellor Merkel used her New Year\xe2\x80\x99s address to strongly urge Germans to keep their distance from such rallies.'b'Admirable as they are, such exhortations will not stop Pegida or other anti-immigrant movements across Europe. Germany and every other European government must find ways to integrate immigrants into their societies and to speak out clearly and firmly against the rise of racism and xenophobia. But there is a limit to what any one government can do to control the flow of people fleeing poverty, war and repression.'b'Given the open or porous borders across the continent, immigration and asylum demand pan-European action. Shiploads of desperate refugees braving the Mediterranean cannot be the sole responsibility of coastal nations like Italy, nor is it fair for some states to accept thousands of asylum-seekers while others shut their borders. At the least, the European Union should sharply increase the funds it earmarks for handling immigration. Beyond that, it has become essential for the union to shape a common policy on asylum. An equitably shared burden should be easier for politicians to defend, and united action on multinational problems is what the European Union is all about.'b'In memory of Cabu, Wolinski, Charb and Tignous.'b'MEXICO CITY \xe2\x80\x94  Cuba has been the epicenter of anti-Americanism in modern Latin America. As a political ideology it was born during the Spanish-American War of 1898, reached its height with the victory of the Cuban Revolution in 1959, and may now, through a singularly courageous move by President Obama, have begun its final decline.'b'The agreement to re-establish diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba will face serious problems: the opposition of conservative American legislators, as well as a tortuous path toward civil and political liberties in Cuba(the recent detention of bloggers trying to expand the range of free speech in Cuba is a bad omen). But acclaim for the agreement is widespread in Latin America. By his historic announcement on Dec. 17, Obama has begun to dismantle one of the most deeply rooted ideological passions of the southern continent.'b'At its distant origins, anti-Americanism had a religious character: a defensive fear on the part of conservative groups and the Catholic Church directed against the penetration of Protestant belief and culture. For Mexico there was the added offense of the 1846-48 American war of territorial aggrandizement. Nevertheless, the Liberals who governed Mexico in the latter half of the 19th century retained an admiration for the United States. Their republican and democratic ideas were stronger than their nationalist sentiments. Something of the same nature was true among progressive elites throughout the continent.'b'But the war of 1898 united the countries of Hispanic America against the United States and basically reconciled them with Spain, from which they had \xe2\x80\x94 Cuba was one exception \xe2\x80\x94 won their independence. As a result of that war, Latin American liberals experienced something similar to many Marxists after the fall of the Berlin Wall. They felt like orphans, while various American writers and intellectuals (like Mark Twain and William James) recognized an irresolvable contradiction between the democratic values on which the United States was founded and the now explicit intentions (as Henry Cabot Lodge said in 1895) that \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the Rio Grande to the Arctic Ocean there should be but one flag and one country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many saw the independence of Cuba secured by the war as merely the conversion of a Spanish colony into an American possession. And it was then that the liberals of Latin America began to converge with Catholics, other conservative groups and socialists in forming a Latin American nationalism centered on militant opposition to the United States.'b'Between 1898 and 1959, with some exceptions, the political, diplomatic and military balance sheet of the United States in Latin America was nothing short of disastrous. In 1913, the American ambassador Henry Lane Wilson plotted with Mexican conservatives to overthrow (and eventually murder) Francisco I. Madero, the first democratically elected president of Mexico, a grim episode that foreshadowed other abuses: landings of the Marines, occupation of territory, support for military coups, and the insistent presence of huge American corporations. In the United States, diplomacy to further the interests of major businesses was seen as normal; to Latin Americans it was an intolerable display of greed.'b'The region reacted with a surge of nationalism, which the conservative American presidents of the period between the world wars treated as a harbinger of communism. Franklin D. Roosevelt, with his Good Neighbor Policy, somewhat corrected the mistaken direction of his predecessors by accepting the Mexican nationalization of its oil resources. But in Cuba, the connections between politics and American business interests remained unbroken and in plain sight. (Indeed, during World War II, Pan-American cooperation with the United States seemed to have its most fertile moment \xe2\x80\x94 with the prominent exception of Argentina.)'b'At the beginning of the Cold War, many Latin American thinkers attributed much of the region\xe2\x80\x99s poverty and inequality to the presence of American interests and saw socialism, expressed in various Marxist varieties, as a legitimate alternative. The United States continued to support authoritarian dictatorships, like the Somoza family business in Nicaragua. America\xe2\x80\x99s claim to be a fount of democratic values lost its credibility.'b'In 1947, the liberal Mexican historian Daniel Cos\xc3\xado Villegas predicted: \xe2\x80\x9cLatin America will seethe with unrest and ... they will be capable of anything, of sheltering and supporting the enemies of the United States and themselves becoming the most bitter of its possible enemies. And then there will be no way to subdue them, or even to frighten them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Cuban Revolution fulfilled this prophecy and opened a new cycle of intense anti-Americanism. Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Alliance for Progress and the conciliatory moves of Jimmy Carter could not counterbalance the bitterness provoked by Republican administrations. C.I.A. involvement in the coup against Salvador Allende in Chile or the crimes of the Reagan administration in the \xe2\x80\x9cdirty wars\xe2\x80\x9d of Central America incited generations of young Latin Americans to emulate Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. The ideological hatred of \xe2\x80\x9cYankee imperialism\xe2\x80\x9d became standard in many universities. The rage thus engendered was the most effective weapon of survival for the repressive and dictatorial Cuban regime.'b'In 1989 the Berlin Wall fell and, surprisingly, democratic governments came to power through the ballot box in various Latin American battlegrounds, notably Chile, Nicaragua and El Salvador. Marxists were orphaned by ideology, and space was opened for liberal and social-democratic governments.'b'Anti-Americanism in the region will never disappear, but it is going out of fashion \xe2\x80\x94 and Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision will certainly further its demise. It had been artificially maintained by the incendiary histrionics of Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez in Venezuela. But it has become more difficult to mask the anachronism of Chavista discourse, directed against the \xe2\x80\x9cempire\xe2\x80\x9d that is the principal client for Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s oil. Only the great obstacle of the American boycott of Cuba has remained as an outmoded and divisive force.'b'In re-establishing relations with Cuba, the United States renounces its \xe2\x80\x9cimperial destiny\xe2\x80\x9d and recovers much of the moral legitimacy needed to uphold the democratic values that led to its foundation (and also of the countries of Latin America). Obama\xe2\x80\x99s action is meant for the good of all the Americas, including the United States. And freedom of expression in Cuba is an absolute necessity for its success. No people or country is an island unto itself. The Castro dynasty has kept Cuba as such for 56 years.'b''b'\n'b'Enrique Krauze 'b' is a historian, the editor of the literary magazine Letras Libres and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cRedeemers: Ideas and Power in Latin America.\xe2\x80\x9d This article was translated by Hank Heifetz from the Spanish.'b''b'After about a year of on-off negotiations between the government of South Sudan and rebels led by its former vice president, Riek Machar, the two sides have yet to make any meaningful progress.'b'The violence first erupted in December 2013 after a power struggle between Mr. Machar and the country\xe2\x80\x99s president, Salva Kiir, which soon plunged the fledgling republic into civil war. Despite signing a cease-fire agreement in January 2014, and again in May, the two sides have continued to attack each other. Tens of thousands of people have been killed, and nearly two million people have been displaced. South Sudan now ranks first on the Fund for Peace\xe2\x80\x99s Fragile States Index.'b'Peace talks mediated by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), the seven-country security organization for East Africa, have stalled. Mr. Machar and Mr. Kiir have agreed in principle to establish a transitional government of national unity, but they disagree over the redistribution of executive powers and what to do with their respective troops. Negotiations have also foundered because of dissension within IGAD itself.'b'IGAD is expected to hold sometime this month a special summit with its members\xe2\x80\x99 heads of state, and possibly other African leaders. This is a chance to break the deadlock in South Sudan: The warring factions and their backers are more strained than ever, and proposing a reasonable compromise, under the threat of economic sanctions, could compel them finally to prioritize peace.'b'South Sudan is a nation of some 60 tribal groups with little experience of self-governance. Since its security forces broke apart, autonomous  militias have proliferated. Many rebel fighters are civilian militias from Mr. Machar\xe2\x80\x99s Nuer tribe. Significant portions of the government\xe2\x80\x99s forces belong to the Dinka tribe. Fighting resumed recently, and with the dry season, it could intensify again.'b'South Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s oil-dependent economy is nearing catastrophe. The production of crude oil has dropped by about 35 percent since the conflict began. That, combined with a drop of roughly 45 percent in global oil prices since the summer, has meant a substantial reduction in the  government\xe2\x80\x99s oil revenues, and enormous fiscal and budgetary pressures.'b'Since South Sudan exports almost nothing aside from oil and imports almost everything else, trade and monetary policy have also been buffeted by falling oil revenues. Access to foreign currency has become extremely limited. The prices of many imported goods have risen. There are shortages of petrol, which must be imported because South Sudan has no refinery.'b'Yet if these economic strains are a source of instability, they are also an opportunity for IGAD to use economic pressure to broker a peace deal.'b'So far the group has been ineffectual. Djibouti, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya and Somalia have remained mostly neutral in the conflict, but the Ugandan Army has fought alongside Mr. Kiir\xe2\x80\x99s forces while Sudan allegedly supports Mr. Machar\xe2\x80\x99s rebels. Uganda and Sudan are longstanding rivals and have a habit of fighting by proxy.'b'But these spoilers\xe2\x80\x99 interests may now be shifting. The crisis is threatening to further shut down oil production in South Sudan, which would mean more losses of revenue for both South Sudan and Sudan, through which the oil is exported. The flow of imports from Uganda into South Sudan is also impaired. These economic difficulties come at an especially bad time for the presidents of Sudan and Uganda, both of whom face elections within the next two years. Now IGAD as a whole has more incentive to find a compromise between Mr. Kiir and Mr. Machar.'b'The two sides have  agreed to create a new post of prime minister for Mr. Machar. But while the Kiir camp proposes making the new prime minister a nonexecutive member of the cabinet, leaving all executive powers with the president, the Machar camp has argued for turning the presidency into a ceremonial position and abolishing the post of vice president. This deadlock could be broken, however, by reallocating more powers still. Mr. Kiir could be put in charge of the army, the intelligence services and foreign policy, for example, and Mr. Machar in charge of the police and economic policy. Mr. Kiir could be empowered to make judicial appointments after consultations with Mr. Machar.'b'Another point of contention has been what to do with fighters. The government has offered to reintegrate into the security forces former members who defected, but not the civilian militias backing Mr. Machar. The rebels have been wanting both sides to maintain separate armies under separate commands.'b'Considering the fractious tribalism of South Sudan, neither option will do. A fundamental transformation of the security sector is needed; it must become a professional service that reflects the country\xe2\x80\x99s diversity. All fighters who belonged to the army before Dec. 15, 2013, should be reintegrated, regardless of their persuasion. The elderly, the wounded and the illiterate should be discharged with retirement packages. Fighters who joined either side since Dec. 15, 2013, should be considered as applicants to the army, and screened partly with an eye to creating ethnic and regional balance within the corps.'b'IGAD should urge the warring parties to accept these compromises under the threat of punitive action. Sanctions are often decried as ineffectual, but in this case, they stand a good chance of working. South Sudan is now dangerously dependent on Uganda and Kenya for food, on Sudan for exports of oil, and on Kenya for imports of fuel. An embargo on either oil or fuel would undermine Mr. Kiir\xe2\x80\x99s and Mr. Machar\xe2\x80\x99s patronage networks. Leaders in both camps have enriched themselves through corruption, and since some of this wealth is hidden  in IGAD countries, it could easily be identified, frozen and confiscated.'b'So far, South Sudan\xe2\x80\x99s warring factions have been insensitive to humanitarian appeals that they resolve the conflict. It\xe2\x80\x99s time for IGAD to test how sensitive they are to economic pressure.'b''b'\n'b'Peter Biar Ajak,'b' founder of the Center for Strategic Analysis and Research in Juba, is a Ph.D. candidate at Trinity College, University of Cambridge.

For him, free expression was nothing without the right to offend. And Charlie Hebdo has been an equal-opportunity offender: Muslims, Jews and Christians \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention politicians of all stripes \xe2\x80\x94 have been targets of buffoonish, vulgar caricatures and cartoons that push every hot button with glee.'b'In 2006, Charlie Hebdo reprinted controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that originally appeared in a Danish newspaper. In 2011, the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s offices were firebombed the day after it published a special issue guest-edited, it said, by Muhammad called \xe2\x80\x9cCharia Hebdo\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a play on the word in French for Shariah law. The cover of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s issue poked fun at the French novelist Michel Houellebecq, whose newest book imagines France as an Islamic state in the year 2022.'b'There are some who will say that Charlie Hebdo tempted the ire of Islamists one too many times, as if coldblooded murder is the price to pay for putting out a magazine. The massacre was motivated by hate. It is absurd to suggest that the way to avoid terrorist attacks is to let the terrorists dictate standards in a democracy.'b'This is also no time for peddlers of xenophobia to try to smear all Muslims with a terrorist brush. It is a shame that Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front party, which has made political gains stoking anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim fears, immediately sought political advantage with talk of \xe2\x80\x9cdenial and hypocrisy\xe2\x80\x9d about \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic fundamentalism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Hollande has wisely appealed for national unity. His sentiments were echoed by former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who asked the public to avoid the temptation to \xe2\x80\x9clump together\xe2\x80\x9d terrorists with Muslims, and he called for a united front against terrorism. Dalil Boubakeur, the rector of the Grand Mosque in Paris, expressed his community\xe2\x80\x99s anguish over the attack. He did not mince words: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a deafening declaration of war,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Just days after the 9/11 attacks, an editorial in the newspaper Le Monde declared: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d In France, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Je suis Charlie'b'\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI am Charlie\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 has gone viral as the words to show solidarity with the victims at Charlie Hebdo. This attack was an assault on freedom everywhere. On Wednesday, the American Embassy in Paris put that message on its social media accounts.'b'The French satirical newspaper 'b'Charlie Hebdo'b' skewers people of all faiths and backgrounds. One cartoon showed rolls of toilet paper marked \xe2\x80\x9cBible,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTorah\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cQuran,\xe2\x80\x9d and the explanation: \xe2\x80\x9cIn the toilet, all religions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet when masked gunmen 'b'stormed Charlie Hebdo\xe2\x80\x99s offices'b' in Paris on Wednesday with AK-47s, murdering 12 people in the worst terror attack on French soil in decades, many of us assumed immediately that the perpetrators weren\xe2\x80\x99t Christian or Jewish fanatics but more likely Islamic extremists.'b'Outraged Christians, Jews or atheists might vent frustrations on Facebook or Twitter. Yet it looks as if Islamic extremists once again have expressed their displeasure with bullets.'b'Many ask, 'b'Is there something about Islam that leads inexorably to violence, terrorism and subjugation of women?'b''b'The question arises because fanatical Muslims so often seem to murder in the name of God, from the 2004 Madrid train bombing that killed 191 people to the murder of hostages at a 'b'cafe in Sydney'b', Australia, last month. 'b'I wrote last year'b' of a growing strain of intolerance in the Islamic world after a brave Pakistani lawyer friend of mine, Rashid Rehman, was murdered for defending a university professor falsely accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad.'b'Some of the most systematic terrorism in the Islamic world has been the daily persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, from the Bahai to the Yazidi to the Ahmadis.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the oppression of women. Of the bottom 10 countries in the 'b'World Economic Forum'b'\xe2\x80\x99s gender gap report, I count nine as majority Muslim.'b'So, sure, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strain of Islamic intolerance and extremism that is the backdrop to the attack on Charlie Hebdo. The magazine was firebombed in 2011 after a cover depicted Muhammad saying, \xe2\x80\x9c100 lashes if you\xe2\x80\x99re not dying of laughter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Earlier, Charlie Hebdo had published a cartoon showing Muhammad crying and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to be loved by idiots.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Terror incidents lead many Westerners to perceive Islam as inherently extremist, but I think that is too glib and simple-minded. Small numbers of terrorists make headlines, but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t representative of a complex and diverse religion of 'b'1.6 billion adherents'b'. My Twitter feed Wednesday brimmed with Muslims denouncing the attack \xe2\x80\x94 and noting that fanatical Muslims damage the image of Muhammad far more than the most vituperative cartoonist.'b'The vast majority of Muslims of course have nothing to do with the insanity of such attacks \xe2\x80\x94 except that they are disproportionately the victims of terrorism. Indeed, the Charlie Hebdo murders weren\xe2\x80\x99t even the most lethal terror attack on Wednesday: A'b' car bomb'b' outside a police college in Yemen, possibly planted by Al Qaeda, killed at least 37 people.'b'One of the things I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned in journalism is to beware of perceiving the world through simple narratives, because then new information is mindlessly plugged into those story lines. In my travels from Mauritania to Saudi Arabia, Pakistan to Indonesia, extremist Muslims have shared with me their own deeply held false narratives of America as an oppressive state controlled by Zionists and determined to crush Islam. That\xe2\x80\x99s an absurd caricature, and we should be wary ourselves of caricaturing a religion as diverse as Islam.'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s avoid religious profiling. The average Christian had nothing to apologize for when Christian fanatics in the former Yugoslavia engaged in genocide against Muslims. Critics of Islam are not to blame because an anti-Muslim fanatic 'b'murdered 77 people'b' in Norway in 2011.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s also acknowledge that the most courageous, peace-loving people in the Middle East who are standing up to Muslim fanatics are themselves often devout Muslims. Some read the Quran and blow up girls\xe2\x80\x99 schools, but more read the Quran and build girls\xe2\x80\x99 schools. The Taliban represents one brand of Islam; the Nobel Peace Prize winner 'b'Malala Yousafzai'b' the polar opposite.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a humbling story, perhaps apocryphal, that 'b'Gandhi was once asked'b': 'b'What do you think of Western civilization? 'b'He supposedly responded: 'b'I think it would be a good idea.'b''b'The great divide is not between faiths. Rather it is between terrorists and moderates, between those who are tolerant and those who \xe2\x80\x9cotherize.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Australia after the hostage crisis, some Muslims feared revenge attacks. Then a wave of non-Muslim Australians rose to the occasion, 'b'offering to escort Muslims'b' and ensure their safety, using the hashtag #IllRideWithYou on Twitter. More than 250,000 such comments were posted on Twitter \xe2\x80\x94 a model of big-hearted compassion after terror attacks.'b'Bravo! That\xe2\x80\x99s the spirit.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s stand with Charlie Hebdo, for the global outpouring of support has been inspiring. Let\xe2\x80\x99s denounce terrorism, oppression and misogyny in the Islamic world \xe2\x80\x94 and everywhere else.

When I was assigned to the Fugitive Division of the New York City Police Department, in the \xe2\x80\x9990s, I would get out of bed at 3 o\xe2\x80\x99clock each morning, trying not to wake my wife. I would gently kiss her goodbye and leave for work. By 5 a.m. my team and I would be executing the first of several warrants assigned to us for the day. (Mornings are the best time to catch bad guys.) We were arresting the most wanted and dangerous criminals in the city, and the work was, to put it mildly, stressful. By 9 a.m. we would be back in our office processing our arrests, and I would call my wife without fail, in case she had overslept, and to let her know that I was O.K. and still in one piece.'b'Years later, during a tearful venting, my wife confided that those calls were seldom needed to wake her because she was usually lying in bed, tossing and turning and fearing that she would get another kind of call. She couldn\xe2\x80\x99t rest until she had word that I was off the streets and safe for another day. I accepted the dangers of police work because I loved doing it and understood its value to society, but I sometimes regret having dragged her into the life with me.'b'The murders of Officer Liu and his partner, Officer Rafael Ramos, have hit me and my fellow officers especially hard, in ways that may be difficult for civilians, and certain politicians, to fully comprehend. During my 20 years on the job (I retired in 2003), I attended far too many funerals for cops killed in the line of duty. They were all sad and wrenching affairs. But this is different. Getting killed while, say, investigating an armed robbery \xe2\x80\x94 as almost happened on Monday to two New York City police officers in the Bronx \xe2\x80\x94 is something all cops know can occur, and we accept it. But the killing of Officers Liu and Ramos was a coldblooded assassination.'b'These brave men were shot without warning, sitting in their patrol car while looking for crime, something every cop on the street does every day. They were like two shepherds guarding their flock, and they were brutally murdered for it.'b'This act has unleashed a torrent of anger and grief among the members of the Police Department, who take these vile murders personally, and a heartening outpouring of sympathy from ordinary New Yorkers, who instinctively grasp what it has meant at a moment when the police feel demonized, demoralized and, at times, literally under assault. But not everyone is so understanding. The gestures of protest by many officers toward Mayor Bill de Blasio \xe2\x80\x94 including turning their backs to him when he appeared at both officers\xe2\x80\x99 funerals \xe2\x80\x94 have been characterized in some quarters as squandering the credibility of the department and reeking of self-pity.'b'When I hear this sort of thing, my blood pressure goes through the roof. Mr. de Blasio is more than any other public figure in this city responsible for feelings of demoralization among the police. It did not help to tell the world about instructing his son, Dante, who is biracial, to be wary of the police, or to publicly signal support of anti-police protesters (for instance, by standing alongside the Rev. Al Sharpton, a staunch backer of the protests). If there is any self-pity involved, which I doubt, it is only because we lack respect from our elected officials and parts of the media. It has taken two dead cops for some people to take a step back and realize what a difficult job cops have.'b'Most cops I know feel tired of being pushed to do more and more, and then even more. More police productivity has meant far less crime, but at a certain point New York began to feel like, yes, a police state, and the police don\xe2\x80\x99t like it any more than you do. Tremendous successes were achieved in battling crime and making this city a much better place to live and work in and visit. But the time has probably come for the Police Department to ease up on the low-level \xe2\x80\x9cbroken-windows\xe2\x80\x9d stuff while re-evaluating the impact it may or may not have on real, serious crime. No one will welcome this more than the average cop on the beat, who has been pressed to find crime where so much less of it exists.'b'Unfortunately this will require a mayor with far more finesse and political savvy and credibility with law enforcement than Mr. de Blasio appears to have. His statement on Monday that the New York City Police Department is the greatest in the world came too late. He should have been acknowledging our accomplishments months ago, instead of aligning himself with grandstanding opportunists. His words and actions before the killings of Officers Liu and Ramos showed a contempt for the police all too common on the left, and it is this contempt that the officers who have turned their backs to him are responding to.'b'But New York City must be governed and its citizens protected, and that means that the Police Department and the mayor will have to find a way to get along. The divide between us is now vast and bitter. For the healing to begin, Mr. de Blasio must find a way to sound like he actually means it when he compliments us and to follow that up with concrete actions that demonstrate respect and true understanding.'b'Until then he\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to be speaking to a lot of backs in blue.'b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94 IN September 2012, the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, defying the advice of the French government, 'b'published'b' several 'b'lewd caricatures'b' of the Prophet Muhammad.'b'I was in Tunis that week. There were tanks and soldiers outside the mosques, and graffiti in English, French and Spanish calling for revolution, declaring war on the West and all those who hated Islam. A few days earlier the United States Embassy in Tunis had been 'b'attacked'b', and the American School burned down. And shortly before that, the American ambassador to Libya had been 'b'murdered'b' by a jihadist militia.'b'I spent a tense half-hour on the Avenue Habib Bourguiba, trying in vain, as a lone and very visible European, to hail a taxi before the curfew took effect. I cursed Charlie Hebdo for its willful and unnecessary provocations over the years: In 2006, the newspaper reprinted cartoons mocking Muhammad that had first appeared in a Danish newspaper, and in 2011, its offices were 'b'firebombed'b' after it published a spoof issue, \xe2\x80\x9cCharia Hebdo,\xe2\x80\x9d a play on the word for Shariah law.'b'But, like everyone else in Paris, where I live, I was shocked to the core when I heard about the 'b'killings'b' of 12 people at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a 20-minute walk from my own office,\xc2\xa0on Wednesday\xc2\xa0morning.'b'I first became aware that something was wrong when I noticed heavily armed police officers and soldiers at every corner and cars being towed by military vehicles. I stopped for coffee on the Rue de Grenelle and everybody was talking at once and staring at the TV as it showed footage of the massacre, in which two police officers were killed, as well as the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s editorial director, St\xc3\xa9phane Charbonnier, and several cartoonists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is just another stage,\xe2\x80\x9d the guy next to me said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnother stage in what?\xe2\x80\x9d I said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe war against the Arabs,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.'b'It has to be said that Charlie Hebdo is an unlikely victim of such unjustified violence. For most Parisians these days, the magazine is a quaint relic of the \xe2\x80\x9960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s that has long since lost its power to shock. Only the day before the killings, I had noticed on a newsstand a recent front cover of the magazine that showed a goofy-looking Virgin Mary giving birth to an even goofier-looking Christ. I shrugged and walked on, reflecting on how few people read the magazine these days, how it had only just begun to overcome its money troubles, and what a museum piece it had become.'b'To some extent, this was reflected in the ages of two prominent figures who were killed: the brilliant and much-loved cartoonists Jean Cabut (or Cabu) and Georges Wolinski were, respectively, 76 and 80. Most important, they belonged to the generation of May 1968 \xe2\x80\x94 the generation that had revolted against the heavy hand of Charles de Gaulle\xe2\x80\x99s paternalism with a belief in unlimited liberty, unrestrained sexual behavior, drug taking and, above all, the freedom to mock all forms of moral and religious authority.'b'Charlie Hebdo\xe2\x80\x99s relentless pursuit of provocation\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 or \xe2\x80\x9cla provoc\xe2\x80\x9d in slangy French \xe2\x80\x94 belongs to a very Parisian tradition. It dates to before the French Revolution, when it was termed \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x99esprit frondeur,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cslingshot wit.\xe2\x80\x9d (A \xe2\x80\x9cfronde\xe2\x80\x9d was a catapult used to hurl stones at the king in times of insurrection.)'b'What also made Charlie Hebdo, founded in 1970, so French was a militant, aggressive secularism. This again is an old tradition in French culture \xe2\x80\x94 historically, a way of policing the power of the Catholic Church. May \xe2\x80\x9968 was also the revolt of the young against the old, and anti-religious satire a key part of that revolt.'b'But in contemporary France, the young rebels of \xe2\x80\x9968 have long since become the cultural establishment, even if they still espouse the leftist and libertarian ideals of their younger days. Charlie Hebdo, for all its vaunted anarchism, has been a member of the establishment for a very long time.'b'Or at least this is how the magazine is viewed out in the banlieues \xe2\x80\x94 the enormous and often wretched suburbs that surround all major French cities and that are home to a huge immigrant population, mainly from former French colonies in the Middle East, Africa and Asia. What is seen in the center of Paris as tweaking the nose of authority \xe2\x80\x94 religious or political \xe2\x80\x94 is seen out in the banlieues as the arrogance of those in power who can mock what they like, including deeply held religious beliefs, perhaps the only part of personal identity that has not been crushed or assimilated into mainstream French society.'b'What was gunned down on Wednesday in Paris was a generation that believed foremost in the freedom to say what you like to whomever you like. Parisians pride themselves on what they call \xe2\x80\x9cgouaille,\xe2\x80\x9d a kind of cheeky wit, based on free thinking and a love of provocation, that always stands in opposition to authority.'b'The awful killings are the direct opposite of all that: the merciless massacre of the Parisian mind.'b''b'Samuel A. Alito Jr.'b' may be the least recognizable of 'b'Supreme Court'b' justices. I doubt if one American in a thousand could pick him out of a lineup. Those who do know the name, if not the face, of the 64-year-old justice most likely lump him with the other conservatives who as a bloc dominate the Roberts court.'b'But to the political right, and to a degree that has escaped general attention, Sam Alito is much more than just a face in the conservative crowd. He\xe2\x80\x99s something special. He is a rock star \xe2\x80\x94 and not only for 'b'his headline appearances'b' at gatherings of the conservative Federalist Society. He is the redemption of the promise that failed a quarter-century ago, when John H. Sununu, chief of staff to President George H.W. Bush, assured worried conservatives that the president had selected a hole-in-one Supreme Court nominee: 'b'David H. Souter'b'.'b'Conservatives are confident that unlike Chief Justice 'b'John G. Roberts Jr.'b', who committed the unpardonable sin of saving the Affordable Care Act, Sam Alito will never go soft in the crunch. Unlike Justice 'b'Anthony M. Kennedy'b', he is utterly reliable. (Will Justice Alito vote for a right to 'b'same-sex marriage'b', as Justice Kennedy is widely expected to do? Not on your life.) Unlike Justice 'b'Antonin Scalia'b', whose rhetorical excesses yield diminishing returns these days (his perfervid dissent in the 2013 'b'Defense of Marriage Act case'b' has been widely cited by lower court judges as demonstrating that the constitutional basis for a right to same-sex marriage is now beyond debate), Sam Alito is never bombastic. And he avoids the self-indulgent eccentricity that has rendered Justice Clarence Thomas a nonplayer.'b'In the November issue of the religious journal 'b'First Things'b', Prof. Michael Stokes Paulsen, describing Justice Alito as the \xe2\x80\x9cman of the hour,\xe2\x80\x9d accurately labeled him \xe2\x80\x9cthe most consistent, solid, successful conservative on the court,\xe2\x80\x9d adding: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are louder talkers, flashier stylists, wittier wits, more-poisonous pens, but no one with a more level and solid swing than Justice Samuel Alito.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Professor Paulsen of the University of St. Thomas School of Law in Minneapolis didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean to imply that Justice Alito shines only by comparison with imperfect colleagues. In conservative eyes, Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s merit is not relative but absolute. He delivers: not only in the big cases, like 'b'Hobby Lobby'b' last June, in which he wrote the majority opinion upholding the right of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s religious owners to an exemption from the federal mandate to include contraception coverage in their employee health plan, but also in less visible moves that don\xe2\x80\x99t get much public attention but that speak powerfully to the base.'b'It sounds discordant to suggest that a Supreme Court justice has a base, but Sam Alito has one. One of several recent hagiographic articles in the right-wing press was one in the 'b'American Spectator'b' back in May, describing Samuel Alito as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the noblest men in American public life today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This month marks the start of Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s 10 year on the Supreme Court. He took his seat on Jan. 31, 2006, chosen by President George W. Bush to succeed Justice Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor and confirmed by a vote of 58 to 42 after a feeble Democratic 'b'filibuster'b' effort collapsed. The Alito-for-O\xe2\x80\x99Connor substitution was the most consequential change on the court since the first President Bush picked Clarence Thomas to replace Justice 'b'Thurgood Marshall'b' in 1991. None of the six subsequent departures (in addition to Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, they were Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, and Justices Souter and John Paul Stevens) produced anything like the ideological lurch caused by the replacement of a moderately conservative compromise seeker with a lifelong movement conservative. In 1985, a 35-year-old Samuel Alito 'b'applied for a job'b' in the Reagan Justice Department with an essay asserting that as a teenager in the 1960s, \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest influences on my views were the writings of William F. Buckley Jr., the National Review, and Barry Goldwater\xe2\x80\x99s 1964 campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave to others a detailed examination of Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s nine years on the court. Rather, my purpose is to look not specifically at his jurisprudence but at the increasingly distinctive role he is carving out for himself inside the institution. Of course, those are not completely distinct inquiries: The record informs the role. A former federal prosecutor, he is probably the most pro-prosecution member of a pro-prosecution court. During the past two terms, in the 19 criminal cases on which the court was divided, Justice Alito voted least often for the defendant: once. (In that case, 'b'Abramski v. United States'b', he dissented from a decision that upheld a conviction for making a false statement in connection with buying a gun, a violation of the Gun Control Act of 1968.)'b'I mentioned earlier that Justice Alito plays an inside game. It takes several forms. One is his role in shaping the court\xe2\x80\x99s docket, which in turn plays a major role in setting the country\xe2\x80\x99s legal agenda. The Supreme Court cultivates an image as a passive recipient of the legal issues that people deposit on its doorstep. That\xe2\x80\x99s true, except when it\xe2\x80\x99s not. Some issues reach the court by subtle or not so subtle invitation, when a justice sends a signal that a particular agenda isn\xe2\x80\x99t well served by the case at hand but could be advanced by a better one.'b'Justice Alito, one of the most anti-labor justices to serve on the Supreme Court since the New Deal, is currently using this technique to solicit challenges to the survival of public-sector unions. First in 'b'Knox v. Service Employees International Union'b' two years ago, and most recently last June in 'b'Harris v. Quinn'b', he has invited anti-union forces to bring the court a case that could serve as a vehicle for overturning 'b'Abood v. Detroit Board of Education'b', a 38-year-old precedent under which public employees who refuse to join the union can nonetheless be required to pay the portion of union dues that cover the expenses of collective bargaining. The perfect case hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet reached the court \xe2\x80\x94 neither of the two recent cases quite did the job \xe2\x80\x94 but, not surprisingly, the pipeline is filling up with potential candidates.'b'Another inside move is what I\xe2\x80\x99ll call a straight play to the base. Here\xe2\x80\x99s an example for which I can think of no other explanation. It dates back to 2009, when the court unanimously overturned a writ of 'b'habeas corpus'b' that a federal appeals court had granted to an inmate on Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s death row. The issue was evidently so clear to all nine justices that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t bother to set the case for argument, instead simply ruling on the basis of the state\xe2\x80\x99s petition. The unsigned opinion, 'b'Bobby v. Van Hook'b', rejected the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his legal representation at sentencing fell below minimal constitutional standards.'b'The anonymous justice who wrote the opinion observed that the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers appeared to have fully complied with the 'b'American Bar Association'b'\xe2\x80\x99s standards for capital representation that were in effect at the time of the trial; the lawyers did all they might have been expected to do. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not a case,\xe2\x80\x9d the court maintained, in which powerful mitigating evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been apparent from documents any reasonable attorney would have obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As an example of the opposite kind of case, a case in which defense lawyers fell glaringly short of their professional obligations, the court offered the analysis contained in a 2005 Supreme Court decision, 'b'Rompilla v. Beard'b'. That case was one of the final decisions of the Rehnquist court, a rare win for a death-row defendant. By a vote of 5 to 4, with Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor in the majority, the court held that an appeals court had been wrong when, finding the lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior acceptable, it overturned the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s grant of habeas corpus. As it happened, the 'b'appeals court decision'b' had been written by Samuel Alito, then a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.'b'Back to the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in the Ohio case: Justice Alito joined the unanimous unsigned opinion, but something clearly set him off. Maybe it was the court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to the Rompilla case, but protocol left him with nothing he could say about that. In any event, he turned on the American Bar Association, an establishment outfit if there ever was one (Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. had been its president, and Chief Justice Roberts spoke at its annual meeting last August) but long a target in some conservative circles for the progressive views the organization has occasionally stumbled onto. Despite having received its highest rating of \xe2\x80\x9cwell qualified\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of his Supreme Court nomination, Justice Alito is clearly bothered by the A.B.A. \xe2\x80\x94 bothered a lot. In a one-paragraph concurring opinion, he sort of explained.'b'He was joining the court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, he said, but writing separately to \xe2\x80\x9cemphasize my understanding that the opinion in no way suggests that the American Bar Association\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases have special relevance in determining whether an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s performance meets the standard required by the Sixth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The A.B.A, he added, was \xe2\x80\x9ca private group with limited membership.\xe2\x80\x9d (The 400,000-member association, neither exclusive nor limited, is in fact open to all lawyers, and non-lawyers as well, and is actively trying to grow the 'b'membership'b'.) Justice Alito continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the responsibility of the courts to determine the nature of the work that a defense attorney must do in a capital case in order to meet the obligations imposed by the Constitution, and I see no reason why the A.B.A. guidelines should be given a privileged position in making that determination.\xe2\x80\x9d No other member of the court signed onto his opinion. But one or more justices may think twice before offering a garland to the A.B.A. in the future and thus provoking another outburst.'b'Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s disdain for organizations of professionals isn\xe2\x80\x99t limited to the American Bar Association. The Supreme Court ruled in 2002 that the execution of an intellectually disabled defendant amounts to cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The decision, 'b'Atkins v. Virginia'b', left open the question of how to identifyintellectual disability. Last May, in 'b'Hall v. Florida'b', the court ruled by a vote of 5 to 4 that Florida\xe2\x80\x99s definition, a fixed cut-off IQ score of 70 or less, was too rigid to meet constitutional standards. Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s majority opinion cited a brief from the American Psychological Association asserting that an IQ score alone could fail to capture severe deficits in a person\xe2\x80\x99s functional abilities. \xe2\x80\x9cIn determining who qualifies as intellectually disabled, it is proper to consult the medical community\xe2\x80\x99s opinions,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Kennedy wrote.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot follow the court\xe2\x80\x99s logic,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Alito objected, striking a populist tone in his dissenting opinion. \xe2\x80\x9cUnder our modern Eighth Amendment cases, what counts are our society\xe2\x80\x99s standards \xe2\x80\x94 which is to say, the standards of the American people \xe2\x80\x94 not the standards of professional associations, which at best represent the views of a small professional elite.\xe2\x80\x9d The judgment was for legislatures, he said, not for courts and not for doctors.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ll conclude by describing a recent intervention of Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s in a case that is still playing out at the court. The incident received almost no attention. It\xe2\x80\x99s so odd that I\xe2\x80\x99ll just explain what has happened so far rather than try to characterize it.'b'On Oct. 27, an 'b'emergency appeal'b' reached the court on behalf of an inmate on Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s death row, scheduled for execution at midnight the next day. The inmate, Mark A. Christeson, was convicted of a gruesome triple murder of a woman and her two children, committed in 1998 when he was 18 years old. After his conviction became final in the state courts, the Federal District Court in Missouri appointed two lawyers to represent him in filing a habeas corpus petition. But the lawyers, Eric Butts and Phil Horwitz, neglected to meet with him for 11 months and missed the filing deadline by 117 days. The district court then dismissed the untimely petition.'b'Mr. Christeson now wants a team of lawyers from Saint Louis University School of Law to represent him in trying to refile the habeas corpus petition, but the original lawyers have refused to turn over their files or give up their appointment. The question for the Supreme Court, in the petition filed by the new lawyers, is whether the district court should be required to make the substitution in the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the Supreme Court, each justice has administrative responsibility for one or more of the 13 federal appellate circuits. Justice Alito is the \xe2\x80\x9ccircuit justice\xe2\x80\x9d for his old court, the Third Circuit, as well as for the Eighth Circuit, which includes Missouri. In this capacity, on the morning of Oct. 28, Justice Alito issued an order to the Saint Louis Law School team to file a supplemental brief \xe2\x80\x9cregarding whether the record shows\xe2\x80\x9d that the inmate had authorized them to seek substitution as his lawyers.'b'With the scheduled execution hours away, the lawyers, Jennifer A. Merrigan, John R. Mills and Joseph J. Perkovich, were momentarily stymied. The information Justice Alito demanded wasn\xe2\x80\x99t contained in the \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d of the case. Nor would similar information be found in the record of any case. A record doesn\xe2\x80\x99t deal with legal representation. Legal ethics experts I spoke with couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s demand was unprecedented, but they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t recall another one like it.'b'Ordinarily, the terms of a representation between lawyer and client are protected by attorney-client privilege. The Saint Louis lawyers solved the problem by obtaining a waiver of the privilege from their client, who in August had signed a three-page representation form. The lawyers attached the form to their brief.'b'Hours later, the court granted Mr. Christeson a stay of execution, to last while the justices consider whether to hear his appeal. If the court denies his petition, the stay will terminate. If the justices accept the case for argument, the stay will continue until the court issues a decision. Justice Alito, along with Justices Scalia and Thomas, dissented without explanation from the order granting the stay.'b'The justices have now taken up the case, 'b'Christeson v. Roper'b','b'for consideration at five weekly closed-door conferences, an unusual development that almost certainly means that somebody is writing something. Some number of justices may be trying to resolve the case summarily, without hearing argument. Or perhaps the majority judgment is to deny the petition, and three justices are circulating a dissent aimed at persuading a colleague to cast the fourth vote necessary to hear a case. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how soon the mystery, let alone the case, might be resolved; the justices are scheduled to take it up again on Friday, their first conference back from a four-week recess. One thing seems all but certain. If the court eventually rules in the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s favor, Justice Alito will dissent.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a new year in Washington, and I cannot tell you how harmonious things are looking.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of common ground for bipartisan compromise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harry Reid, the new Senate minority leader. Well, not in person. Reid fell off an exercise machine at his house last week and he\xe2\x80\x99s staying home until he no longer looks as if he was pummeled on his way to the cafeteria.'b'The Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 second in command, Dick Durbin, promised that the Democrats would be \xe2\x80\x9ca much better minority\xe2\x80\x9d than the Republicans were. Meanwhile, the new majority leader, Mitch McConnell, promised to end Reid\xe2\x80\x99s dictatorial tendencies and make the Senate \xe2\x80\x9can engine for bipartisan achievement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'McConnell and Reid both have a talent for depressing, cranky oratory. However, McConnell did interject a moment of levity when he suggested that the current rather remarkable strength of the American economy was because of consumer ebullience over the election of a Republican majority in the Senate.'b'Anyhow, everybody in the Senate vowed to improve on last year\xe2\x80\x99s performance. Then they instantly launched into a debate on the Keystone XL oil pipeline.'b'Was this what you were hoping for, people? I know polls show the majority of Americans support the oil pipeline, which when completed would run from Canada to the Gulf. I have also seen polls that show Americans like steak cooked medium and want Rex Ryan to be coach of the Atlanta Falcons. But nobody said either one should be the 'b'top national priority'b'.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the rush? The pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s not going anywhere until a Nebraska court case gets worked out. And oil futures are currently down to around $50 a barrel, while the Canadian pipeline oil needs to sell for about $85.'b'Well, there are reasons. Passing the bill would make a lot of political donors happy. It would give senators a chance to demand that the United States, which became the No. 1 oil producer in the world during the Obama administration, do something about energy independence. It\xe2\x80\x99s a chance to talk about jobs, even though the actual permanent employment created by the pipeline would be about as large as the opening of a new highway tollbooth.'b'Most important of all, the bill has a number of Democratic supporters, allowing orators to use the word \xe2\x80\x9cbipartisan\xe2\x80\x9d about 20 times a minute.'b'Meanwhile, in the very same new spirit of amity, House Speaker John Boehner assured the members that they would march into the future \xe2\x80\x9con common ground, both in letter and in spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d This was right after his re-election. Yes, John Boehner is once again speaker of the House! Perhaps this was not on the top of your new-year wish-list either.'b'The Republican alternatives included Representative Ted Yoho, the large-animal veterinarian from Florida who once argued that the Affordable Care Act was \xe2\x80\x9cracist\xe2\x80\x9d because it includes a tax on tanning beds. Another candidate was Representative Louis Gohmert of Texas, who warned that Muslim extremists were sneaking pregnant women into the United States to give birth to babies who \xe2\x80\x9ccould be raised and coddled as future terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d The rebel who got the most support, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida, was nominated by Steve King of Iowa, the guy who complained about young undocumented immigrants with \xe2\x80\x9ccalves the size of cantaloupes because they\xe2\x80\x99re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy door is always open,\xe2\x80\x9d the triumphant Boehner told the House. Then he added: \xe2\x80\x9cNow don\xe2\x80\x99t get carried away with this, all right?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We appreciate that attitude in Boehner. Also, we appreciate him refusing to back up Yoho when Yoho claimed the speaker had agreed with his theory about tanning beds.'b'On the other hand, Boehner stayed behind the majority whip, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, who was re-elected despite the revelation that when he was a state legislator in 2002, he gave a speech to members of a white supremacy group. \xe2\x80\x9cI know what\xe2\x80\x99s in his heart,\xe2\x80\x9d said the speaker.'b'How do you feel about this one? Scalise said the appearance was a mistake, and it is true that many politicians could make a speech before an assembly of cabbages without noticing that there was anything unusual about the room. On the other hand, in 2004, Scalise was one out of only six people in the 104-member Louisiana House to vote against making Martin Luther King Day a state holiday.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that when we look back on the 114th Congress we don\xe2\x80\x99t remember that the high point was John Boehner beating out Ted Yoho. In fact, a truly cynical mind might wonder if the whole rebellion wasn\xe2\x80\x99t staged by Boehner partisans just to show how horrific the alternative was.'b'Boehner partisans, however, expressed dismay at the lack of team unity. \xe2\x80\x9cI just think it\xe2\x80\x99s disrespectful to the conference, and it\xe2\x80\x99s politically immature,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma. \xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to be talking about Keystone ...\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Patrick Lynch, the president of New York City\xe2\x80\x99s largest police union, has once again 'b'called on Mayor Bill de Blasio to apologize'b' to the police officers.'b'But this raises a real question: Apologize for what? Is the current tiff between the police and the mayor really just about protests and officers killed, or is it about something much bigger: diverging philosophies of basic fairness, the acquisition and application of power, and the structures of oppression demanding submission?'b'Should de Blasio apologize for running an \xe2\x80\x9canti-police campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d as the former police commissioner Ray Kelly put it, because as a candidate he promised to reform New York City\xe2\x80\x99s utterly immoral stop-and-frisk program?'b'The New York Civil Liberties Union characterized the program this way:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn analysis by the NYCLU revealed that innocent New Yorkers have been subjected to police stops and street interrogations more than 5 million times since 2002, and that black and Latino communities continue to be the overwhelming target of these tactics. Nearly nine out of 10 stopped-and-frisked New Yorkers have been completely innocent, according to the NYPD\xe2\x80\x99s own reports.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Or should the police unions apologize for 'b'seeking to retain the policy'b' even after a federal judge found that it violated the constitutional rights of minorities, calling it a \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy of indirect racial profiling\xe2\x80\x9d and bashing the city\xe2\x80\x99s leadership for its complicity, writing:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI also conclude that the city\xe2\x80\x99s highest officials have turned a blind eye to the evidence that officers are conducting stops in a racially discriminatory manner.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The judge, 'b'The New York Times reported'b' at the time, cited statements that then Mayor Bloomberg and Kelly made defending the policy.'b'Should de Blasio apologize for confessing that he told his biracial son to be cautious during interactions with the police, saying \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of a history that still hangs over us, the dangers he may face, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had to literally train him, as families have all over this city for decades, in how to take special care in any encounter he has with the police officers who are there to protect him\xe2\x80\x9d?'b'Or should Lynch apologize for the outrageously inflammatory blaming of the mayor and protesters for the murders of the two police officers, 'b'saying'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is blood on many hands, from those that incited violence under the guise of protest to try to tear down what police officers did every day. That blood on the hands starts on the steps of City Hall in the office of the mayor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Who is to apologize for the poor form of hundreds, possibly thousands, of petulant police officers in using their fallen colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 funerals to demonstrate a political grievance?'b'And who is to apologize to the family of Eric Garner? Who is to apologize to all of the Eric Garners 'b'and'b' the Erica Garners? Do their lives not deserve honoring, remembering, some modicum of justice?'b'And to broaden the scope, who is to apologize for bias in policing in general, and generations of racially biased criminal justice, both of which have contributed to mass incarceration?'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t only about where the apologies should begin, but where they should end.'b'Sure, we can search for ways to rationalize behaviors and responses, talking about personal choices, culture, crime and family structures, but those discussions mustn\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x94 can\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x94 separated from the context of history and the confines of institutional structures.'b'Lift that rock and all sorts of uncomfortable things come crawling out \xe2\x80\x94 a privilege made possible by plunder and oppression, intergenerational transfers of hopelessness bred by intergenerational societal exclusions \xe2\x80\x94 truly ugly things.'b'We have to decide what racial conciliation should look like in this country. Does it look like avoidance and go-along-to-get-along obsequiousness, or does it look like justice and acknowledgment of both the personal parts we play and the noxious structural bias enveloping us?'b'How is mutual understanding achieved without mutual respect being given and blame taken?'b'How do we reconcile ourselves to one another without the failures of the systems that govern us being laid bare before us?'b'It seems to me, in the New York standoff, that the mayor owes no apology for fighting to overturn stop-and-frisk, disclosing that he talked to his son about encounters with police officers, or being compassionate to protesters. That is the man New Yorkers elected.'b'This, to my mind, is an attack on him as an agent of change. It is a battle to see which arm has the most muscle: the one that wants to deny bias, explicit or implicit, in the exercise of its power while simultaneously clinging to that bias; or the one committed to questioning the power and acknowledging the bias. Eventually, we will have to wrestle with the question of which of those forces must win for us to be true and whole.'b'But for short-term expediency, it\xe2\x80\x99s likely that both sides in New York will have to give a little, as a matter of politics more than principle. Everyone will have to swallow as much contrition as they can stomach.'b'That, however, won\xe2\x80\x99t satisfy. Right is a stiff thing, and necessarily so. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take bending well.'b'There are some apologies owed, to be sure, for a legacy of wrongs and present ones, and some of those apologies need to come from the very people demanding them.'b'For all the complaints about the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center over the years \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s too small, too outdated, too gloomy \xe2\x80\x94 it never reported a bat invasion until its ambitious eco-friendly renovation was completed. The center now features a 6.75-acre living green roof, bird protective glass and a new population of insects that bats can\xe2\x80\x99t resist. Five species of bats have unexpectedly been attracted to this new urban habitat on the West Side along with a flurry of bird species like foraging American kestrels, according to delighted watchers at the New York City Audubon Society.'b'The center was once among the deadliest city buildings for migrating birds; fatalities are now down an estimated 90 percent among flocks that used to collide with the old reflective glass but now can better sense the new pixelated glass exterior. And 'b'for all the calls for demolition'b', the center has never seemed more lively, as conventioneers come and go below in sunlight freed through expansive new skylights and glass walls.'b''b'The enormous rooftop carpet'b' of succulent, thirsty sedum plants \xe2\x80\x94 enough to cover more than five football fields \xe2\x80\x94 was designed to soak up millions of gallons of rainwater annually and better insulate the center in winter and summer. Energy consumption should be cut an estimated 25 percent by the green roof and energy-efficient glass designs of FXFowle Architects and Epstein Global. The sedum, a desert transplant, reduces damaging runoff to the city\xe2\x80\x99s overtaxed sewer system and cuts greenhouse gases.'b'Three years ago, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signaled doom for the Javits Center with a plan to replace it with something much bigger in Queens, even as a previously begun renovation went forward. The result is a center that, whatever its limitations, is notably rich in eco-friendly innovations that deserve emulation as the city builds and rebuilds itself into the future.'b'Before it was discredited, a coed\xe2\x80\x99s sensational story alleging gang rape at the University of Virginia prompted the university\xe2\x80\x99s president, Teresa Sullivan, to suspend fraternity and sorority activities on campus so that underlying problems of frat-house excesses could be addressed. The result, announced Tuesday, is an encouraging and realistic agreement by student and university leaders to crack down on the sort of binge drinking and partying abuses that have given frat-house behavior a notorious reputation on campuses across the nation.'b'Under 'b'the agreement'b', at least three \xe2\x80\x9csober and lucid\xe2\x80\x9d fraternity members will monitor behavior at parties where \xe2\x80\x9cjungle juice\xe2\x80\x9d and other potent alcohol punches will be banned along with beer in kegs. Guest lists are to be tightly enforced at the door. One monitor will be in charge of watching frat-house bedrooms with a set of keys to guard against sexual assaults.'b'The agreement does not dwell on the 'b'Rolling Stone rape story'b' that was challenged 'b'in subsequent reporting by The Washington Post'b'. Rather, to the credit of the student body and university, the new code focuses candidly on already well known frat-culture excesses that for too long have invited uncontrolled and even criminal behavior on some campuses. The agreement, in which student fraternity leaders played an important role, is worthy of being used elsewhere.'b'It is important that student leaders played a major role in the process. In a separate statement, the leaders made the point that in allegations of misconduct \xe2\x80\x9cuniversities must demonstrate more respect for the fundamental rights to due process\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 an apparent reference to errors in the rape story that spread widely. For its part, the university stressed the students\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to address \xe2\x80\x9chigh-risk drinking, sexual misconduct and unhealthy power structures\xe2\x80\x9d at fraternity events.'b'Together, the two sides have produced a code of mature behavior to protect what Ms. Sullivan called \xe2\x80\x9cour community of trust.\xe2\x80\x9d It is timely as well: the fraternities\xe2\x80\x99 spring rush for new members begins next week. No one knows better than the university\xe2\x80\x99s students and leadership that the campus will continue to be watched closely to see how closely the code is observed.'b'New York is one of 29 states with a minimum wage that exceeds the meager federal minimum of $7.25 an hour. But, with an hourly minimum of $8.75, rising to $9 next year, it still lags nine states \xe2\x80\x94 including California, Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 and the District of Columbia, which have or soon will have hourly minimums higher than $9.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo says that New York\xe2\x80\x99s minimum is too low. But he is reluctant to face down the restaurant industry and other low-wage employers that oppose an increase. In the November election, he sidestepped that contradiction, saying the way would be paved for a higher minimum if Democrats gained control of the State Senate, but then he barely lifted a finger to help Democrats win.'b'The fact of the matter is that Mr. Cuomo does not need the State Legislature to raise the minimum wage. Under New York law, the state labor commissioner, who is nominated by the governor, can convene a wage board of business, labor and public representatives to recommend changes to the wage rules. The commissioner, who can accept, reject or modify the board\xe2\x80\x99s advice, then issues a decision that becomes a legally binding \xe2\x80\x9cwage order.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For example, a wage board convened in July by Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s labor commissioner, Peter Rivera, is expected to report soon on how much to raise the state minimum wage for restaurant and other tipped food-service workers from the current $5 an hour. The size of the likely raise is unknown, but if the board does not call for raising the tipped wage to the state minimum wage, Mr. Rivera should use his discretion to raise tipped workers to that level. Currently, eight states do not allow a separate, subminimum wage for tipped workers, on the reasonable grounds that customers intend their tips to benefit workers, not to subsidize employers.'b'More broadly, Mr. Cuomo should use wage orders to lift the state minimum wage. Though this hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been done before, there is legal precedent for bold use of wage orders. The tipped wage was raised by wage order in 2011, and, in 1986, a wage order issued under Gov. Mario Cuomo ended the subminimum wage for young workers.'b'In addition, the labor commissioner could use wage orders to raise the minimum wage in New York City, because the law lets the minimum be reviewed and revised as needed by locality.'b'Governor Cuomo has a good tool he could use in the fight for fair wages. He should use it.'b'On Dec. 26, authorities in Azerbaijan raided the local bureau of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, a U.S. government-funded service, seizing computers and ordering the office shut down. Earlier that month, police had  arrested Khadija Ismayilova, a RFE/RL reporter and the country\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent investigative journalist, on dubious charges of inciting someone to commit suicide. (The alleged victim has since recanted the accusation, but Ms. Ismayilova remains in jail.)'b'These events have been reported abroad largely as marking a further constriction in Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s already tiny space for alternative points of view. And they are that. But they also suggest a dramatic change in the geopolitics of the volatile Caspian Sea region: the Azerbaijani government\xe2\x80\x99s growing hostility toward Washington.'b'Azerbaijan is in a prime location, wedged between Russia and Iran on the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea. Since gaining independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, it has been a strong partner of the United States. It has worked with Washington to break Russia\xe2\x80\x99s energy monopoly in the region by supporting the construction of oil and gas pipelines to Turkey. It is a key transit point for military cargo to and from  Afghanistan. And the government in Baku has forged close ties with Israel, based primarily on the trade of weaponry and oil.'b'A 2009 U.S. diplomatic cable described Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy as characterized by \xe2\x80\x9cpragmatism, restraint and a helpful bias toward integration with the West.\xe2\x80\x9d Baku\xe2\x80\x99s orientation toward the West was always in service of two priorities: maintaining its grip on power and taking back the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which Azerbaijan lost to ethnic Armenian separatists in the early 1990s. But as Russia\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic new foreign policy changes the strategic landscape across Eurasia, Baku appears to be recalculating whether its ties to the West really are advancing its own goals.'b"The attack on RFE/RL followed months of extreme anti-Western rhetoric. Top Azerbaijani government officials have accused the United States ambassador to Baku of \xe2\x80\x9cgross interference\xe2\x80\x9d and former Foreign Minister Carl Bildt of Sweden of being an American spy.  In early December, the president's chief of staff, Ramiz Mehdiyev, published a 13,000-word article claiming that the C.I.A. was contriving regime changes in the post-Soviet space (the so-called color revolutions). It also called Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s human rights activists a \xe2\x80\x9cfifth column\xe2\x80\x9d of the United States."b'The dominant criticism is that Washington, acting through NGOs and human rights groups, is trying to destabilize the Azerbaijani government. In fact, human rights activists have criticized American and European governments for being too soft on Baku. Washington has called the raid on RFE/RL merely \xe2\x80\x9ccause for concern.\xe2\x80\x9d In spite of Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s dismal human rights record, it has been awarded prestige projects like the chairmanship of the Council of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Committee of Ministers in 2014, and it will be hosting the European Games this summer.'b'Anti-American rhetoric from Baku is not unheard of, but its recent intensity, seemingly unprompted, and its reliance on Kremlin talking points suggest a shift toward Moscow.'b'Russia has a collective security agreement with Armenia, maintains a large military base there and provides the country with discounted weaponry. It\xe2\x80\x99s never been clear how Russia might intervene in a war between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, but Baku\xe2\x80\x99s repudiation of America makes Russia less inclined to get involved in a fight against Azerbaijan.'b'The United States, for its part, will never intervene militarily on Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s side. And the payoff for Baku  of putting up with Washington\xe2\x80\x99s hectoring on democracy and human rights shrinks as the West loses influence worldwide. It\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of the Azerbaijani government\xe2\x80\x99s disdain of Washington that the raid on RFE/RL was conducted just days after Secretary of State John Kerry spoke with President Ilham Aliyev on the phone.'b'In an interview in December, Ali Hasanov, a top presidential adviser, was asked why the government began to so sharply criticize the United States but not Iran or Russia. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause they don\xe2\x80\x99t criticize us, that\xe2\x80\x99s why,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cRussia, Iran, and China, too, deal with us on the basis of noninterference in our internal affairs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Washington, meanwhile, increasingly judges partner nations according to their opposition to Russia. At her confirmation hearing in September, the new United States ambassador to Uzbekistan \xe2\x80\x94 one of the most repressive governments on the planet \xe2\x80\x94 praised the country as \xe2\x80\x9can increasingly important partner,\xe2\x80\x9d thanks to \xe2\x80\x9cits deliberate, reliable resistance to Russian pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s mimicry of Russian rhetoric and rapprochement with Moscow is an implicit threat to Washington: Give us what we want, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll go over to Russia.'b'The United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to give in to this blackmail. Yes, the stakes are high: As Washington works to isolate Russia economically, Azerbaijani natural gas has become an even more important alternative to Russian gas for European customers. And Baku\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical shift could upset the fragile balance that has kept tensions over Nagorno-Karabakh from turning into a full-scale war.'b'But it would be short-sighted for Washington to sacrifice its principles just to shore up support against Russia. Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s current geopolitical moment is only temporary. While the pro-Russia forces in Baku appear to be ascendant for the time being, other powerful blocs favor closer ties to the West.'b'Failing to stand up for human rights and democracy, including the rights  of its own RFE/RL, would make the United States look weak and sap its supporters. Expecting to be arrested, Ms. Ismayilova herself asked foreign governments to speak loudly in defense of the dozens of political prisoners in Azerbaijan. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in human rights advocacy behind closed doors,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople of my country  need to know that human rights are supported.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\n'b'Joshua Kucera'b' is a journalist and author of The Bug Pit, a blog on military and security issues in Eurasia. 'b''b'Russia has been producing so much bad news of late that a lot of it has passed without notice. The implosion of the Russian currency and the sham trial and questionable sentencing of the Putin opponent Aleksei A. Navalny and his brother Oleg have overshadowed less suspenseful stories \xe2\x80\x94 such as the designation of several nongovernmental organizations as \xe2\x80\x9cforeign agents,\xe2\x80\x9d the departure of the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading economist from his academic post, and new attacks on the remaining scraps of independent media. And those were the latest battles for the hearts, minds and memories of the Russian people.'b'As the year wrapped up, the cabinet filed a bill in Parliament proposing to create a federally mandated list of the broadcasters to be carried by every cable provider. And the person who would be in charge of compiling that list, according to the bill, is the president of Russia.'b'Even before this proposal to enshrine in law a total monopoly on broadcasting, the few independent broadcasters left in Russia were already losing their battles for survival. After Dozhd (Rain) TV, the last independent broadcaster that still aspires to a national reach \xe2\x80\x94 though it has lost most of its cable and satellite carriers \xe2\x80\x94 was forced to abandon its rented studio, it was kicked out of a temporary space; then in December it commenced broadcasting from an apartment. In the Siberian city of Tomsk, TV2, probably the last surviving independent regional broadcaster, went off the air at the end of the year, under pressure from the authorities.'b'A few days before, in Moscow, Yevgenia Albats, the editor of the last independent print magazine, The New Times, was charged with disobeying the police for ostensibly trying to drive away from an officer who had stopped her car. Ms. Albats says she was stuck in traffic and could not have tried to drive away even if she had wanted to; central Moscow was indeed in gridlock all of that evening. Ms. Albats may face arrest if convicted.'b'In other end-of-the-year Moscow news, the economist Konstantin Sonin left his post as provost of the Higher School of Economics, a public university, after just under a year and a half. Mr. Sonin is one of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s small cohort of internationally renowned economists, and after his colleagues Sergei Guriev and Sergei Aleksashenko emigrated in 2013, he became by far the most prominent economist still working in the country. The fact that he held a high post at Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s most prestigious university seemed to signal the university\xe2\x80\x99s continued quality even as other Russian institutions of higher education kept slipping.'b'The president of the Higher School of Economics, Yaroslav Kuzminov, is married to the head of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Central Bank, Elvira Nabiullina, and this connection seemed to offer the university some protection from government meddling. But as the Russian currency tumbled in December, Mr. Sonin may have made one too many statements criticizing the government\xe2\x80\x99s and the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s policies \xe2\x80\x94 and he was promptly forced out of his job.'b'Academic institutions have been under pressure in Russia for years, and nongovernmental organizations have offered many scholars a haven. But at the end of 2014 one leading NGO, the Sakharov Center, which houses a museum of dissidence and sponsors exhibits, research and panels on human rights and history, was declared a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign agent\xe2\x80\x9d by the Justice Ministry. The designation is likely to paralyze the work of the center by imposing back-breaking reporting requirements.'b'The attack on the Sakharov Center came on the heels of a campaign to close the Memorial Society, the country\xe2\x80\x99s oldest history NGO, which documented human rights abuses in the U.S.S.R. and then in post-Soviet Russia. The Memorial Society has dozens of chapters throughout the country and  is proving difficult to kill, but the state has made its intentions clear: Not  only have at least two chapters of the organization been declared \xe2\x80\x9cforeign agents,\xe2\x80\x9d but the Justice Ministry has asked the Supreme Court to order it closed altogether.'b'The onslaught on what remains of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s media, academic institutions and historical groups sends a clear message: The government wants to control not only what people think about current events but also what they think about the past \xe2\x80\x94 and how they think in general. As President Vladimir Putin\xe2\x80\x99s rhetoric has grown more ideological, he has begun relying more heavily on history to make his point and affirm his own legitimacy.'b'His message puts forward a vision of a great Russian Empire under the czars and a great U.S.S.R. under Joseph Stalin and others \xe2\x80\x94 followed by a great Russia under himself.

It seems that investors have finally stopped believing those fairy tales.'b'The euro has been sliding against the dollar for much of the last 12 months and, this week, fell to a 'b'nine-year low'b', after the European Union published depressing economic data. One euro was 'b'trading'b' at $1.1815 Thursday afternoon, down from $1.3588 at the start of 2013. The currency has fallen because of a growing fear among investors that the eurozone \xe2\x80\x94 19 countries \xe2\x80\x94 is stuck in an economic quagmire. Its leaders are not doing much to pull it out.'b'For a time, European leaders like Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany found a convenient excuse in the weakened economies of Greece, Spain, Ireland and Portugal. Their argument went something like this: Europe will rebound once politicians in countries on the \xe2\x80\x9cperiphery\xe2\x80\x9d of the eurozone streamline their systems and reduce their deficits. The nations did much of what was asked: They made severe cuts to public services, pensions and other spending; passed laws to make it easier for companies and governments to fire people; and raised taxes.'b'Some of these peripheral nations are indeed 'b'growing again'b'. But the sacrifices they have been forced to make have come at great cost to them. In Greece and Spain, 'b'unemployment'b' remains very high, at about 25 percent, and 'b'deflation'b', which is defined as a broad decline in consumer prices, has been a reality for months.'b'Meanwhile, the problems of the periphery have metastasized and now even the \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d is faltering. Unemployment has stopped falling and remains high in most eurozone nations. Consumer prices 'b'declined'b' by 0.2 percent in December, the first time they have fallen across the currency union 'b'since 2009'b'. Germany, France and Italy \xe2\x80\x94 its three largest economies \xe2\x80\x94 contracted or barely grew in the second and third quarters of 2014.'b'And there is little reason to expect a quick recovery since the governments of these nations are doing little or nothing to help. A recently announced European Union 'b'investment fund'b', for example, is so small that it will not come close to replacing the drop in government and private capital spending since the crisis. Officials at the European Central Bank, who helped stabilize the eurozone in recent years, have been saying they will do more by, for instance, buying bonds and other assets that would pump money into the economy, but they have not yet 'b'delivered'b'.'b'Given this grim backdrop, the euro\xe2\x80\x99s tumble is to be expected. The Japanese 'b'yen'b' and the British 'b'pound'b' have also slid against the dollar in recent months as their countries\xe2\x80\x99 economies have lagged that of the United States. For Americans, a weaker euro will lower the cost of European vacations, wine and cheese. But the region\xe2\x80\x99s frail economy will reduce demand for American goods and services, undermining the modest recovery here.'b'If anything, the euro\xe2\x80\x99s decline should serve as a mini-economic stimulus because it lowers the cost of goods and services produced in the zone for consumers in the rest of the world. A depreciating currency will, of course, make imports costlier. But that is desirable because inflation is already so low in the eurozone.

Such arrangements would discriminate against smaller companies that have a tough enough time as it is competing against big content providers like Amazon and Netflix.'b'On Wednesday, the chairman of the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, appeared 'b'to endorse'b' a proposal by President Obama that would reclassify broadband service as a telecommunications service, rather than the lightly regulated information service it is now.'b'Reclassifying broadband would allow the commission to prohibit companies like Verizon and Comcast from blocking content on the Internet. It would also allow it to forbid Internet service providers from cutting special deals with companies like Amazon and Netflix to speed up the delivery of some content like movies and TV shows. Such arrangements would hurt smaller businesses that do not have deep pockets to pay for faster delivery.'b'The cable and phone companies and their friends in Congress are opposed to reclassifying broadband. Their main argument is that telecommunications rules are cumbersome and hostile to investments in new technology.'b'Mr. Wheeler has a great comeback. 'b'Speaking at'b' the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, he noted that F.C.C. regulation of cellular phone services has not stopped Verizon and AT&amp;T from investing billions of dollars in their profitable mobile phone businesses. Nor has it stopped the wireless industry from becoming \xe2\x80\x9cmonumentally successful.\xe2\x80\x9d Moreover, the commission\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of the wireless industry has not been onerous. Even though the F.C.C. has classified the industry as a telecommunications service, it has not imposed all the conditions on wireless carriers that it could have.'b'Earlier in 2014, Mr. Wheeler 'b'did not appear'b' inclined to reclassify broadband, fearing court challenges \xe2\x80\x94 which cable and phone companies have brought against even weaker rules in the past. He also seemed to fear pushback from Republicans, who even now are 'b'discussing retaliation'b', perhaps a cutting of the F.C.C.\xe2\x80\x99s budget.'b'Mr. Wheeler said the commission would vote on the issue on Feb. 26. Given the president\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of reclassification, Mr. Wheeler should stick to his guns.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I disagree with the assertion in \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Gene Editors'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Jan. 2) that my company\xe2\x80\x99s previous effort to receive regulatory approval for genetically modified grass was derailed because the grass escaped from a test plot approved by the Agriculture Department. The real issue is that the agency has failed to act on our 2003 petition to deregulate this plant even though the same technology is used in millions of acres of agricultural crops and in foods we eat every day.'b'Today, we\xe2\x80\x99re developing turf grass varieties that will have significant environmental benefits, including less mowing and reduced fertilizer, pesticide and water use. The technology behind these grasses, which is much like traditional grass breeding, is a result of a continued commitment to innovation that addresses consumer needs and environmental concerns.'b'As the article correctly states, this new technology is not subject to regulation by the Agriculture Department. That said, we have been transparent in communicating these plans and the expected benefits to the agency. We remain committed to that level of transparency despite the Agriculture Department\xe2\x80\x99s 12-year refusal to act upon our original petition for deregulation.'b'JIM HAGEDORN'b'\nChairman and Chief Executive'b'\nScotts Miracle-Gro Company'b'\nMarysville, Ohio, Jan. 6, 2015'b''b''b''b'WE all make resolutions and promises to live healthier and better lives, to make the world a better place. Not having my annual physical is one small way I can help reduce health care costs \xe2\x80\x94 and save myself time, worry and a worthless exam.'b'Around 45 million Americans are likely to have a routine physical this year \xe2\x80\x94 just as they have for many years running. A poke here, a listen there, a few tubes of blood, maybe an X-ray, a few reassuring words about diet, exercise and not smoking from the doctor, all just to be sure everything is in good working order. Most think of it as the human equivalent of a 15,000-mile checkup and fluid change, which can uncover hidden problems and ensure longer engine life.'b'There is only one problem: From a health perspective, the annual physical exam is basically worthless.'b'In 2012, the Cochrane Collaboration, an international group of medical researchers who systematically review the world\xe2\x80\x99s biomedical research, analyzed 14 randomized controlled trials with over 182,000 people followed for a median of nine years that sought to evaluate the benefits of routine, general health checkups \xe2\x80\x94 that is, visits to the physician for general health and not prompted by any particular symptom or complaint.'b'The unequivocal conclusion: the appointments are unlikely to be beneficial. Regardless of which screenings and tests were administered, studies of annual health exams dating from 1963 to 1999 show that the annual physicals did not reduce mortality overall or for specific causes of death from cancer or heart disease. And the checkups consume billions, although no one is sure exactly how many billions because of the challenge of measuring the additional screenings and follow-up tests.'b'This lack of evidence is the main reason the United States Preventive Services Task Force \xe2\x80\x94 an independent group of experts making evidence-based recommendations about the use of preventive services \xe2\x80\x94 does not have a recommendation on routine annual health checkups. The Canadian guidelines have recommended against these exams since 1979.'b'How can this be? There have been stories and studies in the past few years questioning the value of the physical, but neither patients nor doctors seem to want to hear the message. Part of the reason is psychological; the exam provides an opportunity to talk and reaffirm the physician-patient relationship even if there is no specific complaint. There is also habit. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to change something that\xe2\x80\x99s been recommended by physicians and medical organizations for more than 100 years. And then there is skepticism about the research. Almost everyone thinks they know someone whose annual exam detected a minor symptom that led to the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, or some similar lifesaving story.'b'One explanation for the ineffectiveness of the annual exam in reducing the death rate is that it does little to avert death or disability from acute problems. Unintentional injuries and suicides are, respectively, the fourth and 10th leading causes of death among Americans. And it does little for chronic conditions without significantly useful interventions such as Alzheimer\xe2\x80\x99s, the fifth leading cause of death among older people.'b'Further, researchers have long noted that screening healthy people who have no complaints is a pretty ineffective way to improve people\xe2\x80\x99s health. If you screen thousands of people, maybe you\xe2\x80\x99ll find tens whose exams suggest they might have a disease. And then upon further tests, you\xe2\x80\x99ll find it is really only a few individuals who truly have something. And of those individuals, maybe one or two actually gain a health benefit from an early diagnosis.'b'The others may have discovered a disease, but one that either would never have become clinically evident and dangerous, or one that is already too advanced to treat effectively. For instance, early detection of most thyroid cancers leads to surgery, but in many cases those cancers would not have caused serious problems, much less death. Conversely, for individuals whose annual exams lead to the diagnosis of esophageal or pancreatic cancer, the early diagnosis might extend the time they know they have cancer but is unlikely to extend their lives.'b'Some are actually hurt by physicals, because healthy patients who undergo an exam sometimes end up with complications and pain from further screening or confirmatory tests.'b'My New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution does not mean I won\xe2\x80\x99t get my annual flu shot or a colonoscopy every 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 or eat a balanced diet and get regular exercise. These are proven to reduce morbidity and mortality. Those who preach the gospel of the routine physical have to produce the data to show why these physician visits are beneficial. If they cannot, join me and make a new resolution: My medical routine won\xe2\x80\x99t include an annual exam. That will free up countless hours of doctors\xe2\x80\x99 time for patients who really do have a medical problem, helping to ensure there is no doctor shortage as more Americans get health insurance.'b'MADISON, N.H. \xe2\x80\x94 A LITTLE before noon on Nov. 18, 1970, a blood-flecked hand pawed the top of the southeast face of El Capitan, the massive, 3,000-foot vertical wall in Yosemite National Park known to climbers as the Dawn Wall. A bearded, wild-eyed man eventually pulled himself up and stumbled back into the realm of horizontal existence after 26 nights lashed to the cliff. Approximately 70 reporters and well-wishers rushed forward to greet him. A dozen TV cameras whirred.'b'In California\xe2\x80\x99s beatnik climbing circles, Warren Harding, who completed the first ascent of Yosemite\xe2\x80\x99s grandest wall that day with his partner, Dean Caldwell, stood out for his penchant for fast sports cars and beautiful women and for his voracious consumption of red wine. When asked why he climbed, he responded, succinctly: \xe2\x80\x9cBecause we are insane.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some years later, Mr. Harding, retired from serious climbing, attended a party in Estes Park, Colo., at the home of Mike Caldwell (no relation to Dean Caldwell), a climber and guide. Mike introduced Mr. Harding to his 5-year-old son, a towhead named Tommy.'b'This week, it is his bloodied hands that are pawing relentlessly toward the summit of the 'b'Dawn Wall'b'. Tommy Caldwell, 36, is poised with a partner, Kevin Jorgeson, 30, to make history by becoming the first to free climb the same face Mr. Harding and Mr. Caldwell conquered.'b'The distinction is that in free climbing, climbers use only their hands, feet, arms and legs to make upward progress \xe2\x80\x94 and not the bolts, pitons and other contrivances Mr. Harding and his partner used, and for which they were criticized. In free climbing, ropes and other equipment are used only to stop a fall.'b'Many climbers consider the Caldwell-Jorgeson effort, begun on Dec. 27, to be perhaps the most difficult free climb ever attempted.'b'The anticipation and spectacle surrounding it \xe2\x80\x94 an adventure that, thanks to cellphones, social media and the Internet, has been shared by millions of people \xe2\x80\x94 surpass anything imaginable in Mr. Harding\xe2\x80\x99s day. And like Mr. Harding\xe2\x80\x99s ascent, this one has not come without some skepticism and bewilderment about all the fuss.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpending two to three weeks on the route, surrounded by camera crews, fixed lines, and other media accoutrements; getting goodies brought up to you by friends... Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t something about all that seem a little out of place in the middle of El Capitan?\xe2\x80\x9d Chris Kalman, a climber, asked this week on his blog, 'b'Fringe\xe2\x80\x99s Folly'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere, I repeat, is the adventure?\xe2\x80\x9d But Mr. Kalman acknowledged in a postscript that he was rooting for them: \xe2\x80\x9c"I\xe2\x80\x99ve got my fingers crossed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although some 13 other full-length routes on El Cap have been free climbed, none of those come close to the sustained level of difficulty the Dawn Wall presents. It took Tommy Caldwell, who has free climbed 11 of those other routes, more than anyone else, seven years to piece together a way up the wall. He methodically explored the sheer face by rappelling down from the top of El Capitan on reconnaissance missions, searching for the tiniest wrinkles in the smooth rock to pull himself upward. He fell hundreds of times while attempting the route\xe2\x80\x99s numerous pitches (a pitch is a segment of climbing less than the length of a rope), though he was caught each time by his rope.'b'The resulting route is a masterpiece. The hardest section, Pitches 14 and 15, involved traversing horizontally across the blankest portion of the wall for more than 300 feet. This required the power and coordination of an Olympic gymnast and the footwork of a ballerina. The potato-chip-thin rock flakes to which Mr. Caldwell clung on this passage left deep lacerations on his fingertips. (As of midday Thursday, Mr. Jorgeson had not completed Pitch 15.)'b'Their climb is in contrast to the ascent by Mr. Harding and his partner. They tenaciously built a ladder up the cliff out of pitons, bolts and nylon slings. Back then, over campfires and in the pages of climbing journals, some of Mr. Harding\xe2\x80\x99s more high-minded peers grumbled that he played up his climbs for media attention and employed a heavy-handed style of ascent, drilling too many holes into the rock for expansion bolts to aid his climb.'b'With enough bolts and patience, critics complained, any piece of rock could be climbed. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like screaming,\xe2\x80\x9d one climber, T. M. Herbert, wrote at the time in The American Alpine Journal. They bolted the thing, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cand they sold it to millions on television!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Technology and the media may bring viewers closer than ever before to these intense endeavors, but in Mr. Harding\xe2\x80\x99s day, they could have the curious effect of dehumanizing both the personalities and the experience. Only Mr. Harding\xe2\x80\x99s real friends knew, for instance, that in truth he remained devoted to but one woman \xe2\x80\x94 his mother. When asked how it felt to see her 46-year-old son high up on the Dawn Wall, making history, she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the longest Warren\xe2\x80\x99s ever been away from home.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Harding died in 2002 at age 77. Now Mike Caldwell checks in regularly with his son for updates by cellphone. Tommy also FaceTimes daily with his wife and young son, Fitz, from the wall.'b'This is a pleasant change from the tales of death and disaster that most often thrust climbing into the news. The climbing community will sort out for itself what techniques are fair, and what\xe2\x80\x99s baloney. The beauty of the endeavor, as Mr. Harding surely would understand, is that ultimately each and every climber gets to define his or her own meaning of adventure.'b'Many of us in the econ biz were wondering how the new leaders of Congress would respond to the sharp increase in American economic growth that, we now know, began last spring. After years of insisting that President Obama is responsible for a weak economy, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say the truth \xe2\x80\x94 that short-run economic performance has very little to do with who holds the White House. So what would they say?'b'Well, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t see that one coming: They\xe2\x80\x99re claiming credit. Never mind the fact that all of the good data refer to a period before the midterm elections. Mitch McConnell, the new Senate majority leader, says that he did it, that growth reflected \xe2\x80\x9c'b'the expectation of a new Republican Congress'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The response of the Democratic National Committee \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHahahahahahaha\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 seems appropriate. I mean, talk about voodoo economics: Mr. McConnell is claiming not just that he can create prosperity without, you know, actually passing any legislation, but that he can reach back in time and create prosperity before even taking power. But while Mr. McConnell\xe2\x80\x99s self-aggrandizement is funny, it\xe2\x80\x99s also scary, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a symptom of his party\xe2\x80\x99s epistemic closure. Republicans know many things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t so, and no amount of contrary evidence will get them to change their minds.'b'At least Mr. McConnell didn\xe2\x80\x99t do what many of his colleagues have done when faced with inconvenient facts: resort to conspiracy theories.'b'Consider, for example, how some Republicans dealt with good news about health reform. Before Obamacare went into effect, they overwhelmingly insisted that it would be a disaster, that more people would lose insurance than would gain it. They were, of course, delighted by the technical problems that initially crippled the program\xe2\x80\x99s website. But those problems were fixed, and enrollment soared. Their response? \xe2\x80\x9cThey are cooking the books,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'declared Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming'b', who now leads the Senate Republican Policy Committee.'b'But that was then. At this point we have multiple independent confirmations \xe2\x80\x94 'b'most recently from Gallup'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that Obamacare has dramatically expanded insurance coverage. So what do they say now? The law \xe2\x80\x9cwill collapse under its own weight,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'says Representative Paul Ryan'b', the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.'b'Speaking of Mr. Ryan: Almost four years have passed since he and many others in his party lambasted Ben Bernanke, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, 'b'for policies that they claimed would lead to high inflation'b' and \xe2\x80\x9cdebase the dollar.\xe2\x80\x9d The inflation never materialized, and the dollar proceeded to strengthen, but Mr. Ryan gave no sign of having been chastened \xe2\x80\x94 and many conservatives, including favorite intellectuals like Niall Ferguson of Harvard, became \xe2\x80\x9c'b'inflation truthers'b',\xe2\x80\x9d insisting that the government is hiding price rises.'b'Oh, and Europe \xe2\x80\x94 whose central bank, unlike the Fed under Bernanke\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, took those inflation warnings to heart and 'b'raised interest rates in 2011'b' \xe2\x80\x94 'b'is now experiencing outright deflation'b', with terrifying implications for its economic and political outlook.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s climate change. It appears that 'b'2014 was the hottest year yet'b', which should close the door on silly claims that global warming has stopped. But it won\xe2\x80\x99t matter to Senator James Inhofe, who now leads a crucial environmental committee and 'b'has long insisted that all the science in this field is a liberal hoax'b'.'b'Now, everyone makes predictions that turn out to have been wrong; it\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated world out there, and nobody\xe2\x80\x99s perfect. The point, however, is that Congress is now controlled by men who never acknowledge error, let alone learn from their mistakes.'b'In some cases, they may not even know that they were wrong. After all, conservative news media are not exactly known for their balanced coverage; if your picture of how health reform is working is based on Fox News, you probably have a sense that it has been a vast disaster, even though the reality is one of success that has surprised even the law\xe2\x80\x99s supporters.'b'The main point, however, is that we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a political subculture in which ideological tenets are simply not to be questioned, no matter what. Supply-side economics is valid no matter what actually happens to the economy, guaranteed health insurance must be a failure even if it\xe2\x80\x99s working, and anyone who points out the troubling facts is ipso facto an enemy.'b'And we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about marginal figures. You sometimes hear claims that the old-fashioned Republican establishment is making a comeback, that Tea Party extremists are on the run and we can get back to bipartisan cooperation. But that is a fantasy. We can\xe2\x80\x99t have meaningful cooperation when we can\xe2\x80\x99t agree on reality, when even establishment figures in the Republican Party essentially believe that facts have a liberal bias.'b'The journalists at Charlie Hebdo are now rightly being celebrated as martyrs on behalf of freedom of expression, but let\xe2\x80\x99s face it: If they had tried to publish their satirical newspaper on any American university campus over the last two decades it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have lasted 30 seconds. Student and faculty groups would have accused them of hate speech. The administration would have cut financing and shut them down.'b'Public reaction to the attack in Paris has revealed that there are a lot of people who are quick to lionize those who offend the views of Islamist terrorists in France but who are a lot less tolerant toward those who offend their own views at home.'b'Just look at all the people who have overreacted to campus micro-aggressions. The University of Illinois fired a professor who taught the Roman Catholic view on homosexuality. The University of Kansas suspended a professor for writing a harsh tweet against the N.R.A. Vanderbilt University derecognized a Christian group that insisted that it be led by Christians.'b'Americans may laud Charlie Hebdo for being brave enough to publish cartoons ridiculing the Prophet Muhammad, but, if Ayaan Hirsi Ali is invited to campus, there are often calls to deny her a podium.'b'So this might be a teachable moment. As we are mortified by the slaughter of those writers and editors in Paris, it\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to come up with a less hypocritical approach to our own controversial figures, provocateurs and satirists.'b'The first thing to say, I suppose, is that whatever you might have put on your Facebook page yesterday, it is inaccurate for most of us to claim, Je Suis Charlie Hebdo, or I Am Charlie Hebdo. Most of us don\xe2\x80\x99t actually engage in the sort of deliberately offensive humor that that newspaper specializes in.'b'We might have started out that way. When you are 13, it seems daring and provocative to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc3\xa9pater la bourgeoisie,\xe2\x80\x9d to stick a finger in the eye of authority, to ridicule other people\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs.'b'But after a while that seems puerile. Most of us move toward more complicated views of reality and more forgiving views of others. (Ridicule becomes less fun as you become more aware of your own frequent ridiculousness.) Most of us do try to show a modicum of respect for people of different creeds and faiths. We do try to open conversations with listening rather than insult.'b'Yet, at the same time, most of us know that provocateurs and other outlandish figures serve useful public roles. Satirists and ridiculers expose our weakness and vanity when we are feeling proud. They puncture the self-puffery of the successful. They level social inequality by bringing the mighty low. When they are effective they help us address our foibles communally, since laughter is one of the ultimate bonding experiences.'b'Moreover, provocateurs and ridiculers expose the stupidity of the fundamentalists. Fundamentalists are people who take everything literally. They are incapable of multiple viewpoints. They are incapable of seeing that while their religion may be worthy of the deepest reverence, it is also true that most religions are kind of weird. Satirists expose those who are incapable of laughing at themselves and teach the rest of us that we probably should.'b'In short, in thinking about provocateurs and insulters, we want to maintain standards of civility and respect while at the same time allowing room for those creative and challenging folks who are uninhibited by good manners and taste.'b'If you try to pull off this delicate balance with law, speech codes and banned speakers, you\xe2\x80\x99ll end up with crude censorship and a strangled conversation. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost always wrong to try to suppress speech, erect speech codes and disinvite speakers.'b'Fortunately, social manners are more malleable and supple than laws and codes. Most societies have successfully maintained standards of civility and respect while keeping open avenues for those who are funny, uncivil and offensive.'b'In most societies, there\xe2\x80\x99s the adults\xe2\x80\x99 table and there\xe2\x80\x99s the kids\xe2\x80\x99 table. The people who read Le Monde or the establishment organs are at the adults\xe2\x80\x99 table. The jesters, the holy fools and people like Ann Coulter and Bill Maher are at the kids\xe2\x80\x99 table. They\xe2\x80\x99re not granted complete respectability, but they are heard because in their unguided missile manner, they sometimes say necessary things that no one else is saying.'b'Healthy societies, in other words, don\xe2\x80\x99t suppress speech, but they do grant different standing to different sorts of people. Wise and considerate scholars are heard with high respect. Satirists are heard with bemused semirespect. Racists and anti-Semites are heard through a filter of opprobrium and disrespect. People who want to be heard attentively have to earn it through their conduct.'b'The massacre at Charlie Hebdo should be an occasion to end speech codes. And it should remind us to be legally tolerant toward offensive voices, even as we are socially discriminating.'b'Score another victory for the sustainable city. New York is 'b'broadly banning'b' expanded polystyrene, the all but unavoidable, near-everlasting plastic foam used in drink cups, food trays, packing peanuts and many, many other things.'b'The ban was passed at the end of Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s administration, in December 2013, but was delayed a year to give the city time to see whether expanded polystyrene could feasibly be recycled and resold.'b'It can\xe2\x80\x99t, Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s administration says \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s too hard to take out of the waste stream and there\xe2\x80\x99s hardly any market for it. Abundant, bulky and cheap, it clogs landfills and takes more or less forever to decompose. Better just to ban it, as other cities like Berkeley, Calif., Seattle and Portland, Ore., have done. The law takes effect July 1, but a grace period on enforcement will put off any fines until next January. Small businesses and nonprofit organizations can apply for an exemption, but this looks like the end of an era of cheap, ubiquitous, disposable foam.'b'Good for Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. de Blasio. We haven\xe2\x80\x99t agreed with all of their high-minded abolition campaigns, like the ones to banish certain sizes of soft drinks and carriage horses that pull tourists. But in this case, there is every good reason to induce businesses to use a food-delivery and packing material better than foam.'b'Expanded polystyrene is not exactly a toxic substance, but it is a noxious one. It has a place in society \xe2\x80\x94 highway departments have used it for years as cheap, lightweight road fill, for example \xe2\x80\x94 but as trash on city streets and in waterways, it is more trouble than it\xe2\x80\x99s worth. In the year ending in June 2014, the city collected 28,000 tons of expanded polystyrene, all of it useless. More disturbing, when it gets into the water, it floats forever. Plastics are a curse of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oceans, swirling in mammoth gyres. Big chunks and tiny bits contaminate the food chain, poison and kill marine life and leave even the remotest beaches looking like garbage dumps.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s already a galaxy of plastic waste out there; New York has wisely decided not to keep adding to it.'b'Anyone who has spent time waiting shoeless on an airport check-in line \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, anyone who flies \xe2\x80\x94 should pay serious attention to the recent revelation that an airline baggage handler was allegedly able to smuggle 153 firearms in an accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s carry-on bag on 17 Delta flights from Atlanta to New York during a seven-month period. The reason, shocking in its simplicity, is that most back-room airport workers are not required to pass through metal detectors on the way to the job.'b'As Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s district attorney, Kenneth Thompson, discovered in arresting five men for gun smuggling last month, this turns out to be a security defect at most airports in the nation. Senator Charles Schumer is now sensibly calling on the Transportation Security Administration to mandate physical screening for all airport workers. Agency officials responded that they would look into whether new safeguards were needed. Now, each airport works out separate security requirements; very few, if any, require physical screening of the full array of workers like airplane cleaners, mechanics and baggage handlers, according to Mr. Schumer. The Atlanta scheme is particularly alarming because it operated for an estimated five years in various airports. \xe2\x80\x9cThey could have easily put a bomb on one of those planes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Thompson 'b'noted'b'.'b'The district attorney described how Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clax gun laws\xe2\x80\x9d allowed the baggage handler to buy weapons online without a background check. The handler carried the guns into work, free from any detector, and used his airport ID to take them through an employee entrance into the secure passenger area. There he would meet his accomplice in a men\xe2\x80\x99s room and exchange guns for cash. The accomplice, previously cleared through check-in, would load up his carry-on and take weapons aboard, even as the pilots and flight crews had to go through detectors.'b'T.S.A. officials conducted a special inspection this week in Atlanta. But in the past they have said that cost and potential disruption of airline operations have argued against the use of metal detectors for all workers. The agency insisted it was alert to insiders\xe2\x80\x99 threats and required regular background and criminal checks on employees. This hardly seemed enough after the backdoor path blazed by the Atlanta gun runners.'b'LOS ANGELES \xe2\x80\x94 The Koch brothers Congress, purchased with the help of about $100 million from the political network of the billionaire energy producers, got down to its first order of business this week: trying to hold off the future.'b'Meanwhile, here on the other coast, one of the most popular politicians in America, Gov. Jerry Brown of California, bounced into his fourth and final term by trying to hasten that future. The contrasts \xe2\x80\x94 East and West, old and new, backward-looking and forward-marching, the beholden and behold! \xe2\x80\x94 could not have been more stark.'b'The 114th Congress is trying to rush through the Keystone XL pipeline to carry oil from the dirty tar sands of Canada to the Gulf Coast. The State Department has estimated that the total number of permanent new jobs created by the pipeline would be 35 \xe2\x80\x94 about the same as the handful of new taco trucks in my neighborhood in Seattle. This, at a time when the world is awash in cheap oil.'b'Governor Brown, having balanced a runaway California budget and delivered near-record job growth in a state Republicans had written off as ungovernable, laid out an agenda to free the world\xe2\x80\x99s eighth-largest economy \xe2\x80\x94 his state \xe2\x80\x94 from being tied to old energy, old transportation and old infrastructure. He doubled down on plans to build a bullet-train network and replumb the state\xe2\x80\x99s water system, while setting new goals to reduce dependence on energy that raises the global temperature.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe challenge is to build for the future, not steal from it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Governor Brown, who is the embodiment of the line about how living well is the best revenge \xe2\x80\x94 political division. He is 76, but said he\xe2\x80\x99s been pumping iron and eating his vegetables of late so he can live to see the completion of the high-speed rail system, about 2030, when Governor Brown would be a frisky 92.'b'Russia, which is ranked below California in overall economic output, is teetering as world commodity prices provide a cold lesson in what can happen to a country tied to the fate of oil\xe2\x80\x99s wild swings. The Republicans should take note. The Keystone pipeline, though largely symbolic in the global scheme of things, does nothing for the American economy except set up the United States as a pass-through colony for foreign industrialists. Well, not all foreign: The Koch brothers are one of the largest outside leaseholders of acres in Canadian oil sands, according to a Washington Post report. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that has nothing to do with the fierce urgency of rushing Keystone XL through Congress now.'b'At the same time, the Republican hold-back-the-clock majority announced plans to roll back environmental regulations. Fighting hard for dirty air, dirty water and old-century energy producers, the new Senate leaders are trying to keep some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s oldest and most gasping coal plants in operation, and to ensure that unhealthy air can pass freely from one state to the other. One strategy is to block money to enforce new rules against the biggest polluters.'b'For intellectual guidance, Republicans can count on 80-year-old Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the incoming chairman of the environment committee. Inhofe calls the consensus scientific view on human-caused warming \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest hoax.\xe2\x80\x9d He plans to use his gavel to hold back regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, fighting the obvious at every turn.'b'The headache, for the rest of us, will come when the nations of the world meet in Paris at year\xe2\x80\x99s end to discuss how to address the problem that knows no nationality. We\xe2\x80\x99ll talk about China and its climate-warming coal plants. Critics will point to the United States, its knuckle-dragging Congress and the industries it is shielding from responsibility.'b'The Republican agenda is frozen in time. It\xe2\x80\x99s all frack-your-way-to-prosperity, and Sarah Palin shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cDrill, baby, drill.\xe2\x80\x9d The problem, of course, is that the world doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need any more oil, not now; the price is down by 50 percent over the last year with no bottom in sight. Cheap petro is killing not just Russia but Iraq, Venezuela, Saudi monarchs and, soon, assorted other dependencies \xe2\x80\x94 like Alaska and Texas. At some point, the only way the Keystone XL can be profitably built and operated is with a huge subsidy from taxpayers.'b'Nature, also, is weighing in. Earthquakes in Texas and Oklahoma are raising alarms about the relationship between the hydraulic byproducts of fracking and the temblors rolling through a huge swatch of land that\xe2\x80\x99s been perforated for oil and gas drillers.'b'Governor Brown and another West Coast governor, Jay Inslee of Washington, view the cheap oil era as a golden opportunity for an energy pivot. Inslee wants to tax the biggest carbon emitters to pay for new infrastructure. The motto is tax what you burn, not what you earn.'b'Governor Brown is quick to note the big forces at play between the West Coast and the pollution panderers along the Potomac. \xe2\x80\x9cCalifornia is basically presenting a challenge to Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters earlier this week.'b'A big piece of that challenge is the $68 billion high-speed rail project, which would zip passengers between San Francisco and Los Angeles in just under three hours. It\xe2\x80\x99s bogged down in legal and financial muck, and critics call it pie in the sky.'b'But Governor Brown is undaunted. What he has going for him is an old strain in the American character, dormant for much of the Great Recession \xe2\x80\x94 the tomorrow gene. There\xe2\x80\x99s no legacy, no long-term payoff, in defending things that are well past their pull point. And, seriously, which would you rather have: a futuristic, clean-energy train, or a pipeline that carries a product produced in a way that makes the world a worse place to live?'b'En f\xc3\xa9vrier 2006, les r\xc3\xa9dacteurs du magazine fran\xc3\xa7ais Charlie Hebdo se r\xc3\xa9unirent pour d\xc3\xa9battre d\xe2\x80\x99un sujet qui aurait des cons\xc3\xa9quences mortelles: devaient-ils ou pas publier les caricatures de Mahomet en couverture de leur prochaine \xc3\xa9dition? Nous \xc3\xa9tions en train de r\xc3\xa9aliser un reportage sur Jean Cabut, plus connu sous le nom de Cabu, l\xe2\x80\x99un des dessinateurs fran\xc3\xa7ais les plus connus. Nous \xc3\xa9tions donc sur place et nous filmions la discussion qu\xe2\x80\x99il menait avec ses coll\xc3\xa8gues de la r\xc3\xa9daction.

A peine neuf ans plus tard, des hommes arm\xc3\xa9s attaquaient une r\xc3\xa9union identique, tuant dix r\xc3\xa9dacteurs et dessinateurs dont trois des personnes que nous avions film\xc3\xa9es: Cabu, Bernard Verlhac (dit Tignous) et Georges Wolinski.'b"Au del\xc3\xa0 de son talent d\xe2\x80\x99artiste, notre ami Cabu \xc3\xa9tait une personnalit\xc3\xa9 qu\xe2\x80\x99on n\xe2\x80\x99oublie pas. Sa coupe \xc3\xa0 la Jeanne d\xe2\x80\x99Arc et ses lunettes \xc3\xa0 la John Lennon \xc3\xa9taient inimitables. Il avait nagu\xc3\xa8re anim\xc3\xa9 des \xc3\xa9mission de t\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa9vision pour enfants, il avait un c\xc3\xb4t\xc3\xa9 gauche, gentil, bienveillant. Nous l\xe2\x80\x99aimions. Mais ce que Cabu aimait par-dessus tout c'\xc3\xa9tait la provocation et le mauvais go\xc3\xbbt, avec cette ironie bien fran\xc3\xa7aise \xe2\x80\x93 politique et vulgaire, tr\xc3\xa8s aiguis\xc3\xa9e. Il \xc3\xa9tait chez lui \xc3\xa0 Charlie Hebdo, il pouvait y afficher sans compromis ses opinions sur les institutions et les dirigeants de tout poil: politiciens, banquiers, flics... et hommes de Dieu."b'Ce jour-l\xc3\xa0, Cabu d\xc3\xa9fendait les dessinateurs du Danemark qui avaient \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 confront\xc3\xa9s \xc3\xa0 une situation identique en septembre 2005. Le journal danois Jyllands-Posten avait publi\xc3\xa9 12 dessins consid\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9s blasph\xc3\xa9matoires par de nombreux musulmans. Les gouvernements des pays arabes avaient officiellement protest\xc3\xa9, des manifestations avaient eu lieu de par le monde, faisant 200 morts. Charlie Hebdo d\xc3\xa9cida de reproduire la s\xc3\xa9rie enti\xc3\xa8re des dessins dans son num\xc3\xa9ro du 8 f\xc3\xa9vrier.'b'En filmant cette r\xc3\xa9union tristement historique entre Cabu, le r\xc3\xa9dacteur en chef et les \xc3\xa9ditorialistes, nous ne pouvions nous douter de l\xe2\x80\x99importance du moment auquel nous assistions. Nous f\xc3\xbbmes \xc3\xa9blouis par l\xe2\x80\x99esprit de collaboration, de cr\xc3\xa9ativit\xc3\xa9 et de joie dans lequel furent choisies la couverture et la l\xc3\xa9gende, la caricature habile de Mahomet par Cabu, le visage cach\xc3\xa9 par ses mains pour \xc3\xa9viter d\xe2\x80\x99enfreindre la r\xc3\xa8gle interdisant de montrer l\xe2\x80\x99image du proph\xc3\xa8te, qui restait provocante malgr\xc3\xa9 tout.

Les menaces de mort ne tard\xc3\xa8rent pas \xc3\xa0 affluer \xc3\xa0 son encontre, mais son humour et son optimisme demeur\xc3\xa8rent intactes. Notre ami Cabu a \xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 assassin\xc3\xa9. Aujourd\xe2\x80\x99hui, il nous manque.'b'In February 2006 the editors of the French magazine Charlie Hebdo met to discuss a matter of what turned out to be deadly consequence: Would they publish a satirical image of Muhammad on their cover? We were making a documentary about Jean Cabut, known as Cabu, one of the most famous cartoonists in France. So we were there, filming his conversation with his colleagues as they chose the cover. The issue that came out of this meeting \xe2\x80\x94 with a Cabu cartoon on the cover and the images they discussed here \xe2\x80\x94 turned out to be one of the most popular in the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s history. Almost nine years later, gunmen stormed this very meeting and killed 10 editors and cartoonists, including three of the people in this film: Cabu, Bernard Verlhac (known as Tignous) and Georges Wolinski.'b'Beyond his talent as an artist, our friend Cabu was a formidable character \xe2\x80\x94 his Joan of Arc haircut and John Lennon-style round glasses were inimitable. A former children\xe2\x80\x99s television host, he was goofy, kind, sweet. We loved him. But what Cabu loved was provocation and bad taste: a very French \xe2\x80\x94 political and vulgar, yet sharp \xe2\x80\x94 type of irony. He was right at home at Charlie Hebdo, where he could take uncompromising stands on institutions and leaders of all stripes: politicians, bankers, cops \xe2\x80\xa6 and men of God.'b'In this case, Cabu was supporting cartoonists in Denmark who had just grappled with the same issue in September 2005. The Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten had published 12 cartoons considered blasphemous by many followers of Islam. Arab governments protested officially; there were clashes at protests and demonstrations around the world, leading to more than 200 deaths. Charlie Hebdo had decided to reproduce the complete set of cartoons for its Feb. 8 issue.'b'In filming Cabu\xe2\x80\x99s now historic meeting with his editor in chief and fellow cartoonists and editorialists, we could not know that we were capturing on camera such an important moment. We were just amazed by the collaborative, creative, joyful process that led to the cover and caption, Cabu\xe2\x80\x99s drawing of the Prophet Muhammad, cleverly hiding his face with his hands to avoid breaking outright prohibitions on showing the prophet\xe2\x80\x99s likeness, but still provocative. Provocative enough to apparently serve as the root of this week\xe2\x80\x99s attack.'b'As the cartoon was published, police officers were assigned for Cabu\xe2\x80\x99s protection. As the death threats against him soon poured in, his humor and high spirits remained intact. Our friend Cabu was murdered. Today, we miss him.'b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94 Wednesday was the day when Michel Houellebecq\xe2\x80\x99s latest novel, \xe2\x80\x9cSoumission\xe2\x80\x9d (Submission), hit the bookstores. It has been all Houellebecq all the time lately, as shrewd marketing from his publishing house made sure that this provocative book on France becoming an Islamic republic in 2022 would get prime-time coverage \xe2\x80\x94 and draw maximum controversy.'b'So Wednesday began with Mr. Houellebecq on morning radio, explaining that, contrary to what he said in 2010, Islam is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe dumbest religion\xe2\x80\x9d after all, and that there is \xe2\x80\x9cspace for negotiation.\xe2\x80\x9d Asked whether his novel was intended to scare people, he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThe scariest part of the novel is actually the part before the Muslims come to power.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To Mr. Houellebecq, the \xe2\x80\x9cterrifying degree of contempt\xe2\x80\x9d in which, in his view, politicians, judges and journalists are now held in France, is much scarier than electing a decent Muslim president.'b'Mr. Houellebecq\xe2\x80\x99s light and, at the same time, terribly serious comments were still resonating when, three hours later, two heavily armed men entered the newsroom of Charlie Hebdo and perpetrated the worst massacre Paris has witnessed in decades, killing 12 people. It soon became clear that the attackers had acted to punish those free spirits who not only dared to publish, almost 10 years ago, the cartoons of Muhammad printed in a Danish newspaper that had sparked deadly protests, but never backed down after.'b'So much for \xe2\x80\x9cspace for negotiation.\xe2\x80\x9d A nation in shock soon forgot Mr. Houellebecq\xe2\x80\x99s niceties about the advantages of \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d Radical Islam had taken over the news. Again.'b'An American colleague has asked me whether the attack on Charlie Hebdo was comparable to 9/11. There is a big difference: While this attack came as a shock to the French because of the target and the high number of casualties, it did not come exactly as a surprise. We have been living with this threat for a long time now.'b'We have witnessed other hideous terrorist crimes, like Mohammed Merah\xe2\x80\x99s killing of seven people, including three children at a Jewish school, three years ago in three separate attacks in southwestern France. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had journalists and NGO workers kidnapped and assassinated in Syria and Africa. We know that the involvement of French armed forces in the fight against Al Qaeda and the Islamic State in Africa and the Middle East \xe2\x80\x94 an involvement that enjoys broad popular support \xe2\x80\x94 makes us a target for revenge. We are wary of the success of the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s recruiting campaigns in our mosques, which have sent more than 1,000 young French jihadis to the Syrian and Iraqi battlegrounds.'b'Yet we also have a big, quiet and nonradicalized Muslim community living among us. Islam is the second religion in France, behind Catholicism. France is home to the biggest Muslim community in Europe, as well as the biggest Jewish community. So in order to try to keep everybody reasonably happy together, we have promoted secularism, giving way to a new motto: Libert\xc3\xa9, \xc3\xa9galit\xc3\xa9, fraternit\xc3\xa9, la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9.'b'This is the country where Muslim girls and Jewish boys can\xe2\x80\x99t wear a veil or a yarmulke in public schools. Or where a couple is politely asked to leave if the woman declines to uncover her fully veiled face, as required by the law, during a performance of \xe2\x80\x9cLa Traviata\xe2\x80\x9d at the Paris Op\xc3\xa9ra. It does not make us popular in the Arab world, but somehow it works at home: Muslim schoolgirls attend classes unveiled, and the couple left the Op\xc3\xa9ra without protesting.'b'But France is also the country of Charlie Hebdo. The 45-year-old satirical newspaper is quintessentially French, in its provocative irreverence, its not-so-tasteful yet very witty humor, its refusal to spare any taboo. The popularity of its cartoonists \xe2\x80\x94 the ones who were sprayed with bullets on Wednesday \xe2\x80\x94 extended well beyond Charlie Hebdo. They had created legendary characters for teenagers\xe2\x80\x99 comic books and the gray pages of enlightened newspapers; they were regular guests on TV.'b'But the eccentric team at Charlie Hebdo stubbornly stood its ground when it started to receive threats after publishing the Muhammad cartoons. In 2011, after another devastating front page headlined \xe2\x80\x9cCharia Hebdo,\xe2\x80\x9d the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s offices were destroyed in an arson attack. The journalists moved over temporarily to Lib\xc3\xa9ration, then to new offices. Unbowed, however, they did not change a thing, giving equal treatment to rabbis, priests, imams, sports figures and politicians.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt may sound a bit pompous, but I\xe2\x80\x99d rather die standing than live on my knees,\xe2\x80\x9d the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s editor, St\xc3\xa9phane Charbonnier, who was known as Charb, told Le Monde two years ago. On Wednesday, he died standing.'b'In a moving tribute on French TV, Robert Badinter, a former justice minister who led the fight to abolish the death penalty in 1981, said that these cartoonists, our beloved bad boys, were \xe2\x80\x9ctrue heroes\xe2\x80\x9d because they had been \xe2\x80\x9csoldiers of freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is why the French are in shock. This is not blind terrorism. It is terrorism targeted at the heart of the French identity: Mohammed Merah targeted Jewish schools and Muslim immigrants who had joined the French Army because they were symbols of our diversity. The attackers on Wednesday targeted Charlie Hebdo because it is a symbol of our freedom.'b'So what should we do, torn between \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate Islam\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cradical Islam\xe2\x80\x9d? How should we deal with Islam? The attack on Charlie Hebdo \xe2\x80\x9cis not only a crime, it is a trap,\xe2\x80\x9d warned Mr. Badinter. The trap, of course, is to confuse the two. Just like Marine Le Pen, the leader of the National Front, who immediately stoked fears of \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic fundamentalism\xe2\x80\x9d as if it applied to the whole French Muslim community, and as if it were the principal issue.'b'We are obsessed with the rise of Islam. Like Mr. Houellebecq, French intellectuals can debate Islam and secularism for hours. \xe2\x80\x9cLe Suicide Fran\xc3\xa7ais\xe2\x80\x9d (The French Suicide) \xe2\x80\x94 a book by \xc3\x89ric Zemmour, a political essayist whose views have been compared to those of Ms. Le Pen \xe2\x80\x94 has topped the best-seller list.'b'Yet we have been unable to have a rational national conversation about integrating Islam into our core values. If there is a lesson to learn from Salman Rushdie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSatanic Verses,\xe2\x80\x9d from the murder in Amsterdam of Theo van Gogh, from the saga of the Muhammad cartoons and from the attack on Charlie Hebdo\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csoldiers of freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d it is that radical Islam can only be fought with the support of moderate Islam.'b'It is a long battle. But we are well- equipped for it, as long as we hold firm to our values. Unbowed. Without taboos. Just like Charlie Hebdo.'b'What being an editorial cartoonist looks like now.'b'SPECIALTY license plates \xe2\x80\x94 which bear the logo of a college or a sports team, or a slogan like \xe2\x80\x9cSave Our Seas\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cStop Child Abuse\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 bring in lots of money for state governments, as well as the schools, nonprofit groups, professional organizations and other entities that sponsor them. But these vehicular tags have also become a new frontier in debates over freedom of speech.'b'The United States Supreme Court is hearing a 'b'lawsuit'b' by the 'b'Sons of Confederate Veterans'b'. It wants Texas to issue a specialty plate showing the Confederate battle flag, which a state panel rejected. The group argues that if Texas allows plates that express some opinions, it also must allow the battle flag, even if the symbol offends many people. Anything less, the group says, amounts to discrimination against its viewpoint, in violation of the First Amendment.'b'A similar 'b'case'b' from North Carolina might also go up to the 'b'Supreme Court'b'. In 2011, the State Legislature 'b'approved'b' a specialty plate with the slogan 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChoose Life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Those who seek this specialized plate pay $25, $10 of which goes to the state\xe2\x80\x99s highway fund and $15 of which goes to a pregnancy counseling organization. But when the Legislature refused to issue an abortion-rights plate, the 'b'American Civil Liberties Union'b' 'b'sued'b'.'b'So, oddly, liberal supporters of abortion rights are allied, on this issue, with the conservative descendants of Confederate veterans. Both argue that license plates are private, not state, messages and are therefore protected.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t agree. We think that Texas was right to reject the Confederate plates, but that North Carolina should have issued the abortion rights plates.'b'How can this be? Are we merely siding with liberals in both cases? No.'b'Under constitutional doctrine, when private individuals express themselves, the government cannot discriminate based on their opinions. But when government is speaking (as in messages on public monuments, for example) it can and in fact must pick and choose. License plates are an important form of \xe2\x80\x9cmixed speech,\xe2\x80\x9d blending both government and private messages. The court must balance the private right to free speech with the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in conveying its own messages. A license plate is not a bumper sticker. Only a private person can decide to display a specialty plate \xe2\x80\x94 but only the state can make it available.'b'Texas rightly sought to avoid the perception that the state was speaking in a way that is contrary to constitutional values like equal protection under the law. It wanted to avoid even the risk of seeming complicit in official nostalgia for the institution of slavery.'b'Imagine a person driving behind a car with a Confederate flag on its license plate. Such a person, especially if she were not familiar with the specialty license plate system, could reasonably think that the flag was displayed with the state\xe2\x80\x99s imprimatur.'b'Why is the North Carolina case different? Unlike in the Texas case, there is no strong government interest in denying pro-choice messages. The right to terminate a pregnancy is currently enshrined in law; the government does not have an important interest in preventing citizens from advertising their existing rights.'b'The Supreme Court could therefore side with Texas, but also with the abortion-rights supporters in the North Carolina case. This would require a balancing approach, holding that the state\xe2\x80\x99s comparatively weak interest in denying the pro-choice plate is outweighed by the group\xe2\x80\x99s interest in expression. Nothing in this approach would deny North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s ability to transmit anti-abortion messages in other ways, as it already may do.'b'Free-speech absolutists say the only way to avoid government favoring of pro-life messages is to turn license plates into a forum for public debate. In their view, once one message is allowed, all messages must be, and anything but pure neutrality in license plate messaging amounts to an abridgment of free speech.'b'The Supreme Court should reject this view. So far, it has said that when the state speaks, there are no constitutional restrictions on what it can say, other than the Establishment Clause, which prohibits state religion. But that is too narrow. An implied endorsement of a racist message, as in the Texas case, could run afoul of the Equal Protection Clause. Texas has a strong interest in avoiding such a violation, and its judgment that such a risk is present should be given deference.'b'Whatever the court decides could have broader implications. In a dispute in its last term over legislative prayer, for instance, it 'b'waffled'b' on whether prayers given by private clergy at a town\xe2\x80\x99s invitation amount to government speech. Earlier, in 2010, the court struggled to evaluate Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to transfer a large cross to private ownership, evidently to frustrate a challenge based on the separation of church and state.'b'Denying the Confederate group\xe2\x80\x99s claims would still leave them options. They can use bumper stickers or follow the example of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Dukes of Hazzard\xe2\x80\x9d and paint the flag on their car. But they may not force the state to help them.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Home Schooling: More Pupils, Less Regulation'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 5):'b'The push for looser requirements and less accountability for parents who home-school their children may obscure gaps in home-schooled children\xe2\x80\x99s education.'b'In general, while children who are home-schooled do well on verbal tests, they do not perform as well in mathematics and have been found to have slightly lower scores on the mathematics SAT and ACT exams.

Children who are home-schooled risk being socially isolated.'b'Parents who home-school may be \xe2\x80\x9cdedicated and self-motivated\xe2\x80\x9d teachers, as one person you quote says, but the quality of the instruction delivered has been shown to be correlated with parents\xe2\x80\x99 educational background, not their motivation. Parents who home-school their children may not have the knowledge of specialized subjects and pedagogical techniques equal to that of trained teachers.'b'Home schooling may be the best option for some children.

Passions run high when it comes to trade deals these days, and the Obama administration is working hard to sell it to labor unions, which roundly oppose it.'b'So far the pitch has been about what the deal, as written, will do to help the American economy \xe2\x80\x94 a pitch that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t won over many, on either side of the partisan divide. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing the administration can do that will both win over some opponents and address one of the biggest issues in global trade: add a chapter on currency manipulation.'b'It is not unusual for countries to manage their exchange rate \xe2\x80\x94 the value of their currency relative to others \xe2\x80\x94 to make their exports cheap while making others\xe2\x80\x99 exports to them more expensive. This method has been used extensively by, among others, China, Japan, Malaysia and Singapore \xe2\x80\x94 aside from China, all signatories to the partnership.'b'The American dollar is a prime target for these currency managers. First, the dollar is the global trading system\xe2\x80\x99s premier reserve currency, meaning dollars are freely traded and confidently accepted by international investors. And Americans are a highly acquisitive people \xe2\x80\x94 a nice way of saying we buy a lot of stuff. Consumer spending as a share of gross domestic product is about 70 percent here, 55 percent in Europe and 35 percent in China. We\xe2\x80\x99re steady customers for export-led economies.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with that, until these exporters start buying dollars to raise the value of the dollar relative to their own currencies, thus subsidizing their exports and taxing their imports. In the United States, the result is persistent trade deficits that have been a drag on growth and jobs \xe2\x80\x94 better-than-average manufacturing jobs \xe2\x80\x94 for decades.'b'In a compelling argument for including a chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership to restrict currency manipulation, C. Fred Bergsten of the Peterson Institute for International Economics 'b'estimated'b' that America\xe2\x80\x99s trade deficit \xe2\x80\x9chas averaged $200 billion to $500 billion per year higher as a result of the manipulation\xe2\x80\x9d by the rest of the world, resulting in the loss of one million to five million jobs.'b'The challenge is in the details. Countries buy foreign currencies for various reasons, not just to gain a trade advantage, and they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily be held to account for doing so. Moreover, opponents of such a chapter argue that it would cover the actions of our own central bank, the Federal Reserve, and open it to charges that it also manipulates exchange rates. (When the Fed lowers the short-term interest rate, or engages in \xe2\x80\x9cquantitative easing\xe2\x80\x9d to lower longer-term rates, one clear consequence is to lower the value of the dollar.)'b'But that argument doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite hold. It\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of intent, and there is a clear test: whether the central bank is engaging in domestic demand management or currency management, and the simplest way to tell is to observe whether the bank is buying foreign currencies. The People\xe2\x80\x99s Bank of China does a great deal of that. Our Fed does almost none.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that deals like the Trans-Pacific Partnership are not necessarily about \xe2\x80\x9cfree trade.\xe2\x80\x9d They are instead a set of rules; some, like lowering tariffs, lead to freer trade, while others, like expanding patent protections, are more protectionist. Rules governing currency tactics certainly fit the framework.'b'Some purchasing of foreign currency should be fine under the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Some developing economies collect dollars to cover their external debts in case of financial crises and large outflows of private capital. With this in mind, Mr. Bergsten suggests that holding enough foreign currency to cover a year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of external liabilities might be a sound benchmark; anything more would be questionable.'b'Once we\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed on what currency management looks like, what actions would a chapter on it take? These could include a tax on the imports of offending countries, fines, the temporary canceling of certain trade privileges and my favorite, 'b'reciprocal currency intervention'b': If countries can go into currency markets and buy dollars, then we must be able to do the same with their currency. That\xe2\x80\x99s not currently possible with China and other countries, which use capital controls to block such large purchases.'b'Speaking of China, even though it\xe2\x80\x99s not part of the partnership talks, rules like these, especially reciprocity, should be applied to it as well. Not to do so would put the signatory countries at a distinct disadvantage to a trade behemoth with a history of undervaluing its currency to maintain trade surpluses.'b'As a White House economist in the first few years of the Obama administration, I learned that many of my colleagues shared my concerns about currency management. But all administrations believe the only way to do something about it is through quiet diplomacy. They believe that writing down rules in a trade agreement is too risky, with the potential to scuttle the whole deal.'b'Diplomacy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked. A more direct approach is needed. If the trade deal\xe2\x80\x99s supporters want an agreement worthy of broad support, this is a chance they can\xe2\x80\x99t afford to miss.'b'The video of Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey clumsily trying to high-five Dallas Cowboys executives went viral days ago. But apart from causing a good deal of merriment, the 'b'awkward embrace'b' between Mr. Christie and the Cowboys\xe2\x80\x99 owner, Jerry Jones, after the team\xe2\x80\x99s comeback win Sunday over the Detroit Lions, has drawn attention to a potentially more troubling connection between two powerful friends.'b'Mr. Jones and the Cowboys are part owners of Legends Hospitality, which won a lucrative contract in early 2013 to operate the observation deck at 1 World Trade Center. The contract was awarded by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which Mr. Christie controls along with Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York. Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s game tickets and airfare were paid for by Mr. Jones.'b'This is already rocky territory for Mr. Christie. There was the intense scrutiny over the famous traffic jam at the George Washington Bridge in 2013. More recently, suspicions have been raised that his and Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s surprise vetoes of legislation to reform the authority were designed to perpetuate their influence over its operations.'b'Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s aides have denied any connection between the governor\xe2\x80\x99s friendship with Mr. Jones and the Port Authority contract, which the authority said was awarded after a \xe2\x80\x9chighly competitive procurement process.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s staff also insists that the two became friends in the summer of 2013, after the Legends Hospitality deal. The governor himself boasts of a longer relationship. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve become friends with Jerry over the last five years,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said'b'.'b'Mr. Christie says he has been a Cowboys fan since he was 9. (Take that, Jets and Giants.) As for the tickets and airfare, Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s staff says that Executive Order 77 \xe2\x80\x94 the code of conduct for the governor crafted over a decade ago \xe2\x80\x94 allows Mr. Christie to \xe2\x80\x9caccept gifts, favors, services, gratuities, meals, lodging or travel expenses from relatives or personal friends that are paid for with personal funds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That may be the letter of the law. And while it may technically provide cover, it cannot be used to condone thousands of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of hospitality from a powerful magnate with an interest in the Port Authority\xe2\x80\x99s decisions. Mr. Christie can make amends by requiring disclosure of and limits on gifts for governors. The video is embarrassing, but a lack of awareness about public ethics is worse.'b'As we move into a big football weekend, one exciting question uniting fans and nonfans alike is: What will Chris Christie do if Dallas wins?'b'As the world now knows, the governor of New Jersey was so thrilled by the Cowboys\xe2\x80\x99 victory over the Detroit Lions last weekend that he flung himself into the arms of owner Jerry Jones. Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it, it\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to forget 'b'the video of Christie'b', in a rather terrifying orange sweater, trying to insert himself into an embrace between Jones and his son.'b'If Christie is still a serious presidential candidate, it was a very peculiar performance. In fact, it made sense career-wise only if he was campaigning for a future job as a team mascot. Look at the picture, and it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine him giving a State of the Union address, but you can really see him dressed up like a bumblebee or a duck, bouncing around the sidelines and firing a T-shirt cannon into the stands.'b'The biggest cry of outrage came from people who feel that the governor of a state that is home of two professional football teams, the Giants and Jets, as well as multitudinous fans of another nearby team, the Philadelphia Eagles, should be a little more discreet about his hysterical enthusiasm for a mortal enemy from far away. \xe2\x80\x9cPathetic,\xe2\x80\x9d said former Gov. Ed Rendell of Pennsylvania.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou just tell Ed that I remember Ed Rendell when he used to be somebody,\xe2\x80\x9d Christie retorted.'b'Well, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the tough-talking, self-assured Chris Christie that all of us have come to know and, um, know. His supporters argue that The Hug is just regular-guy behavior, from a man who follows Bruce Springsteen like a puppy.'b'Maybe you could give him a pass, if it was not for the fact that this incident involves a football team owner.'b'Owners are terrible! They demand fan loyalty, not to mention fan tax dollars to build their stadiums. Then they readily move their teams somewhere else whenever they see a bigger buck to be made. For mysterious reasons \xe2\x80\x94 I believe it has to do with a desire to avoid buying new stationery \xe2\x80\x94 they cart the old name to the new locale, turning teams like the New Orleans Jazz into the Utah Jazz, a creature whose every mention shrieks: not a group that has anything to do with the place where it is currently located.'b'The Dallas Cowboys are actually no longer in Dallas County, having moved to Arlington, Tex., in 2009. Arlington residents now pay an extra half-cent in sales taxes to help finance the team\xe2\x80\x99s current $1.2 billion stadium, which was also paid for in part by federal tax-free bonds. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s new property-tax-exempt digs are not called Arlington Stadium but AT&amp;T Stadium, for which he gets more than $17 million a year in naming rights.'b'All this helped make the team, which Jones bought in 1989 for $150 million, currently worth about $3.2 billion.'b'Christie flew to the Lions game on Jones\xe2\x80\x99s dime, a freebie that Jones argued the governor deserved. \xe2\x80\x9cHe and his wife used to, on a vacation, use their money to come all the way to Texas to come to a Cowboy game,\xe2\x80\x9d the owner told ESPN, adding that the couple were so poor \xe2\x80\x9cthat they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even buy parking. They had to park far enough away to walk without paying.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We will pause to give readers the time to contemplate the pathetic impoverishment of a couple who have to walk to the football stadium from free parking. Then we will move on to the fact that the Dallas Cowboys are part owner of a company that recently won a $875 million contract from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, an organization that is run mainly by Chris Christie and Andrew Cuomo. The Port Authority is a total patronage machine. A bill to clean it up, which was recently passed in the New York and New Jersey legislatures, was vetoed by Chris Christie and Andrew Cuomo.'b'Christie\xe2\x80\x99s office says the governor counts Jones as a \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal friend,\xe2\x80\x9d and, in New Jersey, personal friends are allowed to give the governor presents. In a better world, this category would be limited to people who have been at your house for a meal at least twice.'b'Christie says he\xe2\x80\x99ll be in Jones\xe2\x80\x99s box on Sunday when the Cowboys play the Green Bay Packers, which is \xe2\x80\x94 oh irony of ironies \xe2\x80\x94 the only team in football that is actually owned by the community in which it plays.'b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a win-win event. Heads, the Packers make more money for the local charities the team supports. Tails, we get to see what Chris Christie does if Dallas wins. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll weep. Invite Jones to tango. He might be a regular guy, but he\xe2\x80\x99s definitely a faux populist.'b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much to stir controversy over America\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with Pakistan. The latest dust-up involves 'b'$532 million'b' in economic assistance that the United States expects to provide later this year. Last week, Pakistani officials jumped the gun by suggesting the money is closer to being disbursed than it is; the news annoyed India, which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think the aid is merited.'b'That is a familiar complaint. Since 9/11, the United States has provided Pakistan with billions of dollars, mostly in military aid, to help fight extremists. There are many reasons to have doubts about the investment. Still, it is in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest to maintain assistance \xe2\x80\x94 at a declining level \xe2\x80\x94 at least for the time being. But much depends on what the money will be used for. One condition for new aid should be that Pakistan do more for itself \xe2\x80\x94 by cutting back on spending for nuclear weapons and requiring its elites to pay taxes.'b'Doubts about the aid center on Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s army, which has long played a double game, accepting America\xe2\x80\x99s money while enabling some militant groups, including members of the Afghan Taliban who have been battling American and Afghan troops in Afghanistan. The relationship hit bottom in 2011 when Osama bin Laden was found hiding in Pakistan and was killed by a Navy SEAL team. But it has since improved. Secretary of State John Kerry is expected to visit Islamabad soon.'b'After militants massacred 148 students and teachers at an army-run school in Peshawar last month, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s government 'b'promised'b' that it would no longer distinguish between \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d militant groups, which are seeking to bring down the Pakistani state, and \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d militant groups that have been supported and exploited by the army to attack India and wield influence in Afghanistan. But there is little evidence that the army has gone after the \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d groups in a serious way.'b'This double game is a big reason that the administration has been unable to fulfill Congress\xe2\x80\x99s mandate to certify that Pakistan has met certain requirements, including preventing its territory from being used for terror attacks, as a condition of assistance. Instead, officials have had to rely on a national security waiver to keep aid flowing.'b'There is a case for doing that. After much foot-dragging, the Pakistani army is finally battling militants in the North Waziristan region, and American officials say there has been real progress.'b'Also, Pakistan has allowed American drone attacks against militants along the border to resume, and is cooperating with the new Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani. Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s help is essential as Mr. Ghani pursues peace talks with the Taliban. It also counts as progress that Pakistan completed a 'b'transition'b' from one civilian government to another in 2013 and that the current government, while fragile, remains in place.'b'American officials say aid has allowed them to maintain some modest leverage with Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s leaders and to invest in projects that advance both countries\xe2\x80\x99 interests, including energy, more than 600 miles of new roads and support for democratic governance. But it makes no sense to subsidize Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s policy failures, which include an obsession with nuclear weapons, paltry investments in education and a refusal to seriously combat extremism.'b'Pakistan still receives more assistance than most countries, a holdover from the days when Washington mistakenly thought it might be a real partner. But the levels are declining and should continue to do so. Cutting aid precipitously would be unwise, but a managed decrease is in line with more realistic expectations about the diminished potential for bilateral cooperation.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s schools are the most segregated in the nation, and the state needs remedies right away. That was the 'b'message delivered'b' to the governor and the Legislature last week by the chancellor of the State Board of Regents. Minority children are disproportionately 'b'trapped in schools'b' that lack the teaching talent, course offerings and resources needed to prepare them for college and success in the new economy.'b'This is not an easy problem to solve. But the state cannot just throw up its hands. It has a moral obligation to ensure that as many children as possible escape failing schools for ones that give them a fighting chance. And history has shown that districts can dramatically improve educational opportunities for minority children \xe2\x80\x94 and reduce racial isolation \xe2\x80\x94 with voluntary transfer plans and especially with high-quality magnet schools that attract middle-class families.'b'This problem is especially urgent in New York\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest city, Buffalo, where federal civil rights officials are enforcing an agreement intended to expand minority access to the better schools in a dysfunctional system, which has suffered from years of abysmal leadership and middle-class flight. Today nearly half the city\xe2\x80\x99s public schools either have low graduation rates or rank in the bottom 5 percent of state schools in math and English.'b'The United States Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Civil Rights began its investigation of charges that the district was discriminating against nonwhite students in admissions to the better schools \xe2\x80\x94 those that choose students based on test scores and other screening.'b'As part of a sweeping resolution agreement with the federal government, the district hired a consultant who is studying the system with the aim of addressing \xe2\x80\x9cthe root causes\xe2\x80\x9d of racial disparities in enrollment and admission rates at the special admission schools \xe2\x80\x94 known in Buffalo as \xe2\x80\x9ccriteria schools.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among other things, this means going back to earlier grades to determine why children might not be getting the guidance, courses and information they need to gain access or admission to the criteria schools. The district did re-evaluate the applications of the children whose families filed the complaint and admitted those who were eligible, providing help and support where necessary.'b'One obvious step would be for Buffalo to expand seats in its eight criteria schools so that more children can benefit. But the federal civil rights agreement does not address the school system as a whole, which is still shortchanging minority children.'b'The irony of the Buffalo situation is that during the 1970s the city made great progress in addressing racial isolation in its schools. A court-ordered desegregation plan pushed Buffalo to create a much sought after system of magnet schools that improved prospects for poor children and attracted large numbers of middle-class families.'b'As The Times 'b'reported in 1985'b', the city was viewed as a national model for racial integration; educators who wished to learn the lessons of Buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s success flocked to the city from around the globe. Things went downhill in the 1990s, however, when court supervision ended and Buffalo experienced severe fiscal problems.'b'The magnet schools that had been so popular were scaled back, alienating middle-class families once again. The decision to dismantle the model system, in other words, was a disastrous mistake. More recently, the Buffalo school system has been hobbled by a wasteful, outmoded teachers\xe2\x80\x99 contract that provides unusually generous benefits and makes it difficult to manage the teaching force. The district has also suffered from inept leadership that has not met basic obligations. It has failed, for example, to file acceptable, legally required plans with the state for turning around low-performing schools. This week, The Buffalo News raised troubling questions about the accounting for funds earmarked for rebuilding the city\xe2\x80\x99s crumbling schools.'b'The Cuomo administration alluded to the chronic problems in the Buffalo schools last month when it asked the Board of Regents what should be done about their \xe2\x80\x9cdeplorable conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d Support appears to be growing for laws giving the state more authority to force policy changes on failing districts and to even appoint receivers to run day-to-day operations, which may be necessary in Buffalo.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re doing God\xe2\x80\x99s work,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Ackman, the hedge fund manager, on CNBC this week. He was referring to his $1 billion bet against Herbalife, the company that he accuses of being an illegal pyramid scheme.'b'For the two years that Ackman has been \xe2\x80\x9cshort\xe2\x80\x9d Herbalife, it has been the most entertaining of business stories. Carl Icahn and Daniel Loeb \xe2\x80\x94 both, like Ackman, activist investors \xe2\x80\x94 made a 'b'grand show'b' of buying Herbalife stock. The stock went up, meaning Icahn and Loeb were making money while Ackman was losing it. Icahn called Ackman a \xe2\x80\x9ccrybaby in the schoolyard.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the two men kissed and made up at a CNBC conference.'b'Ackman made lengthy presentations laying out his evidence that Herbalife was a pyramid scheme. He set up a 'b'website'b' dedicated to exposing it. He raised enough of a stink that both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice opened investigations. Herbalife fought back with its own battery of P.R. people and lobbyists. The company adamantly denies being a pyramid scheme. Since the middle of last year, however, it has failed to meet Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s expectations. Now Herbalife\xe2\x80\x99s stock is way down. Although Ackman is now making money on his Herbalife bet, he is not satisfied. He expects the stock to go to zero.'b'In a way, the ongoing Ackman-Herbalife story is a little like the coverage of a hotly contested political campaign. The horse-race aspect is so entertaining that sometimes more serious issues get short shrift. In this case, the issue is not whether Ackman is up or down or feuding with Icahn, but whether Herbalife \xe2\x80\x94 like dozens of other \xe2\x80\x9c'b'multilevel marketing'b'\xe2\x80\x9d companies \xe2\x80\x94 is, in fact, a pyramid scheme.'b'Pyramid schemes are terrible things \xe2\x80\x94 in some ways worse than Ponzi schemes. For one thing, they often involve more money \xe2\x80\x94 the direct-selling industry, which includes multilevel marketing, claims that it generates $154 billion in annual revenue and has some 90 million members worldwide. For another, most pyramid schemes take advantage of lower-income people, who are lured in by the prospect of making money while working from home, only to discover that, as pyramid scheme experts will tell you, 99 percent of the people who participate wind up losing money, and sometimes a lot of money.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are millions of victims,\xe2\x80\x9d says a pyramid scheme expert named Bruce Craig. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why people aren\xe2\x80\x99t interested in this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Craig is a former Wisconsin assistant attorney general, now retired, who brought a number of pyramid scheme lawsuits in his day. He is passionate about the issue. What frustrates him even more than the lack of attention is the way the government has, in his view, largely rolled over for the industry.'b'A pyramid scheme, fundamentally, is a scheme in which the only way to make money is to recruit other people, who recruit other people, and so on. It is a kind of chain letter with a product attached to give it the sheen of legitimacy. Until 1979, the Federal Trade Commission was pretty tough on pyramid schemes, according to Craig. But that year, an administrative judge for the F.T.C. ruled that Amway was not a pyramid scheme because it had certain protections for its members, such as not requiring a large entry fee and buying back excessive inventory. Since then, with a little finesse, pyramid schemes could turn themselves into multilevel marketing companies.'b'Craig has written letters to F.T.C. commissioners asking them to review the Amway decision \xe2\x80\x9con the question of enforcement and enforceability of its rules,\xe2\x80\x9d an issue he believes allows companies like Amway \xe2\x80\x94 and Herbalife \xe2\x80\x94 to pretend to be real when in fact they are pyramid schemes. In one of those letters, he quoted from a 2010 'b'F.T.C. staff report'b' that said that identifying pyramid schemes \xe2\x80\x9centails a complex economic analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d The report added that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no bright line disclosure that would help consumers identify a fraudulent pyramid from a legitimate [multilevel marketing company].\xe2\x80\x9d Really?'b'When I spoke to John DeSimone, the chief financial officer of Herbalife, he insisted that the company was legit. He said it was built on sales of its weight and nutrition products rather than recruitment. He said it offered numerous protections, such as a money-back guarantee for the first year. He said 80 percent of its members never recruit another person. Ackman, for his part, says that 'b'none of this is true'b', and that the F.T.C. will ultimately see that Herbalife is the very definition of a pyramid scheme.'b'Assuming, of course, that the F.T.C. has a definition. On Friday afternoon, I called the agency and asked what distinguished an illegal pyramid scheme from a legal direct-selling company. Even having talked to Craig, I found it hard to believe that it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have some kind of definition.'b'A few hours later, I received an email from an F.T.C. public relations staffer. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d it began, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to offer you any on (or off) record assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'IS email overload bad for you?'b'This is a complicated question. Although researchers have found a correlation between dealing with email and adverse well-being (for example, feeling stressed or emotionally drained), this does not mean that email itself is necessarily the culprit. (Perhaps a busier work schedule is what causes stress \xe2\x80\x94 and spending lots of time on email is a mere artifact of a busier work schedule.) Furthermore, such research suggests that, even if email is the culprit, the sheer volume of email that people handle might not be the problem.'b'This points to another possibility: Could the 'b'frequency'b' with which you check your email play a role in causing stress? After all, three-quarters of workers report replying to email within an hour or less of receiving it, according to a 'b'recent survey'b' of 503 employees at workplaces in the United States.'b'This question motivated us to design an exploratory two-week 'b'field experiment'b', the results of which will appear in next month\xe2\x80\x99s issue of the journal Computers in Human Behavior.'b'We recruited a sample of 124 adults, ranging from students and professors to physicians and I.T. workers. In the first week of the study, we told half our participants \xe2\x80\x94 chosen at random \xe2\x80\x94 to check their email as often as they could each day, while keeping their mailboxes open and email alerts on. Meanwhile, we asked the other participants to check email only three times a day, while keeping their mailboxes closed and alerts off.'b'During the second week, we flipped the instructions, so the email-maximizers became the email-minimizers, and vice versa. This design allowed us to compare how stressed the same individuals felt when they checked their email more versus less often, while keeping everything else constant.'b'At the end of each weekday, the participants reported how the day had gone on a wide range of measures. To assess stress, we asked them, for example, how often they felt unable to control the important things in their life and how often they had trouble coping with all the things they had to do that day.'b'Although the only thing we changed about the participants\xe2\x80\x99 lives was how often they checked their email, we observed a significant reduction in stress when they checked email less frequently. How much less stressed did people feel during their email-minimizing week compared with their email-maximizing week? The reduction in stress was about as large as 'b'the benefit'b' people get from learning relaxation techniques (e.g., taking deep breaths, visualizing peaceful imagery). In other words, cutting back on email might reduce stress as much as picturing yourself swimming in the warm waters of a tropical island several times a day.'b'Checking email less often may reduce stress in part by cutting down on the need to switch between tasks. An unfortunate limitation of the human mind is that it cannot perform two demanding tasks simultaneously, so flipping back and forth between two different tasks 'b'saps cognitive resources'b'. As a result, people can become 'b'less efficient'b' in each of the tasks they need to accomplish. In addition to providing an unending source of new tasks for our to-do lists, email could also be making us less efficient at accomplishing those tasks.'b'Indeed, although the participants in our study sent and received roughly the same number of emails during both weeks, they reported doing so in approximately 20 percent less time during the week when they checked their email less frequently. Constantly monitoring our inboxes promotes stress without promoting efficiency. When it comes to checking email, less might be more.'b'But habits are difficult to break. Even when we asked participants to check email only three times a day, they typically admitted to logging in almost five times a day. And while writing this article about the value of cutting back on email, we found our own eyes drawn toward our inboxes.'b'For some individuals, though, checking email less frequently is simply not an option. The stockbroker who misses a million-dollar deal by logging off email is likely to feel more, not less, stressed. That said, most of us probably check our email more often than is truly necessary to get our job done. A 'b'recent survey'b' found that 55 percent of workers reported checking their email after 11 p.m. \xe2\x80\x94 and 6 percent reported checking email while they or their spouse were in labor. (One of the authors of this article admits to falling into this 6 percent.)'b'Far from offering a magic number that works for all, our findings simply suggest that making the effort to close the gap between necessity and compulsion is worthwhile. So if you\xe2\x80\x99re still hunting for a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution, try to resist visiting your inbox as often as you feel compelled to do.'b'NEVER before have so many people been on the move. New opportunity, like a bright star, draws immigrants across the world. In every one of the past four generations my family has moved, hopping from Lithuania to what is now South Africa and on to Britain, Israel and the United States. Sometimes they have found success and happiness. But the other side of displacement, its black sun, is loss.'b'The strain of burying the past, losing one identity and embracing another, can be overwhelming. Home is an indelible place. It is the landscape of unfiltered experience, of things felt rather than thought through, of the world in its beauty absorbed before it is understood, of patterns and sounds that lodge themselves in the psyche and call out across the years. When home is left behind, or shattered, an immense struggle often ensues to fill the void.'b'I was born in London to South African Jewish parents. We left almost immediately for South Africa, lived there for two years and returned to Britain. Although the word was never uttered, we were immigrants. Our priority was assimilation into Englishness. Pogroms and penury had been left far behind. The past was as silent as a village at the bottom of a dam.'b'Why then was I tugged to Israel as a college student? Our Jewish identity had been dribbling away ever since my great-grandparents and grandparents left Lithuania for South Africa around the turn of the 20th century. It was a slow process but appeared inexorable.'b'Having been persecuted as Jews in the Eastern European shtetl, my forebears put their faith in education and science to usher them from backwardness. My father did have a bar mitzvah in Johannesburg in 1934 but hated the experience, seeing it as an exercise in obscurantism and hypocrisy. He reached England in the mid-1950s with no inclination to inflict such instruction on me.'b'His was the silence, or at least discretion, shared by many Jews \xe2\x80\x94 whether Holocaust survivors or not \xe2\x80\x94 in the postwar years, especially in Europe. There was after Auschwitz something shameful about survival that no Jew could abjure. Why them and not me? Better, at least in England, to look forward, work hard, say little, and confine protest to shunning German cars.'b'Tradition and custom and ceremony went missing. No days were different from any other days. We did not have a Christmas tree. Nor did we have anything else. Our deity was academic and professional achievement. My father\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a scientist in his adopted country was meteoric.'b'Nonetheless in time I wanted what I was not given, a Jewish identity, because that, simply, is what I felt myself to be, a Jew. Being called a \xe2\x80\x9cYid\xe2\x80\x9d during my first year in high school stirred within me a lost and then defiant identity. In England, Philip Roth wrote, people\xe2\x80\x99s voices always drop \xe2\x80\x9cjust a little\xe2\x80\x9d when Jews are mentioned \xe2\x80\x94 and indeed my mother\xe2\x80\x99s voice used to drop when she said the word in the land of Lewis Namier\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctrembling Israelites.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Adaptation to England, with its retreat-from-empire gloom, proved too much for my mother, June. Born on Human Street in the small South African mining town of Krugersdorp in 1929, she was bright and full of laughter, with lovely, pale skin and thick, bouncy curls. She was highly strung, with a rapier wit. In 1950, upon graduation from Johannesburg\xe2\x80\x99s University of the Witwatersrand, she married Sydney, a young doctor born on Honey Street in the Berea district of the city. A few years later the girl from Human Street and the boy from Honey Street decided to turn their backs on the horrors of apartheid. They emigrated.'b'June\xe2\x80\x99s first depression occurred soon after. It came on after she was uprooted, bounced back and forth between England and South Africa, set down at last in north London in 1957, pregnant with my younger sister, Jenny. She had a hardworking husband and was obliged to get on with life as best she could as she raised two infants without all the support she had known in South Africa. She placed coins in a meter for hot water. She strained to fit in, to drop South Africa and its tight-knit Jewish community, to belong again. She wanted to help my father, her overriding goal always. Instead, she collapsed.'b'She was admitted in 1958 to a sanitarium near London. Diagnosed with \xe2\x80\x9cpost-puerperal depression,\xe2\x80\x9d she first underwent electroshock treatment on July 30, 1958, and again on Aug. 1, 1958, the day before my third birthday, as it took me more than a half century to discover. Later she suffered from manic depression and never shook it off. In each generation of my family the condition recurred \xe2\x80\x94 a great-uncle in Johannesburg, a cousin who committed suicide in Tel Aviv at age 28. The question is whether my mother\xe2\x80\x99s condition was endogenous, a purely pharmacological issue, or exogenous, a psychological issue tied to our Jewish odyssey of the 20th century and the tremendous pressure of wandering, adapting, pretending, silencing and forgetting.'b'There can be no absolute answer. The study of epigenetics is a relatively new one that seeks to explore how something in the external environment can, in the words of Rachel Yehuda, an Israeli-born neuroscientist and psychiatrist, \xe2\x80\x9caffect the internal environment, and before you know it a gene is functioning in a different way.\xe2\x80\x9d Evidence is growing of such trauma-induced changes. Yehuda quoted Ezekiel in a recent interview with Tablet: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fathers ate sour grapes, and the children\xe2\x80\x99s teeth were set on edge.\xe2\x80\x9d My mother was always on edge. After the electroshock treatment she was like a tree hollowed out by lightning. As her life progressed, she craved return to the sun and South Africa.'b'This was not supposed to happen. As immigrants, our gaze was to be forward-looking. June, despite her suffering, made an immense effort to that end. But the shock of upheaval can prove too much for some people. The project of starting anew collapses; its foundations are too weak.'b'European societies make fitting in harder than America. The difference between those who came first and those who came last in the United States is negligible beside the intricate matter of British ancestry \xe2\x80\x94 not to mention the subtle matter of British anti-Semitism. June had been raised in a cocoon of new South African wealth so enveloping as to eliminate, almost overnight, the Lithuanian past. I was raised an English boy, as if England were my birthright.'b'A child of repetitive Jewish displacement, I would sit in a Christian epicenter of continuity, Westminster Abbey, every school-day morning. This irony was lost on me. I was unaware that my paternal grandparents and much of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s family came from the shtetls of northern Lithuania; or that my upbringing, while bestowing the gifts of a superb liberal education, had also been devoted to the expunging of this past, as well as to the suppression of the not-unrelated history of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s mental breakdown.'b'I see my forebears losing touch with one another and fanning out across the world. I see the ebb and flow of their fortunes and the battle for assimilation. Theirs is a constant, almost manic, reinvention \xe2\x80\x94 in Johannesburg, in London, in Jerusalem, in Cleveland. Yet all the while they carry within them a bipolar gene that forms an unbroken chain with the past, liable to surface at any moment. They fight for that feeling of belonging that goes with home, the elusive place where, as Robert Frost noted, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have to go there, they have to take you in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'My mother\xe2\x80\x99s suicide note to my father of July 25, 1978, was found in the Hampstead house on the hill she loved; the house she had, in a bout of manic activity, agreed to sell the previous March to buy a Georgian terraced jewel on Lord North Street in central London, only to cancel the sale when she plunged back into a depression in June.'b'She had suffered from a combination of symptoms: weight loss, dizzy spells, hot flashes, as well as alternating hyperactivity and inertia, or manic depression. In early February, a doctor had again suggested electroshock treatment. No! Two decades on from her 1958 confinement, she would not return to that hell. She would not tolerate again the metal plates being strapped to her swabbed temples, enclosing her skull in its high-voltage carapace.'b'The strain of hiding her condition was enormous. She had to pursue her work as a magistrate and maintain the outward appearance of familial stability. Voiding the real estate deal concluded in manic March filled June with guilt over the time and money wasted. One thing about mania, with its rashness and rages, is that it provides plenty of legitimate reasons for remorse during the ensuing depressive phase.'b'My father came home from work and found the bedroom doors closed. He thought little of it. June was often in bed. He fixed himself a whiskey, sat down with the papers. It was a mild summer\xe2\x80\x99s evening, sunlight glinting through the trees, clouds of gnats against the fence. June\xe2\x80\x99s cycles were running at three-month intervals. With luck, come September she would be active again. Sydney tossed the papers aside. He tried the bedroom door. It was locked. He raced around to the other door, from the bathroom.'b'It was locked. He ran outside. The net curtains were drawn. The windows looked sealed. On closer inspection, one was very slightly ajar.'b'My mother lay sprawled on the bed, a bottle of gin beside her. She had taken large doses of doxepin and Valium, washed down with the gin. Her arms were thrown back behind her head.'b'Her pupils were scarcely responsive, her breathing shallow. The suicide note written to my father was beside her bed: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are made to do great things, make immensely useful discoveries to aid all mankind and I\xe2\x80\x99m leaving you to continue unimpeded by my burden. I so much hoped to help you and to help you and to love and adore you ...\xe2\x80\x9d June survived, just. The emetic effect of the gin probably saved her. She vowed to us all that she would never again \xe2\x80\x9cresort to such a drastic step.\xe2\x80\x9d But death was always the cajoling voice in her ear.'b'June tried to kill herself again on June 15, 1982. Again there was a suicide note. Again, she survived, barely. At last cancer took her on Jan. 2, 1999, at age 69.'b'Mental illness is a charnel house from which nobody escapes unscathed. My parents\xe2\x80\x99 marriage, in its last two decades, was filled with terrible silences and fierce eruptions. After the loss of my mother, I had to find vitality at any price. Every relationship was a mausoleum in the making.'b'When a parent dies unhappy, there is something unresolved that keeps nagging. It is irrational to want to save my mother from her torment \xe2\x80\x94 and now I cannot anyway. Still, because of her, I had to go back. The void, ever renewed, that her absence has left can be explained only by her refusal to stop believing in love, however compromised by frailty her expression of it was. Love and acceptance and stoicism and dignity were, against all odds, her fundamental and enduring lessons. Her spirit, housed too long in that troubled body, had immense strength.'b'IT was my father she had loved most deeply, despite everything. My father, who had begun another relationship to survive, and who had hardened with the demands and the secrecy of that involvement, crumpled with a grief that shocked him after my mother\xe2\x80\x99s death. He wrote to me:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour expanding memories of Mom have become infinitely precious and important; I share with you the vision of a light which is the obverse of her tormenting darkness and which in some miraculous way has become completely dominant since her death. I hope and pray that this vision of her will be an enduring source of strength and inspiration to you in all the years ahead, ever cherished and unsullied.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor myself, I did have a fleeting dream of a few tranquil years carrying me into the sunset. I still hope for that in a mental and bodily sense. But I know that my spirit will not soon be released from those cruel demons that tore so relentlessly at the entwining fabric of love between Mom and me. I did strive within the feeble limits of my human fallibility to preserve and cherish and sustain her. But alas \xe2\x80\x94 for Mama ultimately, death was the only angel that could shield her from despair.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We were too undone to ask for the urn with my mother\xe2\x80\x99s ashes. I do not know where it ended up. The girl from Human Street left no trace of her anguished passage across the earth, from the Southern to the Northern Hemisphere. After her high school records from Barnato Park in Johannesburg, after the bulk of her medical records from the Holloway Sanatorium near London, her very physical remains vanished, too. From an early age, I had grown used to deploying my imagination as a defense. I told many other stories with many foreign datelines before I realized, returning to the place where I began, that the one story I had to tell was hers \xe2\x80\x94 and through hers that of a far-flung Jewish family, tied by the pain of forgetting, the strain of assimilation, the curse of mental illness and the ever-renewed consolation of love.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'WELCOME visitors to New York City!

Instead of receiving thanks for their efforts, cops have been cursed and attacked. Hate-mongering led by President Obama built a climate of animosity that led to the murder of two of New York\xe2\x80\x99s finest. And where are the street protests denouncing those racist murders?

I read it like an evolutionary detective story to find out how we became what we are.'b''b'LISTENING'b' I\xe2\x80\x99ve just digitized all the hundreds of CDs and tapes I own and put them on a sound system called 'b'Sonos'b'. I\xe2\x80\x99ve started listening to stuff I\xe2\x80\x99d forgotten I had. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been comparing various Beethoven sonatas by various performers. And I recently discovered, while listening to music on Singapore Airlines, some classical Indian music performers, including 'b'Pandit Jasraj'b'. There\xe2\x80\x99s something about his voice and intonation and the accompanying voices and instruments that\xe2\x80\x99s almost like an archetype \xe2\x80\x94 like the beginning of music.'b''b'WATCHING'b' 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBethlehem\xe2\x80\x9d'b' is a disturbing film about the recruitment of a very young man by the Israeli secret service. The relationship between the operative and the boy is very complex and multifaceted. 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOmar\xe2\x80\x9d'b' has a similar theme but a more conventional story. It\xe2\x80\x99s about young people being talked into terrorism and sometimes submitting and sometimes resisting.'b''b'FOLLOWING 'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t tweet or do Facebook. I use a computer for email and searches but not for design. I walk around the office giving out pens and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cTry that, you might like it.\xe2\x80\x9d You should conceive and sketch first. Architects get seduced by wild shapes designed on a computer and build these things whether they work or not in the environment. That\xe2\x80\x99s the danger of computers: There\xe2\x80\x99s a facility about them that allows you to do charming, seductive things that have no deeper meaning.'b''b'DRINKING'b' Recently, with my wife, in Venice, we bought colorful glasses designed by 'b'Carlo Moretti'b'. They are slightly elliptical and snuggle in the hand with layers of colored glass in them \xe2\x80\x94 saturated red; a little yellow; clear, deep blues; turquoise. We just picked 10 and they are all different, creating a symphony of color.'b''b'SWIMMING'b' I ran until my knees gave out, and now I swim in a club pool near my home in Cambridge in the winter and at 'b'Walden Pond'b' in the summer and hotel pools when I travel, the longest of which is on the roof of a building I designed, 'b'Marina Bay Sands'b', in Singapore. It\xe2\x80\x99s the size of three Olympic pools in a row.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99VE been called many unpleasant things in my life, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve deserved no small number of them. But I chafe at this latest label:'b'A threat to your religious liberty.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean me alone. I mean me and my evidently menacing kind: men who have romantic relationships with other men and maybe want to marry them, and women in analogous situations. According to many of the Americans who still cast judgment on us, our \xe2\x80\x9cI do\xe2\x80\x9d somehow tramples you, not merely running counter to your creed but running roughshod over it.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s absurd. And the deference that many politicians show to such thinking is an example not of religion getting the protection it must but of religious people getting a pass that isn\xe2\x80\x99t warranted. It\xe2\x80\x99s an illustration of religion\xe2\x80\x99s favored status in a country that\xe2\x80\x99s still working out this separation-of-church-and-state business and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet gotten it quite right.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re at an interesting crossroads, brought about by the rapid advance of same-sex marriage. It\xe2\x80\x99s now legal in 36 states, including, as of last week, Florida. Equality is increasingly being enshrined into law, and one response from those opposed to it is that the law shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to them.'b'Why? Because it contradicts their religious beliefs, which they use as a fig leaf for intolerance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the new wave, the new frame,\xe2\x80\x9d James Esseks, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., told me. He said that last year, more than 10 states considered legislation that, to varying degree, blessed discrimination based on sexual orientation by people claiming that it was a right, a matter of religious liberty. Only one of those states, Mississippi, passed such a law, but efforts elsewhere persist. A Virginia lawmaker introduced this sort of legislation just a few weeks ago.'b'The issue is also playing out in courts. As Michael Paulson noted in a 'b'recent story'b' in The Times, judges have been hearing complaints about a florist or baker or photographer refusing to serve customers having same-sex weddings. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been siding so far with the gay couples.'b'But this is only the beginning, especially with the contest for the Republican presidential nomination gathering steam.'b'Several likely candidates \xe2\x80\x94 Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee \xe2\x80\x94 get a special gleam in their eyes when they\xe2\x80\x99re denigrating gays, and Huckabee has perfected a stew of homophobia and puerility, on display in a new book of his that sounds like a collection of recipes by Paula Deen expressly for the N.R.A.: \xe2\x80\x9cGod, Guns, Grits and Gravy.\xe2\x80\x9d With three copies you get a free sandwich combo at Chick-fil-A.'b'Kidding.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cGod, Guns, Grits and Gravy\xe2\x80\x9d (it bears repeating), he bemoans the acquiescence of air travelers to invasive screenings with this dignified locution: \xe2\x80\x9cBend over and take it like a prisoner.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact that\xe2\x80\x99s the title of a whole chapter, with an exclamation point added. This, mind you, is from someone who once governed a state (Arkansas) and won the 2008 Republican caucus in Iowa.'b'Another probable contender, Jeb Bush, weighed in anew on same-sex marriage last week, and some of his words \xe2\x80\x94 that laws must be honored and same-sex couples respected \xe2\x80\x94 were encouraging. But he also said that America needed to take care to \xe2\x80\x9csafeguard religious liberty,\xe2\x80\x9d and there are several problems with that formulation.'b'For starters, it perpetuates confusion, some of which is cynically engineered, about the consequences of marriage-equality laws. They do 'b'not'b' pertain to religious services or what happens in a church, temple or mosque; no clergy member will be compelled to preside over gay nuptials. Civil weddings are covered. That\xe2\x80\x99s it.'b'But also, \xe2\x80\x9creligious liberty\xe2\x80\x9d sounds disturbingly like a dog whistle to the crowd that wants specified, codified exemption from anti-discrimination laws; it\xe2\x80\x99s one of the phrases they lean on. If Bush didn\xe2\x80\x99t know that, he should have. If he did, he just sided, for the moment, with religious extremists.'b'As these lamentations about religious liberty get tossed around, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth remembering that racists have used the same argument to try to perpetuate segregation. Esseks noted that even after the Civil Rights Act, the owner of the Piggie Park restaurant chain in South Carolina maintained that he could refuse to serve black people because his religion forbade the mixing of races. The courts were unimpressed.'b'Christian fundamentalists in this country are practiced at claiming marginalization and oppression. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re always saying they\xe2\x80\x99re kept out of the public square, and that\xe2\x80\x99s baloney,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marci Hamilton, a constitutional law expert and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cGod vs. the Gavel.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re all over the public square.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They and their churches inject themselves into political debates while enjoying tax-exempt status. They get public support in questionable circumstances. After a student Christian magazine insisted on its right to funds from the University of Virginia, the Supreme Court decided in 1995 that if a nonreligious publication got financial help from a public school, so must a religious publication, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s proselytizing.'b'And churches have been allowed to adopt broad, questionable interpretations of a \xe2\x80\x9cministerial exception\xe2\x80\x9d to anti-discrimination laws that allow them to hire and fire clergy as they wish.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, in a country that\xe2\x80\x99s not supposed to promote any one religion over others, we do precisely that.'b'Would we be content to let a Muslim store owner who believes that a woman should always cover her hair refuse service to women who do not? Or a Mormon hairdresser who spurns coffee to turn away clients who saunter in with frappuccinos?'b'I doubt it. So why should a merchant whose version of Christianity condemns homosexuality get to exile gays and lesbians?'b'Baking a cake, arranging roses, running an inn: These aren\xe2\x80\x99t religious acts, certainly not if the establishments aren\xe2\x80\x99t religious enclaves and are doing business with (and even dependent on) the general public.'b'Their owners are routinely interacting with customers who behave in ways they deem sinful. They don\xe2\x80\x99t get to single out one group of supposed sinners. If they\xe2\x80\x99re allowed to, who\xe2\x80\x99s to say they\xe2\x80\x99ll stop at that group?'b'I respect people of faith. I salute the extraordinary works of compassion and social justice that many of them and many of their churches do. I acknowledge that we in the news media, because we tend to emphasize conflict and wrongdoing and hypocrisy, sometimes focus more on the shortcomings of religious institutions than on their positive contributions.'b'And I support the right of people to believe what they do and say what they wish \xe2\x80\x94 in their pews, homes and hearts.'b'But outside of those places? You must put up with me, just as I put up with you.'b'JOHANNESBURG \xe2\x80\x94 A FEW weeks ago, as I was leaving my office, I stopped at a traffic light and watched a young woman cross the street in front of me. She wore a pair of jean shorts cut fashionably high, and I could see the crease of her left buttock extend each time she took a step. She wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been out of place in London or New York or Tokyo. Except that this was Johannesburg, the biggest city in a country known for its high levels of violence against women. As I pulled away, I worried that she might be assaulted.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not suggesting that she was inviting trouble. I was anxious because she was walking near the spot where a young woman in a miniskirt had been attacked by a crowd of men a few years earlier. I\xe2\x80\x99d also just watched 'b'footage'b' of a crowd attacking and stripping a miniskirt-clad woman in Nairobi just days after the release of the viral video of a woman in New York being catcalled. A few weeks later, another video surfaced in Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Harare. A girl in a short dress was dragged from a minibus onto the street, where an angry crowd of men stripped her naked.'b'Public strippings represent the front lines of a cultural war against women\xe2\x80\x99s advancements in traditionally conservative but rapidly urbanizing societies. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t really about what women are wearing. They are much more about where women are going.'b'And many African women are going places quickly. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala became the first female finance minister in Nigeria; Liberia\xe2\x80\x99s president, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, is one of a handful of elected female heads of state in the world. Lupita Nyong\xe2\x80\x99o\xe2\x80\x99s Oscar win and Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie\xe2\x80\x99s literary successes have brought attention to the artistic triumphs of a younger generation of women.'b'Nowhere has progress been more remarkable than in Africa\xe2\x80\x99s legislatures. Africans have significantly outpaced their female peers in America and Europe. In the United States, women hold less than 20 percent of the seats in Congress; similarly, in Britain, women make up just over one-fifth of the members of the House of Commons. Compare this to South Africa, where more than 'b'40 percent'b' of representatives in the National Assembly are women, or Rwanda, where 64 percent of all members of Parliament are women \xe2\x80\x94 making it the only country in the world where women outnumber men in the legislature.'b'Beginning in the 1980s, many African countries started to invest in girls\xe2\x80\x99 education and in small enterprise projects. A generation later, an equal number of girls and boys are enrolled in primary schools across the continent. Many women are successful entrepreneurs and, of course, politicians. Precisely because of these rapid changes in women\xe2\x80\x99s status, the backlash from churches, political parties, traditional leaders and rural officials has been forceful. Outrage at bold women is both spontaneous and organized. The mob mentality that leads to public strippings arises in urban milieus where male aggression against women is seen as acceptable. Meanwhile, many churches systematically preach female subservience, while traditional tribal leaders often blame women for dislodging men from their rightful places in modern societies.'b'It has taken some time for this conservative backlash to develop into a coherent and organized force, but today these churches, traditional leaders and politicians are forming powerful coalitions that are seeking to challenge decades of progress.'b'First, this loose men\xe2\x80\x99s movement developed a set of \xe2\x80\x9cdecency bills\xe2\x80\x9d urging women not to undermine their African culture by dressing \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriately.\xe2\x80\x9d In Uganda, an anti-pornography bill initially sought to criminalize the display of \xe2\x80\x9csexual parts of a person such as breasts, thighs, buttocks or genitalia\xe2\x80\x9d and to ban behavior that might cause sexual excitement. Overzealous police officers began to arrest women wearing short skirts even before Parliament voted on the measure. Fierce opposition from women\xe2\x80\x99s groups forced changes to the final bill signed last year by President Yoweri Museveni, but it remains a vague and problematic law that gives broad discretion to state officials to define pornography and arrest those suspected of an ill-defined crime.'b'Second, and more pernicious, the movement against women\xe2\x80\x99s rights has resorted to bullying and baiting successful women in public spaces. In South Africa, one of the most popular and trusted figures in the country is Thuli Madonsela, who holds the office of public protector. Political cartoonists often depict her as a caped superhero on a mission to bust corrupt politicians. She is widely respected for her refusal to back down in the face of political pressure related to her investigation of the government\xe2\x80\x99s spending on a palatial personal residence for President Jacob G. Zuma.'b'Despite her popularity, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been an easy ride for Ms. Madonsela and other women who occupy prominent public positions. They have often been subjected to sexist verbal abuse and taunts and jeers about how they look and dress. Members of the ruling party have had to be called to order after insulting Ms. Madonsela\xe2\x80\x99s appearance. Last year, a pregnant member of Parliament was mocked so viciously about the outfit she was wearing that she had to be hospitalized for stress.'b'THESE verbal assaults in the halls of power are mirrored by the experiences of women on the streets, who don\xe2\x80\x99t have easy access to the constitutional or party protections that public figures enjoy. Ordinary African women, it seems, are bearing the brunt of their sisters\xe2\x80\x99 progress. Street harassment is often a sign of deep-seated resentment of women\xe2\x80\x99s changing status in society. For men who were raised to believe that they are entitled to be breadwinners and receive sexual gratification and domestic subservience from women, the shift hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been easy. For younger men, modern values have jostled sharply against the lessons about manhood they learned at home. With high levels of unemployment and gaping inequalities, old conceptions of masculinity die hard.'b'South Africa has what is considered the most progressive constitution in the world, including a bill of rights that promotes and protects women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. Despite this, in 2012, the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa sponsored a bill in Parliament that would have effectively made all women in rural areas legal minors, subject to the whims of traditional chiefs. Had it become law, the bill would have created a separate legal system for millions of people living in rural areas. Chiefs would have been able to force their subjects to adhere to customary laws and practices that are outmoded and unconstitutional, and it would have been a crime for those living in areas covered by traditional courts to opt out and seek justice in the formal legal system.'b'This attempt to disenfranchise millions of women in one of Africa\xe2\x80\x99s most vibrant constitutional democracies demonstrates the extent to which advances in gender equality are often met with hostility.'b'Fortunately, the continent is home to loud and organized women\xe2\x80\x99s movements that have thus far been able to repel many attempts to undermine women\xe2\x80\x99s progress through protests and parliamentary campaigns and the creative use of media and technology.'b'Their protests have been daring and their collective message has been clear: The walk from the streets to the halls of power may be long, but the goal is well within reach.'b'ATLANTA \xe2\x80\x94 THE groundswell of protests over police brutality in the closing days of 2014, when people dropped to the marble floor of Grand Central Terminal and shut down the Brooklyn Bridge, blocked Lake Shore Drive in Chicago and chanted \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Breathe\xe2\x80\x9d from Boston to Oakland, summoned ghosts not only of the marches of the civil rights era but of the larger forces that led to the arrival of so many African-Americans in the big cities of the North and West in the first place.'b'Dozens of cities would ultimately join in these demonstrations of discontent. But a map of the largest protests those first nights, and of the high-profile cases of police violence in recent months, lit up like a map of the Great Migration: New York, Chicago, Cleveland, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Washington, Los Angeles, Oakland, all of them the major receiving stations of the movement. These were the places to which generations of African-Americans fled to escape the state-sanctioned violence their descendants have now faced in the North and West.'b'In matters of racial injustice, the South has been the center of attention since before the time of the Civil War. But the North, with its shorter history of a mass black population, has only more recently dealt with the paradox of an enlightened ideal coexisting with racial disparity. The protests have become a referendum on the black condition since the Great Migration. \xe2\x80\x9cThe protests are beginning to wake people up to the idea that the problems are not only there but have been obvious all along,\xe2\x80\x9d the historian Taylor Branch told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like the South in the 1950s.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was because of the Great Migration \xe2\x80\x94 six million black Southerners fleeing Jim Crow from World War I to the 1970s \xe2\x80\x94 that African-Americans now live in every state of the union. They were seeking political asylum within their own country in what was, in effect, one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest and longest mass demonstrations against injustice. It was barely recognized for what it was at the time, arising as it did organically, rather than from a single leader, much like the protests today. Both migrants and protesters were pleading with the world to take notice that something was terribly wrong in the places where they lived.'b'In the early decades of the 20th century, a caste system ruled the South with such repression that every four days an African-American was lynched for some perceived breach or mundane accusation \xe2\x80\x94 having stolen 75 cents or made off with a mule. Those conditions forced most every black family to consider the best course of action to feel safe and free. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere can we go,\xe2\x80\x9d a black woman in Alabama wrote in 1902, \xe2\x80\x9cto feel that security which other people feel?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Generations later, police killings of African-Americans occur as often as twice a week for at times mundane infractions and at three times the rate as for whites, according to conservative estimates from recent studies. What happens in the moments after these encounters reveals a disregard for black life as disturbing as the shootings themselves. In the case of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old with a toy gun who was shot within seconds of a squad car\xe2\x80\x99s arrival at a Cleveland park, new video released this week showed officers wrestling the boy\xe2\x80\x99s 14-year-old sister to the ground and handcuffing her as she appeared to run toward her bleeding brother.'b'Such cases force black families again to consider how to safeguard their children and themselves from the violence they suffer at a disproportionate rate at the hands of authorities assigned to protect them. They are still giving a version of the same talk their ancestors gave their children back in the old country of the South, about answering yes, sir, and no, sir, and watching how they comport themselves around the upper caste and the police.'b'Now, as then, those kitchen table discussions signal a painful coming to terms with one\xe2\x80\x99s tenuous condition in one\xe2\x80\x99s own land. What was little understood at the time of the migration was that the refugees from the South shared the same dreams as the immigrants who stepped off the ships at Ellis Island, huddled masses yearning to breathe free. One of the few contemporaneous studies in the early years of the migration, published by the Chicago Commission on Race Relations in 1922, surveyed Southern migrants to determine why they had come north and what they had hoped to find. The migrants responded:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom in voting and the conditions of the colored people here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom and chance to make a living.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom and opportunity to acquire something.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom of speech, right to live and work as other races.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFreedom of speech and action. Can live without fear, no Jim Crow.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those desires went little noticed. Indeed, it was resentment toward the Southerners\xe2\x80\x99 arrival and obstacles to their entering the mainstream of Northern life that helped create the current conditions. Northern cities had had limited exposure to African-Americans. These cities were ill-prepared to absorb large numbers of asylum seekers who stood out from the rest of the population.'b'And so the newcomers were met with suspicion. Often recruited as strikebreakers, they were denied access to some unions and trades and were paid the lowest wages for the dirtiest work. They were roped off into overcrowded ghettos by means of redlining and periodic firebombings of homes purchased by black residents who breached the de facto wall of segregation.'b'Unlike the immigrants from Europe, they could not shield themselves from the assumptions about their heritage or blend into the majority just by Anglicizing their names or mastering the senator\xe2\x80\x99s English. They stood out as the children of enslavement and Jim Crow, unable to escape the burden of a pained history.'b'It was a measure of how dire conditions were in the South that the Great Migration continued into the 1970s. When it began, 90 percent of all African-Americans were living in the South. By the time it ended, nearly half of all African-Americans lived elsewhere.'b'Notably, however, high profile-cases of police brutality have recently come to be associated with the North rather than the South. And it is in the South that two recent cases of police shootings of unarmed black people resulted in more vigorous prosecution. Last month, as protests raged over the deaths of Michael Brown in Missouri, Eric Garner in New York and John Crawford and Tamir Rice in Ohio, Randall Kerrick, a police officer in Charlotte, N.C., made his first court appearance on a charge of voluntary manslaughter in the 2013 death of 'b'Jonathan Ferrell'b'. Mr. Ferrell was an unarmed black motorist who was shot 10 times as he sought help after a car accident. In September, Sean Groubert, a South Carolina state trooper, was fired after shooting an unarmed man, 'b'Levar Jones'b', during a traffic stop over a seatbelt violation. In a widely circulated video of the incident, Mr. Jones asked the trooper with humbling composure, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I do, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d Then: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you shoot me?\xe2\x80\x9d He survived his injuries. The trooper was arrested and charged with aggravated assault and battery, a felony that carries a possible 20-year prison term.'b'The nation still has far to go, but this, at least, seems cause for hope. It suggests that the South, after decades of wrestling with its history, is now willing to face injustice head on. And it suggests that the North, after decades of insisting that it was fairer and more free, could eventually do the same.'b'It is not known what will come of the current upheaval in the North. The protests are a response to unprosecuted police brutality but are also a plea for recognition of African-Americans\xe2\x80\x99 humanity. How can success be measured when the goals are so basic and enduring? History tells us that enough people acting together can have an impact beyond what could be imagined. The Great Migration changed American culture as we know it, produced jazz and Motown, playwrights and novelists, and transformed the social geography of most every city outside of the South. At the start of the movement, one of its chroniclers put the migrants\xe2\x80\x99 aims in perspective. \xe2\x80\x9cIf all of their dream does not come true,\xe2\x80\x9d The Chicago Defender newspaper wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cenough will come to pass to justify their actions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the events of the last year have taught us anything, it is that, as much progress has been made over the generations, the challenges of color and tribe were not locked away in another century or confined to a single region but persist as a national problem and require the commitment of the entire nation to resolve.'b'Twice recently, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s president, Hassan Rouhani, has acted boldly in support of his biggest political gamble, pursuit of a nuclear agreement with the major powers. In 'b'a speech'b' last Sunday on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s troubled economy, he argued that Iran will never enjoy sustained growth if it is isolated from the rest of the world. Three weeks earlier, he made clear that he would confront Iran\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'hard-liners'b' in his efforts to clinch a deal in which Iran would agree never to produce a nuclear weapon in return for the lifting of crippling international sanctions.'b'But Mr. Rouhani is not the only leader trying to keep a potential agreement from being savaged by domestic opponents. President Obama has a similar problem in Congress, where Senators Robert Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, and Mark Kirk, a Republican from Illinois, are expected to introduce legislation that could torpedo any deal by imposing new sanctions on Iran, including tighter controls on its battered oil industry.'b'Negotiators for Iran and the major powers \xe2\x80\x94 the United States, Britain, France, China, Russia and Germany \xe2\x80\x94 resume their talks next week in Geneva. While they have made significant progress, they remain at odds over how large a nuclear program \xe2\x80\x94 geared for energy production and medical uses \xe2\x80\x94 Iran will be permitted to have.'b'Mr. Rouhani has shown his seriousness by openly challenging the Iranian hard-liners who are hostile to a deal and by appealing for support from intellectuals, academics, businesspeople and others who are open, even eager, for one. To rally political support, he has also hinted that he might bypass established power centers and submit the issue to a popular 'b'referendum'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cOur ideals are not bound to centrifuges,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rouhani said in reference to the nuclear program.'b'Mr. Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s path to compromise is not easy. Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s chief negotiator, won an informal 'b'vote of confidence'b' in Parliament on Tuesday after hard-liners forced him to answer questions on the nuclear talks. But Iran\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'supreme leader'b', Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who will have the last word on any agreement, voiced new doubts on Wednesday about whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 America \xe2\x80\x94 could be trusted to really lift sanctions.'b'His skepticism is not unfounded. President Obama has the authority to temporarily ease sanctions on Iran, and he has done that to a limited extent by allowing Iran to receive about $700 million per month in assets frozen abroad under the terms of an interim nuclear agreement that has been in place since November 2013.'b'Even so, the power to permanently lift most sanctions lies with Congress, where many members deeply mistrust Tehran, and Republican leaders have said that new and stronger sanctions are near the top of their to-do list in the new Congress. Such a move might be justified down the road if negotiations collapse, or if Iran cheats on its commitments. But at this stage it could easily undermine the talks, split the major powers and propel Iran to speed its nuclear development.'b'Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the new Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, says he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know where he will come down on any new sanctions legislation. But he is working to ensure that Congress gets a vote on any final nuclear agreement. His handling of the issue will be a major test of his leadership.'b'His pledge to \xe2\x80\x9cfigure out a way for Congress to weigh in\xe2\x80\x9d so that it improves the chances for a \xe2\x80\x9cgood outcome\xe2\x80\x9d is not unreasonable. If the deal is good and Congress approves it, that should reassure Iran\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader of America\xe2\x80\x99s commitment and improve the chances that the deal will \xe2\x80\x9cstand the test of time,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Corker told The New York Times. The question is whether such a vote could be exploited by opponents who would like to scuttle any deal.'b'A deal that is verifiable and significantly limits Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities can succeed if it both enhances regional security and benefits Iran. There will still be some risk for all sides. But the bigger risk is squandering this moment and leaving Iran free to pursue an unconstrained nuclear program. This would invite more sanctions, new tensions and perhaps even military action and a cyberattack.'b'Gasoline prices have fallen more than 40 percent since the end of June thanks to the collapse of global oil prices. That makes this the perfect time for Congress to overcome its longstanding terror of offending the nation\xe2\x80\x99s motorists and raise the tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. The results could only be beneficial: for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s roads, bridges and transit systems, which badly need repair; for the budget; and, to the extent that higher taxes encourage greater fuel efficiency, for the climate.'b'The federal excise tax of 18.4 cents per gallon on gas and 24.4 cents on diesel has not been increased since 1993. That has severely shortchanged the Highway Trust Fund, which is expected to run out of money 'b'in May'b' if Congress does not transfer more into it or raise fuel taxes. If the federal tax on gasoline had simply kept up with 'b'inflation'b', it would be 30 cents today.'b'There is little doubt that the nation\xe2\x80\x99s road and transit systems could use more help. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave them a 'b'nearly failing grade'b' of D in 2013; the state of bridges is somewhat better, earning a C-plus. The country\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate road and transit systems cost it billions through increased delays, extra fuel costs and auto repair bills. Poor road conditions are also said to play a significant factor in about one-third of all 'b'traffic fatalities'b', or about 10,000 deaths a year.'b'Some lawmakers, 'b'including some Republicans'b', are concerned enough about these trends to discuss an increase in fuel taxes. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, 'b'has proposed'b' increasing the tax, and Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma and a big supporter of the energy industry, has said he is 'b'willing to consider'b' it. Some state leaders are also considering raising their own fuel taxes. Lawmakers in Michigan have put a gas tax increase on the ballot for a May election, and Iowa lawmakers are also talking about a higher tax.'b'The Obama administration has not thrown its support behind an increase because it is afraid, it seems, of political blowback. A White House spokesman 'b'said last week'b' that the administration would prefer to find the money for roads, bridges, transit and other public works by closing corporate tax loopholes. That approach would require a much larger compromise with Republicans on tax policy, which seems unlikely. More important, it would not create the kind of dedicated and ongoing source of revenue the country\xe2\x80\x99s transportation system needs.'b'A modest increase in the gas tax phased in over a few months or a year would hardly be noticeable to most Americans, especially now that drivers have seen the cost of gasoline fall so much and so quickly \xe2\x80\x94 although some way should be found to offset the tax increase for low-income Americans, who would suffer most. The 'b'average retail price'b' of gasoline in the United States was $2.308 a gallon for the week ended Jan. 5, according to the Energy Information Administration; that is 'b'down from'b' $3.778 at the end of June. The E.I.A. estimates that the average American household 'b'will spend'b' $550 less on gas this year compared with 2014.'b'The Congressional Budget Office 'b'estimated'b' last year that Congress would have to raise fuel taxes by between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon to meet all of the obligations of the Highway Trust Fund. If lawmakers went with a 15-cent hike, that would add just $3 to the cost of a 20-gallon fill-up once the increase was fully phased in. To put that into context, Americans are saving nearly $30 on average for every 20 gallons of gas they buy thanks to the drop in oil prices. That is a small price to pay for better roads, bridges and transit systems.'b'For all the clich\xc3\xa9s about pistol-packing Texas, the state is one of the few that has not yet succumbed to the gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s big push to let citizens carry handguns at the hip wherever they go. That may be about to change as the State Legislature convenes next week with open carry a top priority of the Republican majority and with Governor-elect Greg Abbott pledging to sign it into law. The result could produce a far from reassuring civic tableau if even a modest number of the 800,000 Texans who have concealed-carry licenses choose to strap their weapons on in public.'b'In the antic ways of gun-rights zealotry, one group \xe2\x80\x94 Come and Take It Texas \xe2\x80\x94 is planning to promote the cause with an armed rally on Tuesday at the Capitol at which supporters will flaunt rifles and shotguns, which already are legally allowed for open carry. And should any lawmaker miss the point, the group is planning to use a 3-D printer to manufacture guns at the rally. The stunt, however, is creating division in the open carry ranks, with a rival group \xe2\x80\x94 Open Carry Texas \xe2\x80\x94 finding it counterproductive and planning a rally later in January where participants will wear empty holsters, according to 'b'The Texas Tribune'b'. Empty holsters are not much of a symbol of moderation, but gun safety advocates maintain hope that the issue might be derailed, as it was in the last Legislature.'b'The Austin debate is the latest barometer of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun culture, as it veers somewhere between eerie and lethal. In Newtown, Conn., where 20 children were shot dead in the 2012 school massacre, some victimized parents, rebuffed by Congress on stronger gun safety laws (and perhaps by recent polls showing waning popular support on the issue), have 'b'begun lawsuits'b' against the gun\xe2\x80\x99s manufacturer. They are rightly asking how a powerful weapon created for combat could ever have been marketed on the home front as a novelty. On the other hand, residents around Aurora, Colo., where 12 were shot to death and 70 wounded in the 2012 movie-house massacre, can now take advantage of a cut-rate 'b'Groupon offer'b' for supposed expert advice on how to wield the weapons many are buying and concealing.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s concerns and cautions about guns never quiet, particularly on the Internet. Lately, gun-rights counselors are advising women on how to better secure their handguns, so there\xe2\x80\x99s no repetition of the tragedy last month when an Idaho mom was shot dead at a Walmart as her 2-year-old son rummaged in her purse and fired her fully legal pistol. (\xe2\x80\x9cBra holsters are also on the market now.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'A new survey by 'b'The Associated Press'b' shows more gun sales than ever \xe2\x80\x94 over 500 a day \xe2\x80\x94 are slipping through the federal background check system. This is mainly because Congress set an unrealistic three-day limit on the Federal Bureau of Investigation for deciding whether a new sale can proceed. This is in a nation where, as of now, there are nine guns for every 10 people.'b'KISSING the sun. Swilling merlot.

The Times\xe2\x80\x99s First Draft did a Sherwin-Williams analysis of Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s strikingly darker hue, syncing it to a color called \xe2\x80\x9cHusky Orange.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And there were serious irritations, like another coup attempt by Tea Partiers eager to wreck the celebration of their party\xe2\x80\x99s congressional takeover.

And for good reason: Since the 18th century, when it bestrode Europe and seemed poised to dominate the globe, France has seen its relative power diminish, suffering defeats and humiliations at the hands of rival forces, from Britain\xe2\x80\x99s navies to Germany\xe2\x80\x99s jackboots to the invading might of American popular culture.'b'Now these longstanding anxieties have been thrown into relief by the murderous attack on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, an attack linked to all the various specters haunting contemporary France: fears of creeping Islamification and rising anti-Semitism, fears of the far right\xe2\x80\x99s growing power and anti-Muslim backlash \xe2\x80\x94 and all of it bound up in a larger sense, amid economic stagnation, of betrayal at the hands of the Continent\xe2\x80\x99s elite.'b'But notwithstanding these declinist fears, France isn\xe2\x80\x99t actually irrelevant or spent. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s arguably becoming more important, more central to the fate of Europe and the West.'b'No, the age of the Sun King isn\xe2\x80\x99t about to return. But politically, culturally, even intellectually, events in France over the next half-century could matter more than at any point since before the two world wars. Indeed, more than Germany or Greece or Britain or any other actor, it\xe2\x80\x99s in France that the fate of 21st-century Europe could ultimately be decided.'b'Consider the specific issue at the heart of the Hebdo nightmare: the question of whether European nation-states can successfully integrate Muslim immigrants, and what will happen if they don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Here France looks like the crucial test case. It has the largest Muslim population of any major European country, and parts of that population are more assimilated and others far more radicalized (16 percent of French citizens expressed 'b'support for the Islamic State'b' in a poll last summer) than elsewhere on the Continent.'b'Not surprisingly, the response to Islam is divided as well: Muslims are regarded 'b'more favorably in France'b' than elsewhere in Western Europe, and yet French politics features an increasingly potent far-right party, Marine Le Pen\xe2\x80\x99s National Front, whose electoral clout is now likely to increase. Meanwhile, France\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy has distinctive (often military) entanglements across Northern Africa and the Levant, which means the ripples from French domestic politics have more room to spread and then return.'b'So if there\xe2\x80\x99s a path to greater Muslim assimilation and inclusion, it\xe2\x80\x99s more likely to be pioneered in France. If Islamic radicalism is going to gain ground or mutate into something more pervasive and dangerous, it\xe2\x80\x99s also more likely to happen in France\xe2\x80\x99s sphere of influence than elsewhere. And if Europe\xe2\x80\x99s much-feared far right is going to complete its journey from the fringe to the mainstream, it will probably happen first in Paris.'b'French politics is likewise central to the fate of the wider European Union project, which is in crisis at the moment because of the gulf between Germany\xe2\x80\x99s interests and the interests of the E.U. periphery, Greece and Italy and Spain. But that gulf (and the weight of 20th-century history) means that the Germans, however economically dominant, cannot hold the union together on their own. Instead it\xe2\x80\x99s France, for reasons of 'b'history and culture'b' as well as geography, that has to bridge the divide between Europe\xe2\x80\x99s north and south and make the E.U. work politically. Unless, of course, the French gradually and fatefully choose not to, in which case the entire project will fall apart or be completely reconceived.'b'Either way, France\xe2\x80\x99s star may rise as Germany\xe2\x80\x99s descends. Demography, the source of so much Gallic anxiety in the past, suddenly has turned in France\xe2\x80\x99s favor: The Germans are rich but aging, whereas even amid economic drift the French birthrate has risen sharply (suggesting a certain optimism amid the ennui). By the 2050s, under some scenarios, France could once again have the 'b'larger economy'b' and 'b'population'b' \xe2\x80\x94 making it either dominant in a more integrated Europe, or the most important power on a continent more divided than today.'b'Then amid these political and economic patterns there\xe2\x80\x99s an important intellectual possibility \xe2\x80\x94 namely, that if there\xe2\x80\x99s something beyond the West\xe2\x80\x99s current end-of-history torpor, some new ideological conflict or synthesis, it might emerge first in the place where so many revolutions had their birth.'b'France has always been a country of extremes\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa0absolutist and republican, Catholic and anticlerical, Communist and fascist. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s once again the place where strong forces are colliding, and where the culture\xe2\x80\x99s uncertainties \xe2\x80\x94 about Islam, secularism, nationalism, Europe; about 'b'modernity itself'b' \xe2\x80\x94 suggest that new ones might soon be born.'b'The decline has been real, but the future is unwritten. If there is real history yet to be made in Europe, for good or ill, it might be made first in la belle France.'b'THE thriller writer Jeffery Deaver has released an original work called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Starling Project\xe2\x80\x9d as an audiobook \xe2\x80\x94 only it\xe2\x80\x99s not what we think of as an audiobook: a printed book read aloud that you can listen to on your laptop or phone. Featuring 29 actors in more than 80 speaking roles combined with \xe2\x80\x9cstate-of-the-art sound and music design,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Deaver\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbook\xe2\x80\x9d was conceived as an audio drama for Audible. There are no plans to turn it into a traditional text-based book, either on paper or digitally.'b'That was fast. First we went from books to e-books, and now we\xe2\x80\x99re going from e-books to no-books. What\xe2\x80\x99s next? Books embedded in a chip that delivers \xe2\x80\x9ccontent\xe2\x80\x9d directly into our brains?'b'Is such an innovation even necessary? When you think about it, that\xe2\x80\x99s what audio does now. Listening is more efficient than reading: When we read, we absorb print with our eyes and translate it into \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning,\xe2\x80\x9d a cumbersome process that requires us first to see the words, then to make sense of them, and finally to employ our imaginations to conjure up events and sounds and characters that aren\xe2\x80\x99t there. Reception by aural means is more direct: All you have to do is listen. Not only that, you can multitask, driving to work or walking the dog.'b'The simplicity of audio is turning out to be a big advantage for those who love telling stories. To produce a show \xe2\x80\x94 or a non-text-based book \xe2\x80\x94 is relatively cheap. All you need is a writer, a studio with tech support, a few characters and, before you know it, you have \xe2\x80\x9cSerial.\xe2\x80\x9d More people have listened to this wildly popular podcast (nearly five million downloads per episode) about a teenage murder trial than have read Karl Ove Knausgaard\xe2\x80\x99s Proust-length memoir or Elena Ferrante\xe2\x80\x99s trilogy.'b'The podcast, once a form of talk show for the iPhone age, is evolving into a new literary form \xe2\x80\x94 one so new that it\xe2\x80\x99s soon going to require a name of its own. Whatever it\xe2\x80\x99s called, I have become addicted to it. Yes, I still read books, in increasing number now that you can impulse-buy Hermione Lee\xe2\x80\x99s biography of Penelope Fitzgerald while you\xe2\x80\x99re shivering at a bus stop and have it show up on your Kindle reader almost instantly.

But who\xe2\x80\x99s going to put up the money it takes to produce podcasts as they become more ambitious?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStartUp\xe2\x80\x9d would make a great magazine piece, but it\xe2\x80\x99s even more absorbing when you can actually listen to Mr. Blumberg discussing with his wife what he should wear to a meeting with a venture capitalist. As he\xe2\x80\x99s going out the door, she says: \xe2\x80\x9cAre you meeting someone with money?\xe2\x80\x9d He acknowledges that he is. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99d be a higher chance that he\xe2\x80\x99s going to give you money if you\xe2\x80\x99re not wearing running shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d she points out. Mr. Blumberg changes his shoes. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very funny exchange, and even funnier when you hear their voices: the aspiring entrepreneur sheepish, his wife gently ironic.'b'Listening to Mr. Blumberg describe his meeting with the venture capitalist at a sushi restaurant on Pico Boulevard in Los Angeles (I love all these details; they remind me of ... books), I think: Dude, give him the money.

By Episode 6, someone has decided to invest \xe2\x80\x94 the venture capitalist guy from lunch.'b'There are obvious limits to the podcast as a literary genre. It can be hard to keep track of all those voices, and the dialogue can feel slack. I was bored at times by the casual \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s just talk into the microphone\xe2\x80\x9d style of \xe2\x80\x9cSerial.\xe2\x80\x9d But at its best it has the tension of those nonfiction classics of an earlier era \xe2\x80\x94 Truman Capote\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cIn Cold Blood\xe2\x80\x9d or Norman Mailer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cExecutioner\xe2\x80\x99s Song.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Listening to a podcast is like watching a movie, listening to music and reading a book all at once. You become attached to the characters, caught up in the story, enthralled by the writing. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery other format is going to shorter and shorter content pieces, so you\xe2\x80\x99re actually swimming upstream,\xe2\x80\x9d the venture capitalist says to Mr. Blumberg. But maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re sick of short attention spans. Maybe we 'b'want 'b'to pay attention.'b'The question arises, Who has time to listen to all these programs? How will we even know what\xe2\x80\x99s out there? My guess is that gatekeepers will arise in the form of targeted magazine-like sites; critics will review them; teachers will teach them. It\xe2\x80\x99s already happening: Robert Boynton, director of the literary reportage concentration at the Arthur L.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to one called \xe2\x80\x9cHomemade Stories\xe2\x80\x9d by a Chicago-based black writer named Shannon Cason. Many of Mr. Cason\xe2\x80\x99s stories revolve around his encounters with the police, which seem to happen every time he walks out the door.'b'In the wake of Ferguson and Staten Island and now Cleveland, his account of going for a stroll with his family and being accosted by the police is chilling. \xe2\x80\x9cI told you to watch your surroundings, Anthony, and stop wearing that damn hoodie,\xe2\x80\x9d his wife upbraids their teenage son, who has just been grabbed by a police officer and was about to be thrown atop the hood of a squad car.

But what is particularly galling is that several other countries serve as models of concern for their populace, and yet we ignore those lessons.'b'As you recently reported, Danish fast-food companies 'b'pay'b' their unionized workers at least $20 an hour, with benefits including five weeks of paid vacation. Fast-food workers in America earn an average of less than $9 an hour, contributing to the tens of millions of working poor who are forced to rely on government assistance to survive.'b'In most European countries mothers receive professional parenting support and almost full pay for many months in order to be with their newborns; we are the only developed country to have no maternity leave policy. And sadly we accept too easily that one in five of our children grow up in poverty, more than in most other developed countries.'b'Nor are we troubled that these other countries proudly provide all their citizens with complete medical coverage. Here many of our Republican-led states have, for political reasons, refused to take the 100 percent financing from Washington to extend Medicaid to more people.'b'On most indexes of people\xe2\x80\x99s well-being, the United States lags far behind comparable nations. The time has come for Americans to acknowledge that we as a nation are failing our citizens. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough pill to swallow but an essential stimulant to political action, both in the streets and in the polling booths, to right the deplorable way we allow our enormous wealth to be used for private rather than public purposes.'b'The quest for an American exceptionalism of which we could once again be proud has the potential for bringing our nation together across political lines.

And, of course, it was a place full of prosperous corporations and individuals, their rise manifestly unimpeded (in any meaningful way) by the stronger social contract.'b'It can be done, folks. If we in American perceive public and private goods as locked in an unending, zero-sum struggle, with private gain ever the preferred winner, it is not because it has to be that way. It is because our political conversation has been hijacked by selfish and parochial moneyed interests.'b'The choice is ours.

Governments in relatively small, ethnically homogeneous countries, notably in Scandinavia, have had the easiest time redistributing wealth to achieve social goals. Social science strongly indicates an inverse relationship at the national level between diversity and support for social spending. Growing diversity due to migration and low European birthrates is posing a challenge to political support for social spending, even in traditionally very generous countries.'b'The national contexts for decisions on social welfare policy vary greatly.

And so conflicting solutions are proposed and little common ground is easily found.'b'But at this point, we know enough to be able to say, for example, that good prenatal care and early childhood education help individuals grow and thrive and also save public dollars for health care and criminal justice, at least in the long run. We know that increasing wages of low-income workers results in a better quality of life for them and their families and also improves the economy because those workers spend most of what they make.'b'There is common ground here, and there is no reason we can\xe2\x80\x99t rise above our impulse to oversimplify things and instead work for the betterment of all.'b'HILL GRIMMETT'b' Fort Collins, Colo., Jan. 7, 2015'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b'Mr. Salz\xe2\x80\x99s quest for \xe2\x80\x9can American exceptionalism of which we could once again be proud\xe2\x80\x9d sows the seeds of its own demise.

With cultural issues less crucial in the minds of conservative voters, now is the time for a progressive leadership, an Elizabeth Warren, a Bernie Sanders, perhaps even Hillary Clinton, to move the conversation forward on the biggest stage possible, and in ways that might eventually lead to legislation limiting the power of politically active corporations.'b'Mr. Clark\xe2\x80\x99s firsthand report on Switzerland describes how that country provides the necessary supportive environment for all its people, including its indigent, to live productive lives, without threatening corporate profits. So with interest piqued as to how other countries do it, we inform our citizens of the success of the Danish fast-food union winning $20 an hour through collective bargaining, and the fact that Ikea pays its furniture production workers in Sweden about twice what it pays workers in its Danville, Va., plant. Then let everyone look at the M.I.T. Living Wage Calculator with its picture of the shocking gap between typical American wages and what is required to provide bare-bones support for a family, and all this information might just move Americans to demand a resurgent labor movement.'b'Couple this with an education from the Nobel Prize-winning economists Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman as to the benefits of a sharply progressive income tax, a financial transaction tax, and other fiscal policies to raise sufficient revenue, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve created a nation of progressives. But all this takes time.'b'Finally, Mr. Terzuolo is correct that increased immigration in Europe has led to small but growing hostility toward the foreign-born and the benefits they receive, and anger is likely to increase after the attack in Paris. But the percentage of immigrants in those countries is comparable to, or in some cases higher than, the United States, and to date there has been little change in their social welfare policies.'b'I also agree with Mr. Terzuolo that one cannot automatically transfer social welfare policies from one country to another. But certainly nations can learn from the successes of other countries, and then adapt those policies to one\xe2\x80\x99s own situations.'b'ARTHUR SALZ'b' Kew Gardens, Queens, Jan. 8, 2015'b''b'THE only time art ever seems to make news here in the West anymore is when a Pollock or Warhol sells for a sum commensurate with the budget of a \xe2\x80\x9cTransformers\xe2\x80\x9d film. It seems bizarre, then, to find ourselves grappling with international crises in which art is the issue: the imbroglio involving the Sony movie \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview,\xe2\x80\x9d the massacre at Charlie Hebdo in Paris. The incomprehension, whether bemused or horrified, that we feel toward people who take up arms against the creators of cartoons or comedies is a chastening reminder that there are still cultures in which art is not a harmless diversion or commodity, but something real and volatile, a potential threat to be violently suppressed. These attacks are, in a way, a savage, atavistic show of respect.'b'I was a cartoonist for The Baltimore City Paper from 1997 to 2009, so I well know what influence a political cartoonist wields in this country. The last time art had any real-world effect on United States politics was about 140 years ago, when Boss Tweed was not only driven from power by Thomas Nast\xe2\x80\x99s caricatures of him but ultimately arrested after he\xe2\x80\x99d fled to Spain, where he was recognized from those same cartoons.'b'Much as I admire Steve Bell\xe2\x80\x99s caricatures of George W. Bush as a dung-flinging chimpanzee, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine them landing the former president in The Hague. Most daily editorial cartoonists in the United States produce work about as incisive as a prime-time sitcom, and the rest are consigned to niche markets where they preach to their demographic choirs. I have to wonder whether any of my colleagues felt the same queasy mix of emotions I did on hearing about the assassinations in Paris: beneath the outrage, sorrow and solidarity, a small, irrational twinge of guilt that we\xe2\x80\x99re not doing anything worth shooting us over.'b'Kurt Vonnegut Jr. likened the cumulative firepower of all the art and literature directed against the Vietnam War to \xe2\x80\x9cthe explosive force of a very large banana-cream pie \xe2\x80\x94 a pie two meters in diameter, 20 centimeters thick, and dropped from a height of 10 meters or more.\xe2\x80\x9d A lot of artists in America tend to be self-deprecating futilitarians, because we\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up in a culture in which art doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter except, occasionally, as a high-end investment. When art has been controversial here it\xe2\x80\x99s most often been because it\xe2\x80\x99s deemed obscene. (Sex is our tawdry Muhammad, the thing that cannot be depicted.) But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of a time in our recent history when art gave any cause for alarm to anyone in power.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a testament to the brittleness and fragility of ideologies like the thuggish cult of North Korea and the more homicidally literalist sects of Islam that they react so violently to art most Westerners regard as silly and trivial: dumb comedies, crude cartoons. North Korea saw \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview\xe2\x80\x9d as some sort of invidious state-sponsored attack on its revered leader, the cinematic equivalent of a dirty bomb. It was almost endearing; you wanted to explain to them, No, see, in our country, this is 'b'stupid'b' art. We weren\xe2\x80\x99t even going to go see it in theaters until you threatened to bomb them; we would\xe2\x80\x99ve waited for it on instant streaming. Some part of the international reaction to the Charlie Hebdo massacre was this same kind of condescending incredulity: Wait, this was about 'b'cartoons'b'?'b'It speaks well of our own relatively flexible system that it can accommodate criticism and dissent without lopping anyone\xe2\x80\x99s hands off. But this is also a backhanded testament to our society\xe2\x80\x99s successful denaturing of satire, and the impotence of art in our own culture. Autocrats from Plato on have advocated control and censorship of the arts to ensure the stability of their states and micromanage their people\xe2\x80\x99s inner lives. In the mature democracies of the West, there\xe2\x80\x99s no longer any need for purges or fatwas or book-burnings. Why waste bullets shooting artists when you can just not pay them? Why bother banning books when nobody reads anyway, and the national literature is so provincial, insular and narcissistic it poses no troublesome questions?'b'The real Machiavellian genius of the First Amendment is that free speech turns out to be mostly harmless \xe2\x80\x94 a lot of P.C. nit-picking, dingbat conspiracy theories, tedious libertarian screeds and name calling. The only \xe2\x80\x9cfree speech\xe2\x80\x9d that has any effect in a stable, well-run plutocracy is the kind protected by Buckley vs. Valeo in the form of campaign contributions.'b'American capitalism has its own ingenious system for neutralizing or absorbing dissent: Any art that challenges its fundamental assumptions, its inevitability and rightness, is either ignored, so the artist has to tend bar or learn graphic design, or, if it becomes successful, lavishly rewarded and painlessly welcomed into the system it criticized. As systems of oppression go, this is definitely the one you want to suffer under. Getting paid only 20 bucks a week for my political cartoons was kind of insulting, but at least I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t forced to eat them at gunpoint.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m relieved to live in a place where the worst thing I have to worry about is being called names on the Internet. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to romanticize what happened in Paris: It was obscene and stupid and sad. And yet there is also occasion for pride in it, the kind of somber pride any soldier is entitled to feel in a comrade\xe2\x80\x99s sacrifice. It is a reminder that art is not a frivolous diversion, not just a product or \xe2\x80\x9ccontent.\xe2\x80\x9d It is still alive and dangerous, and still hated and feared by those most deserving of our mockery.'b'A lot of people are calling the cartoonists of Charlie Hebdo \xe2\x80\x9cheroes,\xe2\x80\x9d which it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine happening while they were still alive. (Would Seth Rogen be one if the North Koreans poisoned him?) But if grown-ups are going to use a word as childish as \xe2\x80\x9chero\xe2\x80\x9d at all, then I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid we may have to apply it, now and then, not only to those uniformed few who control drones from Langley or Vegas or bust teenagers selling weed on the street but also to silly, irrelevant people like cartoonists.'b'Last week, we quietly added a few more names to the roll call. And tonight, in the real ceremony, my colleagues and I will salute them with the traditional instruments of our trade \xe2\x80\x94 glasses raised around tables in the bars and cafes and tea houses of the civilized world. And, after a few, we\xe2\x80\x99ll do what cartoonists do \xe2\x80\x94 make cruel, gleeful fun of Islamic wackos and right-wing bigots, opportunistic politicians and useless cartoonists, absolutely everyone. No one will be spared.'b'YEARS ago, while producing the hit TV series \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shield,\xe2\x80\x9d Glen Mazzara noticed that two young female writers were quiet during story meetings. He pulled them aside and encouraged them to speak up more.'b'Watch what happens when we do, they replied.'b'Almost every time they started to speak, they were interrupted or shot down before finishing their pitch. When one had a good idea, a male writer would jump in and run with it before she could complete her thought.'b'Sadly, their experience is not unusual.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve both seen it happen again and again. When a woman speaks in a professional setting, she walks a tightrope. Either she\xe2\x80\x99s barely heard or she\xe2\x80\x99s judged as too aggressive. When a man says virtually the same thing, heads nod in appreciation for his fine idea. As a result, women often decide that saying less is more.'b'Some new studies support our observations. A 'b'study'b' by a Yale psychologist, Victoria L. Brescoll, found that male senators with more power (as measured by tenure, leadership positions and track record of legislation passed) spoke more on the Senate floor than their junior colleagues. But for female senators, power was not linked to significantly more speaking time.'b'Suspecting that powerful women stayed quiet because they feared a backlash, Professor Brescoll looked deeper. She 'b'asked 'b'professional men and women to evaluate the competence of chief executives who voiced their opinions more or less frequently. Male executives who spoke more often than their peers were rewarded with 10 percent higher ratings of competence. When female executives spoke more than their peers, both men and women punished them with 14 percent lower ratings. As this and other research shows, women who worry that talking \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much\xe2\x80\x9d will cause them to be disliked are not paranoid; they are often right.'b'One of us, Adam, was dismayed to find similar patterns when studying a 'b'health care company'b' and advising an international bank. When male employees contributed ideas that brought in new revenue, they got significantly higher performance evaluations. But female employees who spoke up with equally valuable ideas did not improve their managers\xe2\x80\x99 perception of their performance. Also, the more the men spoke up, the more helpful their managers believed them to be. But when women spoke up more, there was no increase in their perceived helpfulness.'b'This speaking-up double bind harms organizations by depriving them of valuable ideas. A University of Texas researcher, Ethan Burris, conducted 'b'an experiment'b' in which he asked teams to make strategic decisions for a bookstore. He randomly informed one member that the bookstore\xe2\x80\x99s inventory system was flawed and gave that person data about a better approach. In subsequent analyses, he found that when women challenged the old system and suggested a new one, team leaders viewed them as less loyal and were less likely to act on their suggestions. Even when all team members were informed that one member possessed unique information that would benefit the group, suggestions from women with inside knowledge were discounted.'b'Obviously, businesses need to find ways to 'b'interrupt'b' this gender bias. Just as orchestras that use blind auditions 'b'increase the number of women who are selected,'b' organizations can increase women\xe2\x80\x99s contributions by adopting practices that focus less on the speaker and more on the idea. For example, in 'b'innovation tournament'b's, employees submit suggestions and solutions to problems anonymously. Experts evaluate the proposals, give feedback to all participants and then implement the best plans.'b'SINCE most work cannot be done anonymously, leaders must also take steps to encourage women to speak and be heard. At \xe2\x80\x9cThe Shield,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mazzara, the show runner, found a clever way to change the dynamics that were holding those two female employees back. He announced to the writers that he was instituting a no-interruption rule while anyone \xe2\x80\x94 male or female \xe2\x80\x94 was pitching. It worked, and he later observed that it made the entire team more effective.'b'The long-term solution to the double bind of speaking while female is to increase the number of women in leadership roles. (As we noted in 'b'our previous article'b', 'b'research'b' shows that when it comes to leadership skills, although men are more confident, women are more competent.) As 'b'more women enter'b' the upper echelons of organizations, people become more accustomed to women\xe2\x80\x99s contributing and leading. Professor Burris and his colleagues studied a credit union where women made up 74 percent of supervisors and 84 percent of front-line employees. Sure enough, when women spoke up there, they were more likely to be heard than men. When President Obama held his last news conference of 2014, he called on eight reporters \xe2\x80\x94 all women. It made headlines worldwide. Had a politician given only men a chance to ask questions, it would not have been news; it would have been a regular day.'b'As 2015 starts, we wonder what would happen if we all held Obama-style meetings, offering women the floor whenever possible. Doing this for even a day or two might be a powerful bias interrupter, demonstrating to our teams and colleagues that speaking while female is still quite difficult. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to try it to see what we learn. We hope you will, too \xe2\x80\x94 and then share your experiences with us all 'b'on Facebook'b' or in the comments section.'b''b'This is the second of four essays in a series on women at work.'b''b'GRAND GOAVE, Haiti \xe2\x80\x94 Five years is an eternity in the news cycle of natural disasters. It\xe2\x80\x99s been that long since the 2010 'b'Haiti'b' earthquake killed hundreds of thousands of people (no one really knows how many died) and triggered an influx of international aid (an exact accounting remains elusive). Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s trauma has been eclipsed by Oklahoma tornadoes, Pacific typhoons and New York hurricanes. The world moves on.'b'Over the last five years, working as an architect here on reconstruction projects, I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed some physical and social recovery. But the disheartening reality is that Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s post-quake economy is identical to its pre-disaster model: Haitians remain dependent on foreign donations to maintain their subsistence existence. NGOs with tunnel vision and international aid agencies with top-down agendas hobble the weak government and cite Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s culture of corruption as an excuse to deny distributing aid through local channels. Economic autonomy is not disaster relief\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective. But Haiti will be a global stepchild until it makes something people want to buy.'b'Different countries have relative economic strengths. The United States fosters innovation, China excels at production, but Haiti barely participates in the global economy. Yet as a low-wage country close to the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest consumer market, it offers advantages. Shipping goods from Haiti is a bargain because containers importing humanitarian aid often leave here empty. Its annual exports are about a third of neighboring Jamaica and less than half of its African cousins Mali and Senegal.'b'Yet Haiti faces big impediments to becoming a successful exporter of manufactured goods. A history of unstable governments and restrictive policies on foreign investment keep multinational corporations away. Convoluted bureaucracies and corruption make business transactions difficult. An unreliable workforce impedes efficiency.'b'Haiti has survived as an insular country since 1804, after a revolution by slaves brought independence from France. Since then, its revolving-door governments have inconsistently invited and spurned foreign investment. Corporate and political distrust still run strong, and this extends to humanitarian efforts. Less than one percent of earthquake-disaster relief and only 15 percent of reconstruction projects have been channeled through the Haitian government.'b'Over the last five years I\xe2\x80\x99ve witnessed how these problems cripple the country. I designed and supervised construction of an orphanage and school in Grand Goave, 15 miles west of the quake\xe2\x80\x99s epicenter. Both projects, the largest reconstruction efforts in Grand Goave, used American volunteers and paid Haitian crews to construct quake-resistant buildings adapted from Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s traditional concrete construction. We were fortunate to have a Haitian-based organization coordinate land acquisition, road access and the few approvals required.'b'But obtaining raw materials was difficult. After the earthquake, prices spiked for items like steel reinforcing. Other materials, like cement, simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be found. Specialties, from construction tools to shower curtains, had to be imported from the United States. Delivery times were erratic. A truckload of electrical panels and fixtures delivered to the Port of Miami at the end of May arrived in Haiti just before the American Labor Day weekend in early September, only to be slapped with an arbitrary customs fee.'b'Exporting goods from Haiti is not any easier. The U.S. Department of Commerce reports the time required to process goods for export is more than 24 days, the longest in the Western Hemisphere. Products from Thailand have much further to travel, but they can get to the United States much faster.'b'The biggest impediment I witnessed to Haiti becoming economically viable is the struggle to create consistent quality on a predictable schedule. Some days we were able to pour 30 cubic yards of concrete by hand bucket in six hours; other days we labored into the night and fell short of that result. My business experience provided little guidance for this dilemma, but a book by the historian Laurent Dubois offered insight. In \xe2\x80\x9cHaiti: The Aftershocks of History,\xe2\x80\x9d he describes the operation of so-called lakou, small-scale cooperatives that bundled land ownership and production to circumvent government attempts to create export-scale agriculture and reap the resulting tariffs.'b'The Haitian penchant to thwart \xe2\x80\x9cthe man,\xe2\x80\x9d whether French slave owners or greedy presidents, U.S. Marines or paternalistic aid organizations, is more than an economic gambit; it\xe2\x80\x99s a point of pride. Haitians do not work for money alone. They cherish their independence above all. Their pride in being the first black republic is so palpable one might think they achieved freedom 10 years ago, not 210 years ago.'b'I learned the only way to get things done was to make our objectives align. Sometimes that meant reminding the men that ours was a community effort; sometimes it meant pitching in to erase the line between labor and management. Nothing motivates Haitians more than \xe2\x80\x9ctrumping the blan\xe2\x80\x9d (the Creole word for foreigner). Often this meant doing consciously silly things, such as teetering on a scaffold to demonstrate their superior balance.'b'Our school and orphanage are welcome additions to the community, but a town with orphanages and no factories is still a place of dependency. Yet no aid agency or private concern is introducing manufacturing to Grand Goave.'b'Haiti needs to create a unique economic model, a 21st-century lakou that bypasses a top-down system in favor of small enterprises multiplied many times over. This is already happening, albeit on a tiny scale. During my first year working in Haiti, I searched online for Haitian-related holiday gifts. There was nothing \xe2\x80\x94 absolutely nothing \xe2\x80\x94 for sale from Haiti. Now there are dozens of sites offering goods produced here. Although they consist mostly of nonprofit organizations selling crafts, they\xe2\x80\x99ve contributed to the 3-to-4 percent growth in Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product every year since 2012.'b'This trend can expand if the government improves the environment for entrepreneurs: Make it easier to establish small businesses; smooth transportation obstacles; devote less effort to seeking large corporations; nurture local resources.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s little to lose. NGO\xe2\x80\x99s and aid organizations have improved conditions, but they are often poorly coordinated and lack the scope to propel self-sufficiency. The government is widely perceived as being hobbled by corruption. It needs to demonstrate a new honesty and transparency; capitalize on the NGO presence by coordinating their work, monitoring their progress and directing their vision. Well-coordinated aid could lead to a new, decentralized, economic model. When that occurs, all sorts of interesting things will rise out of Haiti. Including something I\xe2\x80\x99ll want to buy.'b'Things are heating up.'b'KARACHI, PAKISTAN \xe2\x80\x94 In a rare convergence of views, conservative religious political parties and mainstream liberals in Pakistan seem to agree it is a terrible idea to allow special military courts to try suspected terrorists. But they think so for different reasons, highlighting that once again Pakistan is both polarized and confused about how to respond to terrorism.'b'Last Tuesday, the National Assembly and the Senate unanimously adopted (with abstentions but no votes against) the 21st amendment to the Constitution: For two years, military courts will have authority to adjudicate cases involving civilians suspected of links to terrorist organizations. The president approved the law the next day.'b'This is the first major initiative the government has pushed through since the new National Action Plan to counter terrorism was drawn up last month. After the Pakistani Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s rampage on an army-run school in Peshawar on Dec. 16, the government\xe2\x80\x99s immediate, and vengeful, response was to lift a moratorium on the death penalty. But then it put forward a comprehensive program that goes well beyond the usual antiterrorist military operations. Among other measures, the National Action Plan calls for cracking down on hate speech and attacks on religious minorities and for regulating Islamic seminaries.'b'Both the public and parties across the political spectrum have hailed the plan for its holistic approach. Even the opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or P.T.I., which has led antigovernment protests for months and is generally reluctant to condemn Islamists, came out in support of the government\xe2\x80\x99s new counterterrorism strategy.'b'But what did the government do last week by passing the constitutional amendment? Instead of revamping the criminal justice system, as the new action plan called for, it cited the failings of civilian courts, such as backlogs and corruption, to increase the remit of military courts: In other words, it ceded yet more control to an armed services that already dominates security and foreign policy making. And with that, it crushed hopes that Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 which has spent half of its history under martial law \xe2\x80\x94 was undergoing a democratic transition after the May 2013 election, the first in which power was transferred from one civilian government to another through the ballot box.'b'Last week\xe2\x80\x99s amendment to the Constitution is a step backward; civilian courts had been enjoying unprecedented independence in recent years, after a long history of operating at the military\xe2\x80\x99s behest and on occasion providing it legal cover for unconstitutional takeovers. The move also increases the risk of human rights violations against terrorist suspects since the special military courts\xe2\x80\x99 decisions will not be subject to appeal.'b'Like other progressive Pakistanis, I was even more dismayed to realize that political parties with purportedly liberal agendas supported the amendment, and despite understanding it would be a setback for democracy. Members of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party refused to vote for the law on Monday, Jan. 5, because that was the birthday of the party\xe2\x80\x99s founder, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, a former prime minister and president of Pakistan who is seen as an icon of democracy. They just voted for it the next day. One P.P.P. leader said he had done so against his conscience. Another called the amendment a \xe2\x80\x9cbitter pill\xe2\x80\x9d that was required to save the country.'b'Some parties abstained, such as the right-wing religious groups Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam. But this was not in the interest of democracy; it was because the amendment applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany terrorist group, armed group, wing and militia or their members using name of religion or a sect.\xe2\x80\x9d These religious parties, which are accused of maintaining links with the Taliban and Al Qaeda, fear that the new law will mean more security crackdowns on religious groups and seminaries.'b'The already confused and confusing debate about extremism in Pakistan has just become even more fraught. In the name of keeping the military out of civilian affairs, Pakistani liberals now find themselves having to defend a criminal justice system they have been criticizing for being sympathetic to extremist groups. (In the past Pakistani lawyers have feted the assassin of a politician critical of anti-blasphemy laws, and banned the sale at bar association canteens of drinks made at factories owned by Ahmadi Muslims, a sect they consider heretical.) And conservative religious political parties are having to take a stance against the military, even though historically they have enjoyed its patronage and formed governments with its backing as part of a strategy to sideline secular political parties.'b'Yet the greatest contradiction of all is that so many parliamentarians \xe2\x80\x94 including 247 members of the National Assembly \xe2\x80\x94 would vote to empower the military when many of them distrust it. Journalists and politicians, including the former head of P.T.I., believe the military may have orchestrated the antigovernment protests last year in the hope of triggering early elections. But now some of these politicians appear to be kowtowing to the army, presumably so they can complete their terms in office.'b'They seem to think they must sacrifice democracy in order to save it. But how soon will there be too little of it left to save?'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Liberation of Growing Old'b',\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 4):'b'Nelson Mandela was 89 when he and others formed the Elders, a group of global leaders.

As the Israeli government leads us further from peace, and the army faithfully executes its violent orders, this is the kind of treachery we need most.'b'DURHAM, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 WITH Washington bitterly divided between a Democratic White House and a Republican Congress, it seems unlikely that America will see substantive progress on the grand challenges of the day, ranging from immigration to energy policy and entitlement programs.'b'At times like these, we have historically looked to our 50 states to be, as Justice Louis D. Brandeis memorably 'b'called'b' them, laboratories of democracy, testing grounds for innovative policies that can be replicated by other states or translated to the federal level.'b'Some of the most notable federal policy innovations of the last generation have originated in the states, including school vouchers, energy efficiency standards, welfare reform and the Affordable Care Act. Governors like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush leveraged their state policy successes as springboards to the Oval Office.'b'The problem is, just when we need their innovative energies, the states are looking less and less likely to be fountainheads of new federal policy over the next generation.'b'What has changed? First, state politics have become much more partisan. After the 2014 elections, 60 percent of the states are completely controlled by a single party. The power of state policy innovations is that they traditionally had bipartisan fingerprints, allowing an enterprising national politician from either party to lay claim to them. In the new world of single-party states, very little bipartisan legislation will emerge.'b'We will see no Democrat willing to adopt the radical tax reforms of Gov. Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, and surely no Republican could champion the 'b'Safe Act'b' that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, got passed in New York \xe2\x80\x94 one of the strictest gun control bills in the nation.'b'Of course, these ideas may diffuse to other like-minded states. But more likely, these new initiatives will be at one end of the political spectrum or the other, limiting the potential for federal adoption.'b'Second, it has become clear that \xe2\x80\x9cscaling\xe2\x80\x9d successful state policies is harder than it appears, because of both political forces and policy realities. Every technocrat in Washington dreams of finding a successful policy at the state level, an early childhood education program in North Carolina or a creative prison reform initiative in Texas, and using it as a model for federal legislation. The logic is that once a state \xe2\x80\x9claboratory\xe2\x80\x9d has tested and approved a particular policy innovation, it will have the same \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment\xe2\x80\x9d effect in the other 49 states.'b'But that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been the case. Increasingly, efforts to \xe2\x80\x9cfederalize\xe2\x80\x9d state innovations have been hobbled by political backlash. The Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s Race to the Top program used billions of dollars of prize money to persuade states to adopt several education policy reforms that had been proven to work around the nation. Part of the package was Common Core, which, in part because of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s imprimatur, is now toxic on the right (and, because of opposition from some teachers, is just as toxic on the left).'b'Of course, despite their zeal for federalism, many conservatives never really agreed with Justice Brandeis\xe2\x80\x99s nostrum to begin with. They worry that successful state policies might not translate well to the federal level, even under ideal conditions \xe2\x80\x94 witness the 'b'skepticism'b' with which Congressional Republicans greeted President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s announcement last week of a new initiative to help students attend community college, based on a program in Tennessee.'b'And they have a point: It turns out scaling a successful state program often ends up with a one-size-fits-all policy that might work well in Ohio but fall flat in Arizona. An economic development program centered on promoting entrepreneurship might work in Silicon Valley, Boston or Austin, Tex., but fail miserably in an area without leading universities and a highly educated work force.'b'Moreover, federal mandates, in which Washington sets up rules and the states run with them, hopefully innovating along the way, have not fared much better. The Medicaid expansion was intended to be a core pillar of the Affordable Care Act, but following a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision, many states chose to opt out.'b'Finally, all politics aside, while tax revenues have been increasing recently, many states remain cash-strapped since the Great Recession, limiting their ability to initiate significant economic or social programs of any kind.'b'Taken together, these forces mean that while states might experiment with numerous policies over the coming years, very few will ever go national. For those of us frustrated with federal gridlock, the states will provide little comfort going forward. The 50 laboratories of democracy will produce many so-called cures, but none of them will go down very well in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.'b'It should come as no surprise that the very first move of the new Republican Senate is an attempt to push President Obama into approving the Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry oil from Canadian tar sands. After all, debts must be paid, and the oil and gas industry \xe2\x80\x94 which gave 87 percent of its 2014 campaign contributions to the G.O.P. \xe2\x80\x94 expects to be rewarded for its support.'b'But why is this environmentally troubling project an urgent priority in a time of plunging world oil prices? Well, the party line, from people like Mitch McConnell, the new Senate majority leader, is that it\xe2\x80\x99s all about jobs. And it\xe2\x80\x99s true: Building Keystone XL could slightly increase U.S. employment. In fact, it might replace almost 5 percent of the jobs America has lost because of destructive cuts in federal spending, which were in turn the direct result of Republican blackmail over the debt ceiling.'b'Oh, and don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me that the cases are completely different. You can\xe2\x80\x99t consistently claim that pipeline spending creates jobs while government spending doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s back up for a minute and discuss economic principles.'b'For more than seven years \xe2\x80\x94 ever since the Bush-era housing and debt bubbles burst \xe2\x80\x94 the United States economy has suffered from inadequate demand. Total spending just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been enough to fully employ the nation\xe2\x80\x99s resources. In such an environment, anything that increases spending creates jobs. And if private spending is depressed, a temporary rise in public spending can and should take its place. That\xe2\x80\x99s why a great majority of economists believe that the Obama stimulus did, in fact, reduce the unemployment rate compared with what it would have been without that stimulus.'b'From the beginning, however, Republican leaders have held the opposite view, insisting that we should slash public spending in the face of high unemployment. And they\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten their way: The years after 2010, when Republicans took control of the House, were marked by an unprecedented decline in real government spending per capita, which leveled off only in 2014.'b'The evidence overwhelmingly indicates that this kind of fiscal austerity in a depressed economy is destructive; if the economic news has been better lately, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably in part because of the fact that federal, state and local governments have finally stopped cutting. And spending cuts have, in particular, cost a lot of jobs. When the Congressional Budget Office was asked how many jobs would be lost because of the sequester \xe2\x80\x94 the big cuts in federal spending that Republicans extracted in 2011 by threatening to push America into default \xe2\x80\x94 its best estimate was 900,000. And that\xe2\x80\x99s only part of the total loss.'b'Needless to say, the guilty parties here will never admit that they were wrong. But if you look at their behavior closely, you see clear signs that they don\xe2\x80\x99t really believe in their own doctrine.'b'Consider, for example, the case of military spending. When it comes to possible cuts in defense contracts, politicians who loudly proclaim that every dollar the government spends comes at the expense of the private sector suddenly begin talking about all the jobs that will be destroyed. They even begin talking about the multiplier effect, as reduced spending by defense workers leads to job losses in other industries. This is the phenomenon former Representative Barney Frank dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cweaponized Keynesianism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And the argument being made for Keystone XL is very similar; call it \xe2\x80\x9ccarbonized Keynesianism.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, approving the pipeline would mobilize some money that would otherwise have sat idle, and in so doing create some jobs \xe2\x80\x94 42,000 during the construction phase, according to the most widely cited estimate. (Once completed, the pipeline would employ only a few dozen workers.) But government spending on roads, bridges and schools would do the same thing.'b'And the job gains from the pipeline would, as I said, be only a tiny fraction \xe2\x80\x94 less than 5 percent \xe2\x80\x94 of the job losses from sequestration, which in turn are only part of the damage done by spending cuts in general. If Mr. McConnell and company really believe that we need more spending to create jobs, why not support a push to upgrade America\xe2\x80\x99s crumbling infrastructure?'b'So what should be done about Keystone XL? If you believe that it would be environmentally damaging \xe2\x80\x94 which I do \xe2\x80\x94 then you should be against it, and you should ignore the claims about job creation. The numbers being thrown around are tiny compared with the country\xe2\x80\x99s overall work force. And in any case, the jobs argument for the pipeline is basically a sick joke coming from people who have done all they can to destroy American jobs \xe2\x80\x94 and are now employing the very arguments they used to ridicule government job programs to justify a big giveaway to their friends in the fossil fuel industry.'b'The solidarity march of more than one million people in Paris on Sunday was rich in placards and symbols but appropriately devoid of speeches. Like many in the vast throng that filled the broad boulevards between Place de la R\xc3\xa9publique and Place de la Nation, the world leaders who marched a portion of the route with President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande locked arms and embraced. But there was no podium, no pulpit, only ubiquitous signs reading \xe2\x80\x9cJe suis Charlie.\xe2\x80\x9d For the moment, that said it all.'b'Charlie, as the world has come to know, is Charlie Hebdo, the satirical weekly tabloid that was attacked by two radical Islamist gunmen on Wednesday. An apparent ally of those gunmen allegedly killed a policewoman and burst into a kosher supermarket in Paris, murdering several people there. In the end, 17 people and the three terrorists were dead, and \xe2\x80\x9cJe suis Charlie\xe2\x80\x9d swiftly became a declaration of solidarity and grief, displayed on kiosks, armbands, headbands, TV screens and banners.'b'There were some other signs, too \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI am Charlie, cop, Jew\xe2\x80\x9d read some, and many displayed a simple pencil, symbol for the freedom of expression that came under attack when the brothers Ch\xc3\xa9rif and Sa\xc3\xafd Kouachi massacred cartoonists and editors at Charlie Hebdo, evidently because the magazine had published cartoons satirizing the Prophet Muhammad.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s much that can and should be discussed as a result of the tragedy \xe2\x80\x94 about freedom of the press, about the growing backlash across Europe against Muslim immigrants, about Islamist terrorism and Islamic fundamentalism. Certainly many of the dozens of national leaders in the Paris march \xe2\x80\x94 including the leaders of Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, the Palestinian Authority and Greece \xe2\x80\x94 could have said plenty. Many of their countries have known vicious terrorist attacks in recent years; many are contending with rising anti-immigrant movements. The White House will gather leaders in Washington next month for a'b' summit meeting'b' on preventing terrorism, the American attorney general, Eric Holder Jr., announced.'b'But with the horror and fears raised by the attacks still fresh, it was important and proper that the first response in Paris \xe2\x80\x94 as elsewhere in France, across Europe and across the Atlantic \xe2\x80\x94 was a resounding and united demonstration of outrage and solidarity. Simply by turning out in vast numbers, the marchers eloquently demonstrated a shared conviction that Charlie Hebdo was exercising a right fundamental to democracy, the right of free expression. No perceived provocation, no grievance and certainly no religious conviction justifies killing those who wield only a pen.'b'The Charlie Hebdo murders are certain to intensify exploration for effective ways to combat terrorism. The probability that one of the Kouachi brothers had trained with Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and was on American watch lists should prompt a search for better cooperation and communication among Western allies and new ways to deal with the veteran jihadists who return to Europe after training and fighting with groups abroad.'b'Perhaps the greatest danger in the wake of the massacres is that more Europeans will come to the conclusion that all Muslim immigrants on the Continent are carriers of a great and mortal threat. Anti-immigrant sentiments were already at a dangerous level, making it essential for national and pan-European leaders in coming days to underscore that extremism is not inherent to the Muslim faith, and that the Islamists themselves are hardly a single entity.'b'That point was searingly made by the'b' brother of Ahmed Merabet,'b' a French police officer who was one of the people gunned down in the Charlie Hebdo attack. \xe2\x80\x9cMy brother was Muslim,\xe2\x80\x9d said Malek Merabet, \xe2\x80\x9cand he was killed by two terrorists, by two false Muslims.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan does a masterful political Jekyll and Hyde. A cable from the American ambassador to Baku released on WikiLeaks described him as a Michael Corleone-Sonny Corleone figure \xe2\x80\x94 referring, respectively, to the coolly calculating and the impetuously violent brothers of the \xe2\x80\x9cGodfather\xe2\x80\x9d mafia family. Mr. Aliyev is \xe2\x80\x9cpro-Western\xe2\x80\x9d in many of the ways the West admires: He is suave, well dressed and well spoken in English; he is ready to send his country\xe2\x80\x99s ample supplies of oil and gas to Europe and to Israel; his Islam is moderate and modern; and he hosts lavish international events like the Eurovision Song Contest in 2012 and the European Games to be held next June.'b'He is also hugely corrupt, and his authoritarian regime has one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst records on human rights.'b'Last month, continuing a crackdown on independent media and nongovernmental organizations, police officers 'b'raided'b' the offices of the United States-financed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Baku \xe2\x80\x94 known locally as Radio Azadliq \xe2\x80\x94 taking away computers and documents and sealing the premises. A dozen R.F.E./R.L. employees were detained and questioned.'b'A few weeks earlier, the government 'b'jailed'b' a well-known investigative reporter, Khadija Ismayilova, who had worked for the broadcaster and had reported on the lucrative business dealings of Mr. Aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s family. The government first tried to frighten and blackmail her, then hit her with the Orwellian charge that she had pushed a lover toward suicide. Another critic of the regime, Leyla Yunus, a prominent human rights activist, has been in jail since April along with her husband, Arif Yunus.'b'Mr. Aliyev, of course, is not the only dictator whose skillful politics and control of valuable natural resources have confronted American and European policy makers with what the cable released by WikiLeaks called \xe2\x80\x9ca choice between U.S. interests and U.S. values.\xe2\x80\x9d His father, Heydar Aliyev, ruled Azerbaijan with an iron hand from 1969 to his death in 2003, first as its Soviet boss and then as its president. The son, assisted by Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s oil wealth, has steadily built on the father\xe2\x80\x99s cult of personality through three questionable elections.'b'Yet even as Mr. Aliyev cultivates the West, he is convinced that foreign-financed organizations, including R.F.E./R.L., are out to get him. Like his partner in authoritarianism, Vladimir Putin, he sees a hostile American hand behind everything from the ouster of President Viktor Yanukovych in Ukraine to the various Arab uprisings, and he is determined to nip any such opposition in the bud. On Dec. 4, Mr. Aliyev\xe2\x80\x99s top lieutenant, Ramiz Mehdiyev, published a 60-page manifesto complaining of a \xe2\x80\x9cfifth column\xe2\x80\x9d of nongovernmental organizations plotting a revolution, and suggesting that Ms. Ismayilova was getting her information from \xe2\x80\x9cforeign spies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The West must understand that the authoritarian Mr. Aliyev is the real Mr. Aliyev. As he accelerates his campaign to crush opponents and any other semblance of freedom, the United States and Europe should make far clearer than they have that while they may be compelled to do business with him, they have no illusions about what he is and the severe damage he is doing to his country.'b'Hands down, 2014 was the best year for the labor market since the Great Recession hit in late 2007.'b'But it would be wrong to simply root for more of the same. Recent progress does not so much point a way forward as highlight weaknesses that need to be corrected and risks that need to be avoided in order not to backslide.'b'The 'b'December employment report'b', released Friday, showed that 252,000 jobs were added last month, bringing the job creation total for 2014 to nearly three million \xe2\x80\x94 well ahead of tallies from the past seven years. And yet, 'b'employment growth still lags population growth'b' by 5.6 million jobs, a gap that will take roughly two years to fill at 2014\xe2\x80\x99s average pace of monthly job creation.'b'Even more disturbing, job growth in December was heavily skewed toward low-wage work. In all, nearly a million of the jobs created in 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 a third of the total \xe2\x80\x94 were in low-wage sectors, including retail, restaurants, bars and hotels, temporary work services, home health care and nursing homes.'b'Poor job quality is one of the reasons that wage growth has been relentlessly sluggish. Last November\xe2\x80\x99s unexpectedly large wage increase was revised down in the December report, which also showed average hourly wages declining last month by 5 cents. Over all, wages rose a mere 1.7 percent in 2014, barely outpacing inflation.'b'Clearly then, the economy needs faster job growth, better jobs and higher pay. But how? President Obama will lay out economic policy prescriptions in his State of the Union speech later this month, and Republican leaders will have their own ideas, which will, one hopes, go beyond saying no to Mr. Obama and calling for tax cuts.'b'Still, given longstanding partisan divisions, what politicians don\xe2\x80\x99t do may prove to be more important than what they do. The new Republican majority in Congress, for instance, has to avoid the temptation to turn basic acts of governance \xe2\x80\x94 replenishing the Highway Trust Fund (before its depletion in May), raising the federal debt limit (probably in late summer) and passing a budget (next fall) \xe2\x80\x94 into serial fiscal crises. As the economist 'b'Jared Bernstein recently noted'b', a big reason the labor market improved last year is that the fiscal austerity and budget battles that hurt growth in 2013 no longer exerted a drag on growth in 2014.'b'The Federal Reserve can help the labor market by delaying any interest rate increase until clear signs of inflationary pressure emerge in wages and prices. For now, the Fed is projecting steadily higher inflation as the labor market improves and oil prices rise, a scenario that suggests rate increases sooner rather than later. But the Fed could be wrong. The labor market could remain stuck in a low-wage rut while the effects of low oil prices \xe2\x80\x94 including a stronger dollar and global economic weakness \xe2\x80\x94 dent what growth there has been in manufacturing and other higher-paying sectors. A premature rate hike would make that bad situation much worse.'b'It would be great to bolster low-wage jobs with a higher federal minimum wage in 2015 and to foster middle-class jobs with robust infrastructure spending, increased support for public employment and enhanced protections for collective bargaining. At the very least, however, it is imperative not to undo the progress to date with reactionary politics and erroneous policy.'b'An 'b'extended video'b' released last week of the shooting death of Tamir Rice in Cleveland appears to show an unconscionable level of human depravity on the part of the officer who shot him, a stunning disregard for the value of his life and a callousness toward the people who loved him.'b'His black life didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to matter. But it does.'b'On Nov. 22, two officers responded to a 911 call about a \xe2\x80\x9cguy\xe2\x80\x9d in a park pointing a gun that was \xe2\x80\x9cprobably fake.\xe2\x80\x9d (By the way, 'b'Ohio is an open-carry state'b', so having and carrying a gun is not a crime in and of itself.)'b'The guy was Tamir. He had a pellet gun. There is 'b'no indication in police statements'b' that he ever fired it.'b'One of the officers, Timothy Loehmann, shot Tamir within \xe2\x80\x9c1.5 to two seconds\xe2\x80\x9d of arriving at the park. Two seconds. So quickly. In the blink of an eye. And yet, 'b'according to The Associated Press'b', the officers say that they ordered Tamir to put his hands up three times before he was shot. According to the 'b'original statement released by the police'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThe suspect did not comply with the officers\xe2\x80\x99 orders and reached to his waistband for the gun.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All in one and a half to two seconds? Really. Take a moment and time yourself giving three commands, imagining a response from Tamir and making the decision to shoot. Maybe it can be done in less than two seconds. But to my mind, it strains credulity.'b'When one of the officers called in the shooting, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cShots fired, male down, black male, maybe 20.\xe2\x80\x9d Tamir was 12.'b'Tamir\xe2\x80\x99s 14-year-old sister, 'b'Tajai'b', was in a nearby recreation center when she said she heard a gunshot. She said someone told her that a boy had been shot \xe2\x80\x94 her own brother.'b'She raced to his aid, but as the video shows, one of the officers tackled her, handcuffed her and stuffed her into the back of the police cruiser, just feet away from where her brother was bleeding out onto the snow-dappled ground.'b'She could not reach him. Her arms could not cradle his body and plead for him to hang on. Her hands could not stroke his cheek, and she could not whisper hopefully, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to be O.K.\xe2\x80\x9d Her eyes could not gaze into his and say what sisters are able to say without saying anything: \xe2\x80\x9cI love you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tamir deserved that, but the officers made sure that she could not provide it. Four minutes passed without anyone offering the boy aid or comfort. Four long minutes he lay there, still alive, with the burn of a bullet in his abdomen.'b'How excruciating must the pain have been? How slowly must the time have passed? How great must his fear and sadness have been? What must Tamir have thought as the officers hovered about, not helping him?'b'Hopefully, events to the contrary, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think that his life didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. It did and it does.'b'Tamir died from his wound the next day.'b'It is hard to think of the gravely injured boy and the aloof officers who\xe2\x80\x99d done the deed but withheld their help, and not reach a white-hot level of righteous indignation.'b'Tamir was a human being, a child \xe2\x80\x94 who could have been any of our children, and who was robbed of his life and therefore his future. Twelve years old. That\xe2\x80\x99s just a baby, a baby with a hole in his belly. This wrong must be made right.'b'There is a basic respect for life that should have governed that day, and which seems, in the video, shockingly absent from it.'b'Not only is the shooting itself disturbing, but the failure to render aid is unconscionable. And this didn\xe2\x80\x99t just happen in Tamir\xe2\x80\x99s case. The same apathy about the immediate administration of care is echoed in other cases where black boys and men lay dying.'b'After 'b'George Zimmerman shot Trayvon Martin'b', Zimmerman mounted the boy and stretched his arms wide. Martin was still alive.'b'(By the way, Zimmerman was arrested 'b'yet again'b' Saturday, this time on charges of aggravated assault and domestic violence with a weapon for allegedly throwing a wine bottle at his girlfriend. \xe2\x80\x9cGeorgie\xe2\x80\x9d doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem so peaceful anymore, does he?)'b'After officers choked Eric Garner until he fell unconscious, 'b'no one administered CPR'b'. Instead they checked his pockets. Garner was still alive.'b'As 'b'Salon put it'b', after Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown through the head, Wilson didn\xe2\x80\x99t check to see if Brown \xe2\x80\x9cwas breathing or if he had a pulse; nor did he render aid in any way, shape or form.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The list goes on, quite literally, ad nauseam.'b'The plaintive voices of the dead call the living to action. So, in the demand for justice, timorousness must be the enemy, tirelessness must be the motto and righteousness must be the compass.'b'The world must be made to acknowledge that Tamir Rice\xe2\x80\x99s life mattered.'b'NEW HAVEN \xe2\x80\x94 ONE of my elderly patients has Type 2 diabetes and heart disease. He takes a number of medications, including insulin to control his blood sugar levels. A few years ago, he was driving when his blood sugar suddenly dropped. He felt lightheaded for a moment, and then ran into a tree.'b'There are roughly 11 million Americans over age 65 with diabetes. Most of them take medications to reduce their blood sugar levels. The majority reach an average blood sugar target, or \xe2\x80\x9chemoglobin A1C,\xe2\x80\x9d of less than 7 percent. Why? Early studies showed that this can reduce the risk of diabetes complications, including eye, kidney and nerve problems. As a result, for more than a decade, medical societies, pharmaceutical companies and diabetes groups have campaigned with a simple, concrete message \xe2\x80\x94 to get below seven. Many patients carry report cards with their scores to clinic appointments. Doctors are often rewarded based on how many of their patients hit the target.'b'All of this sounds great. But, at least for older people, there are serious problems with the below-seven paradigm.'b'To begin with, the health benefits of this strategy are uncertain for older people. Those early studies that were the rationale for going below seven were conducted in people with Type 1 diabetes or with younger patients with newly diagnosed Type 2 diabetes. Subsequent trials of older patients raised doubts about the benefits.'b'Worse, targeting low blood sugar levels can cause harm. In one instance, investigators actually had to stop a trial early because patients who were targeting hemoglobin A1C levels of six or below had significantly higher rates of death than patients targeting levels in the sevens. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly why this happened. What we do know is that aiming for levels below seven increases the risk for \xe2\x80\x9chypoglycemia,\xe2\x80\x9d or low blood sugar reactions. Severe reactions can result in confusion, coma, falls, fractures, abnormal heart rhythms and even death.'b'Older people are especially susceptible to severe hypoglycemia. With age, kidneys become less efficient, which causes insulin (or other drugs) to accumulate in the body; this, in turn, can lead to hypoglycemia. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, older people often take multiple medications, some of which may interact with diabetes drugs. This, too, may cause hypoglycemia. Using multiple medications or complex insulin regimens also increases the chances of errors, such as taking the wrong dose or the wrong type of insulin. Finally, older people have fewer warning symptoms when they experience mild dips in blood sugar, and this leaves less time for them to react and treat the problem before it becomes severe. This is precisely what happened to my patient.'b'Given the questionable benefits and the very real risks of going below seven, the American Geriatrics Society and the Veterans Affairs diabetes guidelines have, for years, recommended a cautious, case-by-case approach for older patients. For those with serious health problems, or prior history of hypoglycemia, going below seven may not be worth the risks involved. The problem is that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t put these guidelines into practice.'b'In a 'b'new study'b' published today in JAMA Internal Medicine, my colleagues and I used nationally representative data from 2001 to 2010 and showed that 62 percent of adults over age 65 went below seven. But here\xe2\x80\x99s the catch. We found absolutely no difference in how people were treated based on their health. In other words, patients in poor health and at risk for hypoglycemia tended to be treated as aggressively as far healthier patients. This seems to confirm that we have been adhering to a one-size-fits-all approach, despite the risks that it poses to millions of older Americans.'b'Part of the problem is that there are strong incentives in place to keep the status quo. The diabetes drug industry has a vested interest in selling its products to as many Americans as it can, and has been incredibly successful at doing so. Sales of diabetes drugs in 2013 were about equal to the combined revenue of the National Football League, Major League Baseball and the National Basketball Association. There is nothing wrong with the industry selling its drugs, but it is the job of the medical profession to guide what treatment patients receive. To do this properly, doctors with financial ties to diabetes drug industry shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be writing guidelines on how to use these drugs. At present, this is still common.'b'Ultimately, changing current paradigms requires that doctors partner with their patients in making decisions about treatment. Patients need to understand that there are different options, with different risks. The goal is not to get a perfect score on a report card, but to weigh these risks to make a good decision.'b'My patient was terrified at the prospect of having another car wreck \xe2\x80\x94 a completely reasonable concern \xe2\x80\x94 and we decided to use less insulin and let his sugars run higher, in the eights. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible this slightly raises his risk of kidney or eye problems. But this was a risk that he was more than happy to take.'b'LAGOS, Nigeria \xe2\x80\x94  My compatriots moan ceaselessly about wicked politicians who pocket the wealth from our nation\xe2\x80\x99s natural resources with impunity, yet most are reluctant to do anything about it. This is not surprising \xe2\x80\x94 there are inherent risks in challenging authority, especially in a country like Nigeria, where, in the words of former President Olusegun Obasanjo, politics is a \xe2\x80\x9cdo or die affair.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet, in a land where most people go along to get along, Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s writers and performers have always been a feisty lot. For the generation that came of age at independence in 1960, art and politics mixed with a general optimism about the country\xe2\x80\x99s future. And as the last decades of the last century unfolded amid greed, corruption and state-sponsored violence, they took it upon themselves to become the voice of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s conscience.'b'The work of a new generation of Nigerian writers, by comparison, has grown inward-looking and politically remote, the inversion of the Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka\xe2\x80\x99s much-quoted admonition, \xe2\x80\x9cThe man dies in all who keep silent in the face of tyranny.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s not that the writers of today are afraid to address the problems that plague our country \xe2\x80\x94 they do so with eloquence and compassion. But there is more gloom than hope in their writing. Their work is weighed down by a despair that stems from the fact that the people most in need of reading what they have to say are paying little or no attention.'b'This was not the case during the first decades of independence. Ken Saro-Wiwa\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for the rights of the much-abused Ogoni people in the oil-rich Niger delta drew worldwide attention. His organization, the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People, became one of the largest in Nigeria. His artistic and political reputation spread far beyond his homeland, especially after Gen. Sani Abacha\xe2\x80\x99s military government had him tried on trumped-up charges and executed in 1995. Amid the international outrage that followed, human rights activists brought a lawsuit against the Shell oil company, and Nigeria was suspended from the Commonwealth of Nations for more than three years.'b'The reputation of Nigerian writers remains broad, but it is not deep. Wole Soyinka\xe2\x80\x99s poems and plays earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1986; novels like Saro-Wiwa\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSozaboy\xe2\x80\x9d (about a young soldier caught up in the civil war), or Chinua Achebe\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThings Fall Apart\xe2\x80\x9d (which traces the cultural destruction of a village at the hands of well-meaning missionaries) are honored the world over; Fela Anikulapo Kuti, the musician who pioneered Afrobeat with songs of protest and rebellion, was the subject of a popular Broadway musical.'b'But Broadway is a long way from  Lagos, and, high-minded as they might be, the opinions of the Nobel committee have little to do with the price of oil in Abuja. Our writers are celebrated overseas, but that\xe2\x80\x99s because they write in English, only one of the 500 or more languages and dialects used by the country\xe2\x80\x99s 250 ethnic groups. In any case, many Nigerians can\xe2\x80\x99t read.'b'One may wonder why a government that draws much of its popular support by putting people on the payroll has never created a censorship bureau for printed material (there is a film censorship board). In fact, there is no need. Saro-Wiwa was hanged for his activism, not his literary work; Wole Soyinka, accused of supporting the Igbo people, spent two years in prison during the murderous Biafran war. In his memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man Died,\xe2\x80\x9d he saw with uncanny accuracy that postwar Nigeria would be governed \xe2\x80\x9cby a new military ethic \xe2\x80\x94 coercion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No Nigerian artist in any genre has been more scathing about the country\xe2\x80\x99s colossal failure of leadership than Fela Kuti, who died in 1997 at the age of 58 but whose ironic, mournful music plays nonstop in dance halls, bars and cafes across the country. In songs like \xe2\x80\x9cShuffering and Shmiling,\xe2\x80\x9d he describes the lot of the great mass of Nigerians who live without running water or regular power as they struggle to get through the workaday world. In \xe2\x80\x9cOpen and Close,\xe2\x80\x9d he berates his compatriots for allowing themselves to be abused. In \xe2\x80\x9cArmy Arrangeement\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x94 a play on a pidgin word \xe2\x80\x94 he rails against the underhanded dealing of politicians, bureaucrats and businesspeople.'b'And yet what irked the authorities even more than his politics was his lifestyle \xe2\x80\x94 smoking marijuana during live performances, wandering about in public in his underwear, living openly with his 27 wives. In all of this he seemed to challenge the illusion of order in a country that began falling apart even as it was gaining its independence.'b'Despite the outspokenness of these men, they seem to have had little domestic influence on a population that is still largely rural and woefully under-educated. A new generation of writers, singers and stand-up comics may draw urbane audiences. But to the politicians gearing up for elections next month, what the artistic community says about them remains of little consequence.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never voted in Nigerian elections and I won\xe2\x80\x99t again this year,\xe2\x80\x9d A. Igoni Barrett, the short story writer, told me recently: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m less an apathetic voter than a thoroughly disillusioned citizen.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another writer, Eghosa Imasuen, admits readily enough to disillusion but finds himself struggling against apathy.'b'Comments like these raise age-old questions of artistic integrity and the writer\xe2\x80\x99s duty to confront tyranny and injustice. Soyinka, Saro-Wiwa and others of their generation did not hesitate to do so. But things are different today. The climate has changed. Three decades of military dictatorship have given way to a listless democracy, where corruption rules, apathy spreads and a dangerous vacuum is filled with the likes of the murderous Boko Haram insurgency.'b'No amount of noise making from the chattering classes seems to reach our politicians, and that is exactly what makes our predicament so dangerous. If our leaders refuse to listen when our artists speak of ennui, anger and despair, they set themselves up for the fate that befalls all rulers who remain deaf to simmering discontent. We must break out of this national lassitude before it\xe2\x80\x99s too late.'b''b'\n'b'Adewale Maja-Pearce'b' is a writer and critic, and the author, most recently, of the memoir \xe2\x80\x9cThe House My Father Built.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'HAMBURG, Germany \xe2\x80\x94 Another Chapter 11 for Greece, the third in five years \xe2\x80\x94 and no exit in sight.

Never mind that they should never have been accepted in the first place, when they cooked the books to look prim and proper.'b'Not even Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the radical leftist Syriza party, wants out. Apparently on track to win the snap elections on Jan. 25, 'b'he has vowed'b': \xe2\x80\x9cWe will stick with the euro, no doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nor does anybody else \xe2\x80\x94 including Germany \xe2\x80\x94 want Greece to leave, if truth be told, even though the German leader, Angela Merkel, now has her minions spreading the word that a \xe2\x80\x9cGrexit\xe2\x80\x9d is no longer an absolute no-no. If Mr. Tsipras wins and then imposes another haircut on the country\xe2\x80\x99s creditors while nixing market reforms and fiscal rigor, then it will be auf Wiedersehen to Hellas. So goes the unspoken \xe2\x80\x94 but ultimately hollow \xe2\x80\x94 threat from Berlin.'b'In the meantime, Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman has 'b'volubly denied that threats'b', even implicit ones, were made. Nonetheless, the euro crisis is back to where it started five years ago: in Greece. Is it another rising tide that will recede, as in years past, or a deadly tsunami that will drown first Greece and then the eurozone?'b'Unless you overbought now-melting Greek bonds, sit back and enjoy the theater with its two starring antagonists, the chancellor of Germany and the would-be prime minister of Greece. Ms. Merkel, as is her habit, deploys innuendo and leaks. Mr. Tsipras flings wild-eyed threats. He wants to \xe2\x80\x9ctear up\xe2\x80\x9d austerity pledges and stop servicing Greek debt, invoking the metaphor of the Cold War\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear standoffs: \xe2\x80\x9cIf one side pushes the red button, then all will lose.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the core of the crisis: a monetary game of chicken. As we know from war gaming, the party that appears to be crazier than the rest tends to score. Strategists call this the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'rationality of irrationality'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Foam at the mouth, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll get your way more easily than meekly asking for another 100 billion euros.'b'Crazy the game is not. The Greeks have been saved twice: in 2010, 'b'with 110 billion euros'b' ($147 billion), and in 2012, 'b'with 130 billion euros'b' ($173 billion). In 2011, private investors had to take a 'b'50 percent write-down'b' on their holdings of Greek government debt. These bailouts have created their own expectations in Greece.'b'Monetary war is a bit like nuclear war in this respect: Everyone knows how to start one, but nobody knows how it will end. A Grexit might get rid of a noisome neighbor, but it might also bring down the whole house of the euro.'b'In their more sober moments, Greek politicians might play a friendlier game. They could trot out what they have already achieved. Growth, which just three years ago was in negative territory, with the Greek economy 'b'shrinking about 7 percent a year'b', is now not much worse than Germany\xe2\x80\x99s. Unemployment \xe2\x80\x94 'b'still a whopping 25 percent'b' \xe2\x80\x94 is falling, though ever so slightly.'b'Unfortunately, there is a darker side. Austerity measures inflicted by the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund have not been quite as cruel as Athens keeps claiming. The debt of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s central government has almost doubled since 2011, and gross external debt has since risen from 'b'370 billion euros to 412 billion'b' over the same period. So Greece is still living beyond its means.'b'Hence crisis No.3. Athens\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to foreign lenders is rising once more. In everyday language, the Greeks cannot get their act together. Worse, if Mr. Tsipras does win a parliamentary majority at the end of the month, he has pledged to unleash a wave of public spending to reward his supporters.'b'Strangely, this gambit is not irrational brinkmanship. If Syriza does come to power (though at the moment its lead is shrinking), the new government will yield here and there to make nice with Ms. Merkel. But any government, left-wing or centrist, knows one big thing: Greece has a history of bailouts on its side. That will dampen the passions of ardent reformists.'b'By contrast, the German leader does not have Europe on her side. France and Italy, just to name the big two, have been trying to get out from under the chancellor\xe2\x80\x99s whip for years. Unable, like Greece, to bring forward labor market reforms and economic liberalization, Paris and Rome are clamoring for an end to fiscal discipline, which would allow them to allocate their (or their creditors\xe2\x80\x99) money to lavish deficit spending. The Mediterranean mood is working for Athens.'b'Also, with its tiny economy, Greece can and will be saved, again. It is too small to fail, so to speak. But together, France and Italy represent Europe\xe2\x80\x99s hard-core problem, which is economic stagnation over time \xe2\x80\x94 despite a long history of deficit spending.'b'Forget the Grexit issue: It\xe2\x80\x99s Europe\xe2\x80\x99s historical trends that should worry us. In the decades since the economic miracle days of the \xe2\x80\x9970s, real growth in the European Union has dropped on average by three-quarters of a percentage point. Productivity growth has likewise slid, to 0.4 percent from about 2 percent per year. These ailments are deeply embedded in economies that lag behind on investment, innovation and competitiveness.'b'Greece\xe2\x80\x99s problems are peanuts, relatively speaking. But Europe as a whole is beginning to look like Greece writ large. This magnificent continent has invented everything from the Renaissance to the MP3 player. Unlike Greece, the European Union is enormously rich \xe2\x80\x94 its G.D.P. is actually a little larger than the United States\xe2\x80\x99.

National security spending as well outpaces federal spending on the most needy.'b'Yes, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness of tax expenditures and military programs, but it is not impossible.

But as last July\xe2\x80\x99s fatal police assault on Eric Garner showed, reality is messier than the rule book \xe2\x80\x94 and more dangerous for civilians.'b'A 'b'new report'b' from the department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general, released Monday, suggests that this much-reviled, supposedly disavowed tactic has never gone away; that officers sometimes use it as a first, not last, resort against those who verbally resist them; and that systems set up to investigate and punish those who abuse their power are unreliable and ineffective.'b'For a citizenry that rightly demands professionalism and accountability from its armed officers, this is not reassuring.'b'The report reviewed 10 cases between 2009 and June 2014 in which the Civilian Complaint Review Board substantiated accusations of officers\xe2\x80\x99 using chokeholds (though not the Garner killing). In nine of the cases, the review board recommended the most severe level of department discipline, called administrative charges, for the accused officers.'b'But for all its efforts, the Civilian Complaint Review Board \xe2\x80\x94 a supposedly important layer of outsider oversight to protect the public from the police \xe2\x80\x94 might as well have been reporting to a brick wall. The report found that the Department Advocate\xe2\x80\x99s Office, which until April 2013 was responsible for handling disciplinary cases involving the use of force, and the police commissioner at the time, Raymond Kelly, who had the ultimate authority over police punishment, had repeatedly rejected the board\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and decided to impose lesser penalties or none at all.'b'The inspector general, Philip Eure, took pains to explain that the report was not comprehensive, just a beginning look at issues that may need improvement. But some problems seem obvious. The commissioner shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be able simply to brush away findings and recommendations from the Civilian Complaint Review Board \xe2\x80\x94 as Mr. Kelly did \xe2\x80\x94 without explanation. The public should see the reasons, in writing, when chokeholders are let off the hook. The department also needs to improve and reinforce its training right now, so that officers never respond to verbal provocations by immediately lunging for the neck.'b'When the City Council created the police inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office in 2013, critics deplored the move as another needless layer of meddling. But anything that adds clarity to the opaque and seemingly arbitrary process of police discipline is a welcome improvement.'b'Mr. Eure promises to follow up with a deeper examination of concerns involving the use of force.

But no matter how categorically they reject terrorism committed in the name of Islam, many French citizens still view them with suspicion, not entirely unjustly. For decades, Islamists have been hard at work in prisons, industrial suburbs and neighborhood mosques, peddling a strong religious identity and hope for the future to disaffected young people.'b'Islam has become more than a religion: To many French youths of immigrant origin, it now provides a culture that 'b'France'b' itself has not managed to instill. For some, a desire for life has been replaced by a desire for death: the death of others, of infidels, and one\xe2\x80\x99s own death as a martyr bound for paradise. That is how Al Qaeda and now the Islamic State have recruited volunteers to train in Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan or Libya.'b'The French government has not paid serious and sustained attention to the situation in its often dreary suburbs, a neglected zone where unsocialized youths live \xe2\x80\x94 or merely survive. Islamist recruiters target this empty space, abandoned by the state. The increasingly racist language of the right-wing National Front, and a 'b'current of intellectual discourse'b' that accuses immigrants and their children of blurring France\xe2\x80\x99s national persona, have fostered resentment among young people whose Frenchness is always questioned, and never taken for granted.'b'The novelist Michel Houellebecq\xe2\x80\x99s latest book, \xe2\x80\x9cSubmission,\xe2\x80\x9d imagines a France governed in 2022 by a Muslim president who sends women back into the home and legalizes polygamy. A recent polemic, \xe2\x80\x9cThe French Suicide,\xe2\x80\x9d by the journalist \xc3\x89ric Zemmour, ascribes the decline of France to the pernicious influence of the student uprisings in May 1968, immigration, 'b'same-sex marriage'b' and feminism: ultraconservative and reactionary ideas that have made this book a huge best seller and that resemble those of the National Front (albeit unintentionally, according to Mr. Zemmour).'b'France has been bruised, traumatized, left reeling. The French are frightened \xe2\x80\x94 or more precisely, they are being frightened. The National Front has made fear its credo. It demonizes millions of immigrants as invaders who feast on welfare benefits while putting others out of work. Of course, this reasoning doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold up. As economists have pointed out, nations in the West ought to be 'b'more worried about their aging populations'b' than about their immigrants. If a magic wand were to send all of France\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim immigrants back where they came from, the nation would come to a halt economically.'b'France is thus torn between an ever-more-powerful extreme right (polls suggest that the National Front\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Marine Le Pen, could prevail \xe2\x80\x94 if not outright, then in a runoff \xe2\x80\x94 in the 2017 presidential election) and its liberal traditions of asylum. The right wing demands closing borders and pulling back, while the left wing is determined to remain true to its humanist principles.'b'Changing the daily lives of French Muslims demands a new political vision, a real determination to confront the problems of the troubled suburbs, and an acknowledgment of the identity of French youths, who have been left to fend for themselves, victims of racism whenever they look for work or go out for an evening of fun. The authorities must deal with the recruiting activities of extremist imams and monitor their speeches. They have their work cut out for them in the prisons as well, now ideal venues for indoctrination that generates fodder for jihad. And lastly, a great effort must be made in the schools, where textbooks should be revised to reflect the diversity of French tradition, and new courses offered on racism and on the history of religions.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also up to Muslims to get organized and see to the education of adolescents \xe2\x80\x94 too many of whom are left to drift on their own and into the net of political Islamism, easy prey for jihadist recruiters. Some imams have promised to undertake this salvage operation, but it is a daunting task: In certain schools in the department of Seine-Saint-Denis, for example, some students of immigrant origin refused to observe a 'b'minute of silence'b' last Thursday to honor the victims of the terrorist massacre.'b'However, the millions of people who marched in cities across France on Sunday, in a peaceful show of solidarity, are cause for hope. The false amalgam of Islam and murderous Islamism is coming apart. The great numbers of Muslim men and women in these demonstrations, carrying signs announcing \xe2\x80\x9cI am a Muslim, I am a Jew, I am Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d have been widely noted.'b'The tragedy in France has had an astounding effect throughout the world.

'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'According to David Brooks, peacefully and nonviolently urging others to deny someone a platform to which she is not entitled to broadcast her views (but not to prevent her from saying what she wants to say) and killing people to prevent their saying what they say is merely a difference of degree and not a difference in kind. That\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.'b'Denying someone such a platform is clearly morally permissible, but killing people to prevent them from speaking is a moral monstrosity.'b'PETER A. GRAHAM'b'\nBrooklyn, Jan. 10, 2015'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'The writer is an associate philosophy professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'David Brooks is confused about the legal right to free speech. If a university committed to respecting all religions and creeds chooses to disinvite a Nazi or other far-right speaker, that has nothing to do with the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s right to free speech. He can go elsewhere to speak. The same is true for students picketing such a speaker.'b'Where is it written that a university or a group of students is obligated to hear racist rants? No one\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of speech is violated if some choose not to listen.'b'MARVIN MANDELL'b'\nWest Roxbury, Mass., Jan. 9, 2015'b''b'Maybe you\xe2\x80\x99re familiar with Ursula Le Guin\xe2\x80\x99s short story, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s about a sweet and peaceful city with lovely parks and delightful music.'b'The people in the city are genuinely happy. They enjoy their handsome buildings and a \xe2\x80\x9cmagnificent\xe2\x80\x9d farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market.'b'Le Guin describes a festival day with delicious beer and horse races: \xe2\x80\x9cAn old woman, small, fat, and laughing, is passing out flowers from a basket, and tall young men wear her flowers in their shining hair. A child of nine or ten sits at the edge of the crowd, alone, playing on a wooden flute.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is an idyllic, magical place.'b'But then Le Guin describes one more feature of Omelas. In the basement of one of the buildings, there is a small broom-closet-sized room with a locked door and no windows. A small child is locked inside the room. It looks about 6, but, actually, the child is nearly 10. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is feebleminded. Perhaps it was born defective, or perhaps it has become imbecile through fear, malnutrition and neglect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Occasionally, the door opens and people look in. The child used to cry out, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease let me out. I will be good!\xe2\x80\x9d But the people never answered and now the child just whimpers. It is terribly thin, lives on a half-bowl of cornmeal a day and must sit in its own excrement.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey all know it is there, all the people of Omelas,\xe2\x80\x9d Le Guin writes. \xe2\x80\x9cSome of them have come to see it; others are content merely to know it is there. They all know it has to be there. Some of them understand why, and some do not, but they all understand that their happiness, the beauty of their city, the tenderness of their friendships, the health of their children ... depend wholly on this child\xe2\x80\x99s abominable misery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the social contract in Omelas. One child suffers horribly so that the rest can be happy. If the child were let free or comforted, Omelas would be destroyed. Most people feel horrible for the child, and some parents hold their kids tighter, and then they return to their happiness.'b'But some go to see the child in the room and then keep walking. They don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be part of that social contract. \xe2\x80\x9cThey leave Omelas; they walk ahead into the darkness and they do not come back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In one reading this is a parable about exploitation. According to this reading, many of us live in societies whose prosperity depends on some faraway child in the basement. When we buy a cellphone or a piece of cheap clothing, there is some exploited worker \xe2\x80\x94 a child in the basement. We tolerate exploitation, telling each other that their misery is necessary for overall affluence, though maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s not.'b'In another reading, the story is a challenge to the utilitarian mind-set so prevalent today.'b'In theory, most of us subscribe to a set of values based on the idea that a human being is an end not a means. You can\xe2\x80\x99t justifiably use a human being as an object. It is wrong to enslave a person, even if that slavery might produce a large good. It is wrong to kill a person for his organs, even if many lives might be saved.'b'And yet we don\xe2\x80\x99t actually live according to that moral imperative. Life is filled with tragic trade-offs. In many different venues, the suffering of the few is justified by those trying to deliver the greatest good for the greatest number.'b'Companies succeed because they fire people, even if a whole family depends on them. Schools become prestigious because they reject people \xe2\x80\x94 even if they put a lifetime of work into their application. Leaders fighting a war on terror accidentally kill innocents. These are children in the basement of our survival and happiness.'b'The story compels readers to ask if they are willing to live according to those contracts. Some are not. They walk away from prosperity, and they make some radical commitment. They would rather work toward some inner purity.'b'The rest of us live with the trade-offs. The story reminds us of the inner numbing this creates. The people who stay in Omelas aren\xe2\x80\x99t bad; they just find it easier and easier to live with the misery they depend upon. I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that this story rivets people because it confronts them with all the tragic compromises built into modern life \xe2\x80\x94 all the children in the basements \xe2\x80\x94 and, at the same time, it elicits some desire to struggle against bland acceptance of it all.'b'In another reading, the whole city of Omelas is just different pieces of one person\xe2\x80\x99s psychology, a person living in the busy modern world, and that person\xe2\x80\x99s idealism and moral sensitivity is the shriveling child locked in the basement.'b'Writing this column on Monday afternoon, I can only guess at the final score of the big game between Ohio State and Oregon. But I certainly know who the winners are in this first ever \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d national championship college football game.'b'ESPN, which bought the rights to the four-team 'b'College Football Playoff'b' ($7.3 billion for 12 years) is a winner. The two bowl games in the first round of the playoffs, which were played on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, were the two highest-rated shows in the history of cable television. For Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s championship game, ESPN charged $1 million for a 30-second ad.'b'The five \xe2\x80\x9cpower conferences\xe2\x80\x9d are winners. For years, they resisted a playoff system, partly because they feared it would lessen the importance of the regular season. It is already obvious that the College Football Playoff has 'b'made this season more exciting'b' and \xe2\x80\x94 to sweeten the deal \xe2\x80\x94 far more lucrative, netting each conference some $50 million a year.'b'The coaches for the two teams are winners: Oregon\xe2\x80\x99s Mark Helfrich, who makes $2 million a year, plus up to $1.1 million in bonuses, will get an extra $250,000 if his Ducks win. Ohio State\xe2\x80\x99s Urban Meyer, who makes $4.5 million a year, got a big bonus just for making the four-team playoff. Phil Knight, the co-founder of Nike, is a winner. Both Ohio State and Oregon wear Nike gear. Plus, Knight has spent more than $300 million over the years ensuring that his beloved Ducks \xe2\x80\x94 he\xe2\x80\x99s an Oregon native \xe2\x80\x94 'b'have the best of everything'b'. The game Monday night was his reward.'b'In the long march to maximize revenue in college sports, there has never been an event quite so nakedly about money as the College Football Playoff. Even the March Madness basketball championship tournament, which nets the N.C.A.A. around $800 million annually, has a certain charm that arises from those inevitable, and wonderful, early-round upsets.'b'On media day \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the College Football Playoff held a media day, just like the pros do in advance of the Super Bowl \xe2\x80\x94 several players noted all the money swirling around them, and wondered why they weren\xe2\x80\x99t getting any of it. Bill Plaschke, the longtime sports columnist for The Los Angeles Times, wrote afterward that the playoff system had changed his view that a college education was reward enough for college athletes. 'b'He described media day'b' as \xe2\x80\x9cthe day college football officially turned pro,\xe2\x80\x9d and he added that it \xe2\x80\x9ctruly seems ridiculous that the players are not sharing even a small piece of this value they create.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Paradoxically, this emphasis on money-above-all-else, while creating unimaginable riches for the people who administer college sports, has also created a sense of crisis. Idealistic reformers are calling for universities to re-emphasize education. These reformers appear to have the ear of the White House. (Arne Duncan, the secretary of education, who played basketball at Harvard, is allied with this group.) There is talk of a presidential commission on college sports.'b'Meanwhile, 'b'USA Today reports that'b' the conference commissioners, and other members of the college sports industrial complex, have formed a group called the Coalition to Save College Sports. Its goal is to get out the message that college athletes already have a good deal \xe2\x80\x94 without compensation. \xe2\x80\x9cThanks to the way college sports are run,\xe2\x80\x9d their leaders wrote in an email, \xe2\x80\x9cstudent-athletes gain an education, learn skills, and have opportunities in life.\xe2\x80\x9d In other words, now that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten ours, we want to make sure the players don\xe2\x80\x99t get theirs.'b'The central conundrum is that universities are simply not built to run a multibillion-dollar entertainment industry. The only way they can do it is by looking the other way at certain practices, and making allowances for good athletes who don\xe2\x80\x99t care much about college itself. One of the reasons I advocate paying football and men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball players is that it would at least ensure that they got something for their efforts.'b'The starting quarterback for Ohio State in Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s championship game was Cardale Jones. He would seem to be exactly the kind of athlete that the college sports industrial complex points to when it talks about how a college scholarship can help a \xe2\x80\x9cstudent athlete\xe2\x80\x9d better his life.'b'Cardale, a sophomore at Ohio State, grew up in a rough neighborhood in Cleveland, the youngest of six children raised by a single mother. Until recently, he was the team\xe2\x80\x99s third-string quarterback; indeed, the only reason he was starting the game was because the two quarterbacks in front of him were hurt. Unlikely to have a pro career, you\xe2\x80\x99d think he would embrace the opportunity to get a free education.'b'Yet a few years ago, Jones tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we have to go to class if we came here to play FOOTBALL, we ain\xe2\x80\x99t come to play SCHOOL classes are POINTLESS.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the circle that can\xe2\x80\x99t be squared, no matter how many presidential commissions \xe2\x80\x94 or coalitions to save college sports \xe2\x80\x94 try.'b'Until last week, Kelvin Cochran was the chief of the Atlanta fire department, where he oversaw a work force of more than 1,000 firefighters and staff.'b'Mr. Cochran, a veteran firefighter, is also a deeply religious man, and he was eager to bring his Christian faith into the daily functioning of his department \xe2\x80\x94 or, as he put it in a book he authored in 2013, to \xe2\x80\x9ccultivate its culture to the glory of God.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But, as the book revealed, his religious beliefs also include virulent anti-gay views. He was 'b'fired'b' on Jan. 6 by Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Kasim Reed, for homophobic language in the book, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho Told You That You Were Naked?\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Among other things, he called homosexuality a \xe2\x80\x9cperversion,\xe2\x80\x9d compared it to bestiality and pedophilia, and said homosexual acts are \xe2\x80\x9cvile, vulgar and inappropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Cochran had already been suspended for a month in November for distributing the book to staff members. Following an internal investigation, the mayor did the right thing and dismissed Mr. Cochran for what he called poor judgment: specifically, for failing to get approval for the book\xe2\x80\x99s publication, for commenting publicly on his suspension after being told not to, and for exposing the city to possible discrimination lawsuits.'b'Cue up the 'b'outraged'b' 'b'claims'b' that Mr. Cochran\xe2\x80\x99s rights to free speech and religious freedom have been violated \xe2\x80\x94 an assertion that is as wrong as it was predictable.'b'Mr. Cochran said he was fired \xe2\x80\x9cfor no reason other than my Christian faith.\xe2\x80\x9d But he and his sudden coterie of supporters have it backward. This case is not about free speech or religious freedom. It is, as Mr. Reed 'b'said'b' at a news conference, about \xe2\x80\x9cmaking sure that we have an environment in government where everyone, no matter who they love, can come to work from 8 to 5:30 and do their job and then go home without fear of being discriminated against.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Imagine that Mr. Cochran, who is black, were an adherent of a religion that avowed the inferiority of white people, and that he distributed literature to that effect. He would not have lasted another day in a job that requires him to manage and protect the well-being of a large and diverse work force.'b'It should not matter that the investigation 'b'found no evidence'b' that Mr. Cochran had mistreated gays or lesbians. His position as a high-level public servant makes his remarks especially problematic, and requires that he be held to a different standard.'b'Unfortunately, Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers are headed in the opposite direction, considering for the second year in a row a 'b'\xe2\x80\x9creligious-freedom\xe2\x80\x9d bill'b' that, like 'b'others around the country'b', would do little more than provide legal cover for anti-gay discrimination.'b'The First Amendment already protects religious freedom. Nobody can tell Mr. Cochran what he can or cannot believe. If he wants to work as a public official, however, he may not foist his religious views on other city employees who have the right to a boss who does not speak of them as second-class citizens.'b'The legacy of America\xe2\x80\x99s war in Afghanistan, which nominally ended on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, will come into sharper focus in the coming decade. Historians will spend years figuring out what went right or wrong and which of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s programs will prove to be of lasting value.'b'There is one crucial piece of unfinished business that will speak volumes at the end of the day: whether the United States kept its promise to Afghan military interpreters who were offered the opportunity to resettle in America in recognition of the monumental risks they took.'b'Congress created special visa programs for Afghan and Iraqi military linguists starting in 2006. Early on, it was managed with callous disregard for its intended Afghan beneficiaries; only a fraction of the petitions submitted were approved. Secretary of State John Kerry has taken commendable steps over the past two years to streamline the review process and approve a higher percentage of cases. But the State Department remains hamstrung by a problem of its own making that only Congress can fix.'b'About 12,000 Afghan linguists have pending applications for the special visa. Under current law, however, the State Department has the authority to issue only 4,000 visas over the next two years. This logjam was entirely avoidable if only Washington bureaucrats had operated with greater dispatch. During some of the toughest years of the war, American officials in Kabul and Washington sat on, or rejected, the bulk of applications in the pipeline. In 2010 and 2011, for instance, only a few dozen Afghan linguists \xe2\x80\x94 an astonishingly small number \xe2\x80\x94 were allowed to immigrate.'b'At the time, some American officials in Kabul took the view that the program would worsen the country\xe2\x80\x99s brain drain and that enabling young, bilingual, educated Afghans to leave their homeland would send the wrong message about the state of a war that Washington portrayed with disingenuous optimism over the years. Many Afghan linguists actually 'b'received rejection letters'b' that described them, indefensibly and without evidence, as suspected threats.'b'The sad result was more than 6,500 visa slots that Congress set aside for the early years of the program expired, 'b'leaving brave Afghans and their families in limbo'b'. Many are living in hiding today, unable to return to their native provinces where the Taliban hold sway.'b'Fortunately, their plight came to the attention of American servicemen and servicewomen, who have lobbied their representatives in Congress seeking help. As the scope of the problem became clear to lawmakers, a remarkable if unlikely coalition from opposite ends of the political spectrum came together in an effort to undo a monumental wrong.'b'In the House, Representative 'b'Earl Blumenauer'b', an Oregon Democrat, and Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois who is a former Air Force pilot, led the effort last year to 'b'extend the program'b' and authorize the 4,000 visa slots currently available. In the Senate, John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat from New Hampshire, championed the cause.'b'In an era of partisan acrimony and gridlock on Capitol Hill, their leadership on this issue has been inspirational. But much remains to be done. The White House will soon present to Congress a budget request that will almost certainly include provisions to create new visa slots for Afghan linguists. Lawmakers should ensure those are financed and approved either as part of the defense bill, if they actually manage to pass one this year, or through stand-alone legislation.'b'Failing to give all eligible and deserving applicants a fair shot at a new start in the United States would represent an abdication of a promise that helped persuade linguists to put their lives on the line. That would add a shameful chapter to the legacy of a war that has been grim enough for Afghans.'b'AMSTERDAM \xe2\x80\x94 Something snapped. I was 13 years old, dreaming of books and girls and nothing else \xe2\x80\x94 a healthy Dutch kid with a Moroccan background who freewheeled through life. Then something happened that made me feel different from the pack. One day in history class, the fatwa against Salman Rushdie became the subject. Our teacher talked about freedom of expression; I talked about insulting the Prophet. There was an awkward silence. What was that Abdelkader guy talking about? Fatwhat?'b'But our teacher, Mr. Fok, understood me. He claimed the fatwa didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense. How could somebody be offended by fiction? How could using one\xe2\x80\x99s imagination lead to the death sentence?'b'I remember standing up, my voice rising as I struggled to make an argument about the holiness of the Prophet to me and my community. And the more Mr. Fok responded with cold and rational analysis the angrier I got. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he get that this was about more than reason and common sense? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t he get that mocking the Prophet was a moral crime?'b'My classmates looked at me like a madman. By then I was standing and shouting. I\xe2\x80\x99d never felt such anger before. This wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about a novel, this was about me. About us. I wanted revenge. Mr. Fok just looked at me, amazed by my temper and a bit annoyed, and dismissed me from class.'b'For the first time in my life I felt what it meant to be Muslim. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to feel that way. I wanted to blend in, to look normal like the other kids in my class. After the frustration and anger ebbed, I felt shame \xe2\x80\x94 for letting my religion down, letting my family down, letting myself down. Shame for an anger I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.'b'I grew up in a relatively traditional Moroccan family. We observed Ramadan but my father rarely went to the mosque. There were two books in our house, the Quran and the phone book. We never looked at either of them.'b'We didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk much about the fatwa but it was impossible to ignore. Muslims were marching through the streets of Rotterdam. It was the first time we felt seen as part of a community that had questions to answer: Which side are you on? Why are you offended? Where does this anger come from? Can Islam coexist with Western values?'b'The world didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop reminding me I was a Muslim. My name, my background, my skin, my family and the events unfolding in the world all led to more self-questioning.'b'Islam told me God is One and the Prophet is his messenger. Adhere to the five pillars and all will be well. But we were living in a non-Muslim country. But I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Dutch, nor was I secular. I had to find a way to reconcile my religious background with a secular world. I felt orphaned.'b'And resolving that dilemma is much harder in a secular society that seems to have stopped struggling with these big questions altogether.'b'In the end, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t find the answers in holy texts. I found them in literature.'b'I read Kafka\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMetamorphosis\xe2\x80\x9d and Camus\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cThe Plague.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought back on my younger days lashing out against \xe2\x80\x9cThe Satanic Verses.\xe2\x80\x9d I remembered sneaking into a bookshop and seeing the book piled up ready to be read but my English was insufficient to understand it. The book turned me away; the curiosity stayed.'b'When I was 17, I found \xe2\x80\x9cThe Satanic Verses\xe2\x80\x9d tucked away in a school library. I grabbed it, started reading and was mesmerized. Here was a young man struggling with his faith in a faithless world \xe2\x80\x94 an immigrant son from a deeply religious home thrown into a world where everything is embraced and nothing is sacred. It confirmed what I had felt deep inside: a free and open society is a threat to religious people. Their religion will be mocked \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes even suppressed \xe2\x80\x94 and this will provoke anger.'b'And now it\xe2\x80\x99s happening again. The rise of extremists who lure young Muslims in the West with visions of Islamic utopia is creating nausea among European Muslims. Boys and girls are leaving their families and being converted into killing machines. They are leaving not from Baghdad but from Brussels and The Hague. We insist that this can\xe2\x80\x99t be our Islam and if this is Islam we don\xe2\x80\x99t want it. But I know from my own experience that the lure of extremism can be very powerful when you grow up in a world where the media and everyone around you seems to mock and insult your culture.'b'And European governments are not helping fight extremism by giving in to Islamophobia cooked up by right-wing populists. What I see is a lack of courage to embrace the Muslims of Europe as genuinely European \xe2\x80\x94 as citizens like everyone else.'b'One of the first people the terrorists in Paris killed was one of us: Mustapha Ourrad, an Algerian-born copy editor at Charlie Hebdo. Then they killed another Muslim: the police officer, Ahmed Merabet. The killers didn\xe2\x80\x99t take mercy on them. In the name of Islam they killed Muslims. And every time a European Muslim sees that image of Mr. Merabet\xe2\x80\x99s last moments, he sees himself lying there on the cold pavement. Helpless. And the next question will be: What will I say tomorrow at work or at school?'b'What happened last week is not about lack of humor, or a failure to understand caricature. Nor is it about hatred of the West. It\xe2\x80\x99s about anger taking a wrong turn.'b'What makes us human and creative is our doubt. But doubt on its own can turn into anger and fundamentalism.'b'As the French writer Michel Houellebecq said in an interview: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople cannot live without God. Life becomes unbearable.\xe2\x80\x9d The terrorists found their God in a godless society. Charlie Hebdo mocked their God by declaring him nothing more than a cartoon. They came back to rescue their God and left 12 dead behind. They fell prey to a powerful delusion.'b'It was the same delusion I felt as a teenager: that by attacking the messenger your anger will disappear and you will be victorious. But the only way to conquer your anger is to understand where its roots lie. For me the freedom to doubt, to not choose sides and to feel empathy for characters and people with whom I disagree was liberating. Today I still embrace my Islamic background, but without the dogma, repression and strict adherence to ritual.'b'Since 9/11, so many European Muslims have also doubted their belonging. Do they belong to the Paris of Voltaire or the Mecca of Muhammad? It\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong question.'b'Muslims are every bit as European as the Roma, gays, intellectuals, farmers and factory workers. We have been in Europe for centuries and politicians and the press must stop acting is if we arrived yesterday. We are here to stay.'b'TORONTO \xe2\x80\x94 The Sri Lanka that Pope Francis is now visiting to canonize an 18th-century missionary is a radically different country than it was just one week ago. The difference: He will be greeted by a new president, Maithripala Sirisena, a onetime ally and cabinet minister of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the former president who failed in his bid to secure a third term.'b'When Mr. Rajapaksa called the early election, in November, few thought the outcome would be anything other than a greater consolidation of his increasingly entrenched position in the country. His nearly 10 years in power undeniably transformed Sri Lanka: Mr. Rajapaksa presided over the end to the island nation\xe2\x80\x99s long-running and brutal civil war in 2009, when government forces conclusively defeated the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a terrorist group that for decades used guerrilla warfare and suicide bombings to fight for a separate homeland for the Tamil-majority areas in the north and east. Since then, with significant backing from China, Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s government has brought off ambitious infrastructure projects like new highways, airports and seaports in a country devastated by years of war and by the 2004 tsunami.'b'During this same period, as his power and popularity have increased, he has resisted both domestic and international calls for investigations of human rights abuses related to the civil war and its aftermath, while passing over important questions about the resettlement of displaced persons and the delegation of power in the Tamil-majority regions.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise then that he has often been likened, by both supporters and critics, to a latter-day incarnation of an all-powerful ancient Ceylonese king, complete with family members at the helm of important ministries; a loyal and shadowy security apparatus; robust backing from the military and the Buddhist religious establishment; and \xe2\x80\x94 helped along by his skills as a folksy but regal retail politician \xe2\x80\x94 widespread support in Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s many Buddhist-majority villages.'b'When, during the Rajapaksa years, I met with English-speaking Sri Lankan writers and intellectuals, a tiny minority in this country of my parents\xe2\x80\x99 birth, I heard many caustic critiques of the regime, over gin and tonics under the banyan tree shade of Colombo courtyard cafes. Meanwhile, the hired drivers, who came from a far greater portion of the population, playing on their cellphones and reading Sinhala-language newspapers while waiting for us in nearby lots, were openly and grandly proud of \xe2\x80\x9ctheir\xe2\x80\x9d president, who defeated the awful Tamil Tigers, defied international critics and rebuilt their shattered island.'b'So how could he have lost to a virtual unknown? This was wildly unexpected, given his accomplishments to date and seeming popularity and his warning on the campaign trail that the nation was liable to suffer social unrest along the lines of post-dictatorship Libya, Syria and Egypt if he lost. Even Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s self-important and self-styled \xe2\x80\x9croyal astrologer,\xe2\x80\x9d Sumanadasa Abeygunawardena, was persuaded by his reading of the stars \xe2\x80\x94 in a country where astrology plays an influential role \xe2\x80\x94 that the president could not be defeated in the election. As the astrologer sagely explained, re-election was certain: \xe2\x80\x9cThe president, he has such auspicious time and so much power in his planetary position that he cannot be defeated in an election.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fact is, citizens in voting booths \xe2\x80\x94 the sacred privacy at the heart of democracy \xe2\x80\x94 revealed just how little power Mr. Rajapaksa really had. This is the case, even as the public perception suggested otherwise. When I visited Sri Lanka last summer, speaking with various hired drivers provided, as ever, a reliable barometer of the national mood. I was struck then by their sudden and uniform silence whenever the president or members of his family came up in conversation. And they came up often enough, mostly as my wife and I remarked on the ubiquitous presence of Mr. Rajapaksa in the country, the president, his brothers and other family members smiling beatifically on huge billboards positioned at important junctions in most every city and village that we visited.'b'Why were these drivers, otherwise congenitally loquacious, whose predecessors plumped up with pride when \xe2\x80\x9ctheir president\xe2\x80\x9d was mentioned, suddenly so silent? In fact, one driver was willing to say one thing, very quietly, before he changed the topic: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s become too much.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s new president, Mr. Sirisena, campaigned directly against the excesses of the Rajapaksa years. He also has vowed to change the Constitution during his early time in office to diminish the greater powers Mr. Rajapaksa arrogated to the office of the presidency. Beyond that, and equally welcome, Mr. Sirisena has called for an end to nepotistic corruption, and for a frank reconsideration of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s opaque financial arrangements with China. He has more generally promised an austere approach to daily and national life, in keeping with the Buddhist emphasis on self-denial. In this respect, he offers a continuity with Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s religio-nationalism, if in a different guise. Likewise, during the campaign he did not advance any notable new plans for addressing the unresolved post-civil war situation faced by many in the country\xe2\x80\x99s Tamil minority.'b'He is now faced with the necessary challenge of assembling a workable government out of the fellow dissidents and fractious opposition groups he united in his bid against the incumbent, a new government that inherits a state infrastructure that has been bent around the needs and interests of one man and his family. In other words, Mr. Sirisena has so far accomplished exactly half of an extraordinary feat. He\xe2\x80\x99s defied the very stars in defeating an authoritarian president, but now what?'b'On Tuesday, Pope Francis arrived in a suddenly new Sri Lanka to preside over the celebration of a Catholic missionary from centuries past lately credited with miraculous powers. This was joyful news for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s small but historic Catholic population. What all of Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s people now require from their new president and his government is a more mundane but much-needed political miracle: the right ordering of its national life to become more sustainable and inclusive, and less about the outsize powers of any one man, including himself.'b'The far-right National Front has made gains following the attack on the offices of Charlie Hebdo.'b'One response to the despicable attacks in Paris would be for newspapers throughout the civilized world to publish cartoons that gently poke fun at all religions.

If magazines or journalists are attacking Islam by means of cartoons, articles, letters and so forth, then it becomes the responsibility of the Muslim world to reply with logical arguments by utilizing the media. They must present the peaceful nature of the Prophet Muhammad, who in the times of adversity displayed brilliant steadfastness.

Beyond the slogans and marveling at the vast turnout, what\xe2\x80\x99s required in France is real change. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s biggest Muslim population is confined for the most part to rundown suburbs. Youth unemployment is rampant, among Muslims in particular, and discrimination is prevalent against second- and even third-generation descendants of immigrants from France\xe2\x80\x99s former colonies. This has led to many of France\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim youths becoming disenfranchised and, in extreme cases, radicalized.

The destruction of Jewish businesses recalled painful images of past suffering endured by Europe\xe2\x80\x99s Jews, including the violent attacks on Jewish merchants on Kristallnacht, the infamous night of Nov. 9, 1938, which was the beginning of the Nazi pogrom against Austrian and German Jews. In France, 75,000 French Jews were deported to Nazi concentration camps during World War II.'b'It is no wonder that feelings of insecurity and isolation have resurfaced, and that some French Jews are asking themselves if they have a future in France, home to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s largest Jewish population.

In addition to the deep grief she felt for losing a child, she also had to bear the rage and sniping comments of protesters outside a clinic who had utterly no idea of her personal situation \xe2\x80\x94 and certainly no right to intervene in a way that brought her more pain and suffering.'b'SALLY PEABODY'b'\nMedford, Mass., Jan. 3, 2015'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Razib Khan addressed surprising differences in opinion on abortion between the sexes among conservatives and liberals.

They would significantly limit a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose. The majority did not believe that a woman who is poor and unable to afford another child should have a legal right to an abortion. Two-thirds would require parental consent for a woman younger than 18 to obtain an abortion. Yet 62 percent wanted the Supreme Court to preserve the 1973 Roe v.

People around the world have asked (but, as in the past, have not all seriously examined) this question since last week\xe2\x80\x99s horrific attacks on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and on a kosher supermarket in Paris.'b'In fact, Muslim statesmen, clerics and intellectuals have added their voices to condemnations of terror by leaders around the world. But they must undertake another essential task: Address and reinterpret Islam\xe2\x80\x99s traditional take on \xe2\x80\x9cblasphemy,\xe2\x80\x9d or insult to the sacred.'b'The Paris terrorists were apparently fueled by the zeal to punish blasphemy, and fervor for the same cause has bred militancy in the name of Islam in various other incidents, ranging from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini\xe2\x80\x99s fatwa against the writer Salman Rushdie in 1989 to the threats and protests against the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten for publishing cartoons lampooning the Prophet Muhammad in 2005.'b'Mockery of Muhammad, actual or perceived, has been at the heart of nearly all of these controversies over blasphemy.'b'This might seem unremarkable at first, but there is something curious about it, for the Prophet Muhammad is not the only sacred figure in Islam. The Quran praises other prophets \xe2\x80\x94 such as Abraham, Moses and Jesus \xe2\x80\x94 and even tells Muslims to \xe2\x80\x9cmake no distinction\xe2\x80\x9d between these messengers of God. Yet for some reason, Islamist extremists seem to obsess only about the Prophet Muhammad.'b'Even more curiously, mockery of God \xe2\x80\x94 what one would expect to see as the most outrageous blasphemy \xe2\x80\x94 seems to have escaped their attention as well. Satirical magazines such as Charlie Hebdo have run cartoons ridiculing God (in the Jewish, Christian and Muslim contexts), but they were targeted with violence only when they ridiculed the Prophet Muhammad.'b'Of course, this is not to say extremists should threaten and harm cartoonists for more diverse theological reasons; obviously, they should not target them at all. But the exclusive focus on the Prophet Muhammad is worth pondering. One obvious explanation is that while God and the other prophets are also sacred for Judaism and Christianity, the Prophet Muhammad is sacred only for Muslims. In other words, the zeal comes not from merely respect for the sacred, but from militancy for what\xe2\x80\x99s sacred to us \xe2\x80\x94 us being the community of Muslims. So the unique sensitivity around Muhammad seems to be a case of religious nationalism, with its focus on the earthly community \xe2\x80\x94 rather than of true faith, whose main focus should be the divine.'b'Still, this religious nationalism is guided by religious law \xe2\x80\x94 Shariah \xe2\x80\x94 that includes clauses about punishing blasphemy as a deadly sin. It is thus of vital importance that Muslim scholars courageously, even audaciously, address this issue today. They can begin by acknowledging that, while Shariah is rooted in the divine, the overwhelming majority of its injunctions are man-made, partly reflecting the values and needs of the seventh to 12th centuries \xe2\x80\x94 when no part of the world was liberal, and other religions, such as Christianity, also considered blasphemy a capital crime.'b'The only source in Islamic law that all Muslims accept indisputably is the Quran. And, conspicuously, the Quran decrees no earthly punishment for blasphemy \xe2\x80\x94 or for apostasy (abandonment or renunciation of the faith), a related concept. Nor, for that matter, does the Quran command stoning, female circumcision or a ban on fine arts. All these doctrinal innovations, as it were, were brought into the literature of Islam as medieval scholars interpreted it, according to the norms of their time and milieu.'b'Tellingly, severe punishments for blasphemy and apostasy appeared when increasingly despotic Muslim empires needed to find a religious justification to eliminate political opponents.'b'One of the earliest \xe2\x80\x9cblasphemers\xe2\x80\x9d in Islam was the pious scholar Ghaylan al-Dimashqi, who was executed in the 8th century by the Umayyad Empire. His main \xe2\x80\x9cheresy\xe2\x80\x9d was to insist that rulers did not have the right to regard their power as \xe2\x80\x9ca gift of God,\xe2\x80\x9d and that they had to be aware of their responsibility to the people.'b'Before all that politically motivated expansion and toughening of Shariah, though, the Quran told early Muslims, who routinely faced the mockery of their faith by pagans: \xe2\x80\x9cGod has told you in the Book that when you hear God\xe2\x80\x99s revelations disbelieved in and mocked at, do not sit with them until they enter into some other discourse; surely then you would be like them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just \xe2\x80\x9cdo not sit with them\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is the response the Quran suggests for mockery. Not violence. Not even censorship.'b'Wise Muslim religious leaders from the entire world would do Islam a great favor if they preached and reiterated such a nonviolent and nonoppressive stance in the face of insults against Islam. That sort of instruction could also help their more intolerant coreligionists understand that rage is a sign of nothing but immaturity. The power of any faith comes not from its coercion of critics and dissenters. It comes from the moral integrity and the intellectual strength of its believers.'b'President Obama was criticized for failing to attend, or send a proper surrogate to, the giant antiterrorism march in Paris on Sunday. That criticism was right. But it is typical of American politics today that we focus on this and not what would have really made the world feel the jihadist threat was finally being seriously confronted. And that would not be a march that our president helps to lead, but one in which he\xe2\x80\x99s not involved at all. That would be a million-person march against the jihadists across the Arab-Muslim world, organized by Arabs and Muslims for Arabs and Muslims, without anyone in the West asking for it \xe2\x80\x94 not just because of what happened in Paris but because of the scores of Muslims recently murdered by jihadists in Pakistan, Yemen, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria and Syria.'b'Abdul Rahman al-Rashed, one of the most respected Arab journalists, wrote Monday in his column in\xc2\xa0Al-Sharq Al-Awsat:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cProtests against the recent terrorist attacks in France should have been held in Muslim capitals, rather than Paris, because, in this case, it is Muslims who are involved in this crisis and stand accused. ... The story of extremism begins in Muslim societies, and it is with their support and silence that extremism has grown into terrorism that is harming people. It is of no value that the French people, who are the victims here, take to the streets. ... What is required here is for Muslim communities to disown the Paris crime and Islamic extremism in general.\xe2\x80\x9d ('b'Translation by Memri.org'b'.)'b'The truth is there is a huge amount of ambivalence toward this whole jihadist phenomenon \xe2\x80\x94 more than any of us would like to believe \xe2\x80\x94 in the Arab-Muslim world, Europe and America. This ambivalence starts in the Muslim community, where there is a deep cleavage over what constitutes authentic Islam today. We fool ourselves when we tell Muslims what \xe2\x80\x9creal Islam\xe2\x80\x9d is. Because Islam has no Vatican, no single source of religious authority, there are many Islams today. The puritanical Wahhabi/Salafi/jihadist strain is one of them, and its support is not insignificant.'b'Ambivalence runs through Europe today on the question of what a country should demand of new Muslim immigrants by way of adopting its values. Is 'b'Stratfor\xe2\x80\x99s George Friedman'b' right when he argues that Europeans adopted multiculturalism precisely because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really want to absorb their Muslim immigrants, and many of those Muslim immigrants, who went to Europe to find a job, not a new identity, didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to be absorbed? If so, that spells trouble.'b'Ambivalence runs through Washington\xe2\x80\x99s ties with Saudi Arabia. Ever since jihadists took over Islam\xe2\x80\x99s holiest shrine in Mecca in 1979, proclaiming that Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s rulers were not pious enough, Saudi Arabia has redoubled its commitment to Wahhabi or Salafist Islam \xe2\x80\x94 the most puritanical, anti-pluralistic and anti-women version of that faith. This Saudi right turn \xe2\x80\x94 combined with oil revenues used to build Wahhabi-inspired mosques, websites and madrassas across the Muslim world \xe2\x80\x94 has tilted the entire Sunni community to the right. Look at a picture of female graduates of Cairo University in 1950. Few are wearing veils. Look at them today. Many are wearing veils. The open, soft, embracing Islam that defined Egypt for centuries \xe2\x80\x94 pray five times a day but wash it down with a beer at night \xe2\x80\x94 has been hardened by this Wahhabi wind from Arabia.'b'But U.S. presidents never confront Saudi Arabia about this because of our oil addiction. As I\xe2\x80\x99ve said, addicts never tell the truth to their pushers. The Saudi government opposes the jihadists. Unfortunately, though, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very short step from Wahhabi Islam to the violent jihadism practiced by the Islamic State, or ISIS. The French terrorists were born in France but were marinated in Wahhabi-Salafi thought through the web and local mosques \xe2\x80\x94 not Voltaire.'b'Also, the other civil war in Islam \xe2\x80\x94 between Sunnis and Shiites \xe2\x80\x94 has led many mainstream Sunni charities, mosques and regimes to support jihadist groups because they\xe2\x80\x99re ferocious fighters against Shiites.\xc2\xa0Finally \xe2\x80\x94 yet more ambivalence \xe2\x80\x94 for 60 years there was a tacit alliance between Arab dictators and their Sunni religious clergy. The regimes funded these uninspired Muslim clerics, and these clergy blessed the uninspired dictators\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94 and both stifled the emergence of any authentic, inspired, reformist Islam that could take on Wahhabism-Salafism, even though many Muslims wanted it. An authentic reformation requires a free space in the Arab-Muslim world.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMuslims need to \xe2\x80\x98upgrade their software,\xe2\x80\x99 which is programmed mainly by our schools, television and mosques \xe2\x80\x94 especially small mosques that trade in what is forbidden,\xe2\x80\x9d Egyptian intellectual Mamoun Fandy wrote in Al-Sharq Al-Awsat. ('b'Also translated by Memri.org.'b') \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no choice but to dismantle this system and rebuild it in a way that is compatible with human culture and values.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In short, jihadist zeal is easy to condemn, but will require multiple revolutions to stem \xe2\x80\x94 revolutions that will require a lot of people in the Arab-Muslim world and West to shed their ambivalence and stop playing double games.'b'Can 'b'Jeb Bush'b' win the Republican presidential nomination while defying the most ideologically committed wing of his party?'b''b'Bill Clinton'b' did this successfully in 1992, when he staked out conservative stands opposed by the liberal wing of his party \xe2\x80\x94 the so-called 'b'Sister Souljah strategy'b', designed to distance himself from the dogma of the left generally and from Jesse Jackson specifically.'b'Over the past 23 years, however, the voting public has become more 'b'politically consistent'b', with the Democratic left and Republican right each exerting greater influence on their respective parties, particularly in primary elections.'b'In 1994, as 'b'Figure 1'b' shows, median Republican and Democratic voters were relatively close to each other, near the center on an ideological scale. According to Pew, 30 percent of Democrats were liberals and 45 percent of Republicans were conservatives. Fifty-three percent of Democrats and 44 percent of Republicans at that time fell in the middle range. This provided a base of support for candidates of both parties to run campaigns accommodating centrist voters.'b'As Figure 2 shows, only 34 percent of Republicans and 36 percent of Democrats today fall 'b'into the middle range'b'. The percentage of liberal Democrats has nearly doubled, from 30 percent in 1994 to 56 percent in 2014. The percentage of conservative Republicans has grown from 45 to 53 percent. As a result, Jeb Bush has fewer moderate Republicans to rely on as a base in his primary bid for the nomination than Clinton had among moderate Democrats in 1992.'b'Clinton defied liberals when he backed the death penalty and called for an end to long-term welfare. Most famously, in June 1992 Clinton attacked Jesse Jackson at a Rainbow Coalition event for giving the podium to the rap singer Sister Souljah, whom Clinton compared to the white supremacist David Duke. Souljah had 'b'told'b' The Washington Post:'b'Clinton issued his 'b'public rebuke'b' to Souljah and Jackson in part as a signal that he would focus on stemming the outflow of whites from the Democratic Party.'b'In a roughly similar way, Bush has decided to confront his party\xe2\x80\x99s right wing on issues of immigration, the Common Core and 'b'same-sex marriage'b'. The closest he has come to a Sister Souljah moment so far was on April 6, 2014, when he told a gathering celebrating the 25th anniversary of his father\xe2\x80\x99s presidency that for many illegal immigrants, crossing the border \xe2\x80\x9c'b'is not a felony. It\xe2\x80\x99s an act of love'b'\xe2\x80\x9d:'b'Bush\xe2\x80\x99s remarks set off a fury. The 'b'Associated Press reported'b' that'b'The Democratic pollster 'b'Geoff Garin'b' argued in a phone interview that a candidate seeking the Republican presidential nomination on a pro-immigration platform was like a politician seeking the Democratic nomination \xe2\x80\x9cas a pro-life candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d Immigration, Garin says, \xe2\x80\x9cis a \xe2\x80\x98signifier\xe2\x80\x99 issue for a lot of voters. The Republican rank and file have very strong views on immigration with a real passion attached to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Stan Greenberg'b', a Democratic strategist who agrees with Garin, contended in an interview that \xe2\x80\x9cimmigration has become the dominant issue\xe2\x80\x9d for a majority of Republican primary voters. This will make it difficult for Bush if the nomination fight turns into a two-person contest between Bush and an anti-immigration candidate.'b'An unknown factor is how much leeway Bush has because of his wife, Columba, who is Latina. The story of his marriage, as described in a 1999 feature in the 'b'Florida Sun Sentinel'b', has considerable appeal:'b'The Sun Sentinel goes on to describe the couple\xe2\x80\x99s initial encounter in Mexico in 1971:'b'Bush\xe2\x80\x99s conservative credentials have historically been robust. In 2004, while governor of Florida, Bush wrote'b' to constituents'b' that he would consider supporting a constitutional amendment restricting marriage to a man and a woman if the courts threatened to overturn Florida\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex marriage.'b'Recently, however, Bush has demonstrated a notable open-mindedness on social and cultural issues \xe2\x80\x93 a posture, generally speaking, which is anathema to the 'b'Tea Party'b', but advantageous in a general election.'b'On Jan. 5, the same sex marriage ban 'b'was formally lifted'b' in Miami-Dade County.

He 'b'told The Washington Post'b' that Republican support grew for legislation providing a path to citizenship when other requirements were added. A 'b' National Journal poll'b' in July 2013, for example, found that while only 18 percent of Republicans supported passage of a liberal Senate immigration bill, backing grew to 60 percent if the measure was amended to toughen border security.'b'A question that polling does not answer is how much leeway Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s unique ties to Hispanic America buy him.

And, if he does, will his party allow him to make use of it?'b'The lifting of the California ban against selling foie gras (the hyperfattened liver of geese or ducks, brought about by overfeeding the live animals) is pretty much a nonissue, except to point out that as a nation we have little perspective on animal welfare. To single out the tiniest fraction of meat production and label it \xe2\x80\x9ccruel\xe2\x80\x9d is to miss the big picture, and the big picture is this: Almost all meat production in the United States is cruel.'b'The sale and production of foie gras was prohibited in California in 2012.

But it also may be because caviar doesn\xe2\x80\x99t invoke horrible images of 'b'gavage'b', as the process of overfeeding poultry is called \xe2\x80\x94 images that feature, not to put too fine a point on it, funnels.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not a pretty thought, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a less pretty sight. Of course, 'b'foie gras can also be produced without actually force-feeding'b' because, like many animals \xe2\x80\x94 including humans and dogs \xe2\x80\x94 ducks and geese will happily eat anything that meets their standards. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to force them: They will stuff themselves anyway. So although the process may be \xe2\x80\x9cunnatural,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9ctorture.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As to whether this is \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d for the animals, that\xe2\x80\x99s another question. But let\xe2\x80\x99s get our priorities straight. Statistically, foie gras is insignificant; according to a spokesman at Hudson Valley Foie Gras, one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s main producers, the market in the United States involves just under 600,000 animals per year.'b'My elementary math estimates that the United States chicken broiler industry kills more birds than that every single hour of every single day. (We produced an estimated 38.5 billion pounds of chicken in 2014, at an average of 6 pounds per bird.) Almost all of those birds are raised in conditions that range from unnatural to torturous.'b'If you allow that the same is true of most animals raised in the United States, from dairy cows (which last year produced roughly 206 billion pounds of milk) to egg-laying hens (over 98 billion eggs) to cattle raised for beef (24 billion pounds), you are looking at an industry that produces cruelty on a scale that\xe2\x80\x99s so big and overwhelming few of us can consider it rationally or regularly. And if you consider that cattle, for example, evolved to graze on grasses and are often fattened on grains \xe2\x80\x94 to which their digestive systems must then adapt \xe2\x80\x94 you might say that part of that industry\xe2\x80\x99s routine is force-feeding.'b'This is not to say a few thousand ducks and geese don\xe2\x80\x99t matter; it is to say that it\xe2\x80\x99s important to keep perspective. Although the plaintiffs used a federal statute (see the Poultry Products Inspection Act) to overturn the ban, and although that makes some animal welfare advocates uneasy, federal law is often used to trump state regulations, both good and bad. The legal experts I spoke to were wary, but did not see that this ruling, for example, set a precedent that might threaten California\xe2\x80\x99s new egg-raising requirements, 'b'about which I wrote on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day'b'.'b'So, since this is not the last word on foie gras in California (or elsewhere), let\xe2\x80\x99s stay tuned. If it\xe2\x80\x99s ultimately and legally determined that foie gras production is cruel, inhumane or both, labeling it so would strengthen the argument that so are the current means of production for most industrially raised animals (and their products). This is best seen as a test case, not as a significant defeat or victory. Foie gras itself just isn\xe2\x80\x99t that important.'b'IN 1974, I graduated from Skyline High School in Oakland, Calif., an underachieving student with lousy SAT scores. Allowed to send my results to three colleges, I chose M.I.T. and Villanova, knowing such fine schools would never accept a student like me but hoping they\xe2\x80\x99d toss some car stickers my way for taking a shot. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford tuition for college anyway. I sent my final set of stats to 'b'Chabot'b', a community college in nearby Hayward, Calif., which, because it accepted everyone and was free, would be my alma mater.'b'For thousands of commuting students, Chabot was our Columbia, Annapolis, even our Sorbonne, offering courses in physics, stenography, auto mechanics, certified public accounting, foreign languages, journalism \xe2\x80\x94 name the art or science, the subject or trade, and it was probably in the catalog. The college had a nursing program that churned out graduates, sports teams that funneled athletes to big-time programs, and parking for a few thousand cars \xe2\x80\x94 all free but for the effort and the cost of used textbooks.'b'Classmates included veterans back from Vietnam, women of every marital and maternal status returning to school, middle-aged men wanting to improve their employment prospects and paychecks. We could get our general education requirements out of the way at Chabot \xe2\x80\x94 credits we could transfer to a university \xe2\x80\x94 which made those two years an invaluable head start. I was able to go on to the 'b'State University'b' in Sacramento (at $95 a semester, just barely affordable) and study no other subject but my major, theater arts. (After a year there I moved on, enrolling in a little thing called the School of Hard Knocks, a.k.a. Life.)'b'By some fluke of the punch-card computer era, I made Chabot\xe2\x80\x99s dean\xe2\x80\x99s list taking classes I loved (oral interpretation), classes I loathed (health, a requirement), classes I aced (film as art \xe2\x80\x94 like Jean Renoir\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGolden Coach\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and Luis Bu\xc3\xb1uel\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSimon of the Desert\xe2\x80\x9d'b'), and classes I dropped after the first hour (astronomy, because it was all math). I nearly failed zoology, killing my fruit flies by neglect, but got lucky in an English course, \xe2\x80\x9cThe College Reading Experience.\xe2\x80\x9d The books of 'b'Carlos Castaneda'b' were incomprehensible to me (and still are), but my assigned presentation on the analytic process called structural dynamics was hailed as clear and concise, though I did nothing more than embellish the definition I had looked up in the dictionary.'b'A public speaking class was unforgettable for a couple of reasons. First, the assignments forced us to get over our self-consciousness. Second, another student was a stewardess, as flight attendants called themselves in the \xe2\x80\x9970s. She was studying communications and was gorgeous. She lived not far from me, and when my VW threw a rod and was in the shop for a week, she offered me a lift to class. I rode shotgun that Monday-Wednesday-Friday totally tongue-tied. Communicating with her one on one was the antithesis of public speaking.'b'Classes I took at Chabot have rippled through my professional pond. I produced the HBO mini-series \xe2\x80\x9cJohn Adams\xe2\x80\x9d with an outline format I learned from a pipe-smoking historian, James Coovelis, whose lectures were riveting. Mary Lou Fitzgerald\xe2\x80\x99s Studies in Shakespeare taught me how the five-act structures of \xe2\x80\x9cRichard III,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tempest\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cOthello\xe2\x80\x9d focused their themes.'b'In Herb Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s Drama in Performance, I read plays like 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Hot L Baltimore\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDesire Under the Elms,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' then saw their productions. I got to see the plays he taught, through student rush tickets at the American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco and the Berkeley Repertory Theater. Those plays filled my head with expanded dreams. I got an A.'b'Of course, I goofed off between classes eating French fries and looking at girls; such are the pleasures, too, of schools that cost thousands of bucks a semester. Some hours I idled away in the huge library that anchored Chabot\xe2\x80\x99s oval quad. It\xe2\x80\x99s where I first read The New York Times, frustrated by its lack of comics.'b'If Chabot\xe2\x80\x99s library still has its collection of vinyl records, you will find my name repeatedly on the takeout slip of Jason Robards\xe2\x80\x99s performance of the monologues of Eugene O\xe2\x80\x99Neill. On Side B he was Hickey, from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Iceman Cometh,\xe2\x80\x9d a recording I listened to 20 times at least. When I worked with Mr. Robards on the 1993 film \xe2\x80\x9cPhiladelphia,\xe2\x80\x9d he confessed to recording those monologues at 10 in the morning after lots and lots of coffee.'b'President Obama hopes to make 'b'two years of free community college accessible'b' for up to nine million Americans. I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing the new Congress will squawk at the 'b'$60 billion price tag'b', but I hope the idea sticks, because more veterans, from Iraq and Afghanistan this time, as well as another generation of mothers, single parents and workers who have been out of the job market, need lower obstacles between now and the next chapter of their lives. High school graduates without the finances for a higher education can postpone taking on big loans and maybe luck into the class that will redefine their life\xe2\x80\x99s work. Many lives will be changed.'b'Chabot College is still in Hayward, though Mr. Coovelis, Ms. Fitzgerald and Mr. Kennedy are no longer there. I drove past the campus a few years ago with one of my kids and summed up my two years there this way: \xe2\x80\x9cThat place made me what I am today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama this week 'b'proposed'b' privacy laws that could give Americans greater control over their personal information. But Republicans in Congress will likely undermine or ignore many of the measures.'b'Some of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'ideas'b' should have bipartisan appeal. For example, he wants to forbid companies from using data about students that they collect when they sell software and services to primary and secondary schools for marketing purposes. That measure is based on a law that 'b' California adopted 'b'last year with Democratic and Republican votes in the State Legislature. Most members of Congress would have a hard time justifying voting against a bill that sought to protect the privacy of minors.'b'But another proposal in Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s package could result in less protection for consumers. It would require retailers, banks and other companies who have been hacked to notify customers whose data had been stolen within 30 days after officials learned of the breach. The problem is that such a law could invalidate existing state laws and prevent states from enacting new privacy laws.'b'Most states and the District of Columbia already have disclosure laws. Alabama, New Mexico and South Dakota do not. Some states have laws that are stronger than what Mr. Obama proposed. For example, California, Connecticut and New Jersey generally 'b'require notification'b' of a data breach as soon as possible. Many states allow consumers to \xe2\x80\x9cfreeze\xe2\x80\x9d credit reports so that hackers cannot sign up for credit cards and loans in their names. Other states allow residents to sue businesses for not protecting their data. Privacy law experts say Congress could use a data breach laws to pre-empt these state requirements.'b'Mr. Obama and 'b'lawmakers in Congress'b' say a federal law would establish a national standard for businesses to follow. As a practical matter, privacy advocates say, companies are not hamstrung by having to follow different state policies because they usually do whatever is required by the strongest state law in all states. Another problem with the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is that it does not require businesses to improve the security of their computer systems so data are not stolen in the first place.'b'There is no doubt that federal law does not adequately protect the privacy of Americans. Numerous reports produced by 'b'Congress'b', the 'b'Federal Trade Commission'b' and newspapers including 'b'The Times'b' have documented the widespread collection of data like Internet browsing histories, retail store purchases and health information. Some companies known as data brokers organize and analyze vast sums of such data into dossiers on individuals and families that can be used to target people based on their medical conditions, economic desperation and their willingness to spend money.'b'In 2012, Mr. Obama wisely called for a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'privacy bill of rights'b'\xe2\x80\x9d that would give individuals more control over how their information is collected and used. The president now says his administration will produce such a bill of rights in the next 45 days. But nobody realistically expects the current Republican-led Congress to adopt a strong law that truly empowers consumers.'b''b'State lawmakers'b' in California, Oklahoma, Texas and elsewhere have been willing to pass privacy laws. Those efforts are insufficient, but at least those lawmakers are trying, unlike members of Congress who have taken little interest in a privacy bill of rights because Internet companies and advertisers have heavily lobbied against it. That is why Mr. Obama must be careful not to give Congress an opportunity to undermine state laws.'b'What is a year of your life worth? How about 10 years? Or 20? In many ways the question is unanswerable: Who can assign a dollar amount to the experience of watching a child grow up, of being able to care for an elderly parent?'b'But when the government has wrongfully convicted and imprisoned someone, a cash payout is the most meaningful way to make amends and achieve some measure of belated justice.'b'Scott Stringer, the New York City comptroller, appears to understand this. On Sunday, Mr. Stringer\xe2\x80\x99s office 'b'announced'b' payments totaling $17 million to three men who spent a combined 60 years in prison. The men \xe2\x80\x94 Robert Hill, Alvena Jennette and Darryl Austin \xe2\x80\x94 were each convicted of murders in cases handled by Louis Scarcella, a Brooklyn homicide detective whose tactics are now 'b'under review'b' by Kenneth Thompson, the Brooklyn district attorney. Their convictions were 'b'vacated'b' in May after prosecutors admitted that a witness Mr. Scarcella repeatedly used was unreliable. (Last year, Mr. Stringer paid $6.4 million to David Ranta, who was freed in 2013 after serving 23 years on a wrongful murder conviction, also involving Mr. Scarcella.)'b'Compensating those who have been wrongfully convicted is not just about correcting a manifest injustice. People who come out of prison after many years face all kinds of obstacles to rebuilding their lives.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s true for Mr. Hill and Mr. Jennette, half-brothers who live together and struggle to find jobs, according to their lawyer. Mr. Austin died in prison in 2000.'b'Thirty states, the federal government and the District of Columbia 'b'have laws'b' providing for compensation to the wrongfully convicted \xe2\x80\x94 'b'from $5,000 per year'b' in Wisconsin to $80,000 per year in Texas. But, over all, 'b'almost a third'b' of those exonerated get nothing. And those who get something often must 'b'jump through multiple hoops'b', like demonstrating they are innocent or showing intentional misconduct by the police or prosecutors.'b'Under New York\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'compensation law'b', a judge determines the amount of money to be paid, a process that can take years to complete, as can federal civil-rights lawsuits like the ones these men were considering bringing against the city. While the payouts offered by Mr. Stringer were in part an effort to avoid costly litigation, and thus are significantly lower than what these men 'b'might have won'b' in court, they have the benefit of being swift and certain.'b'That is especially important to exonerees who may need prompt help in adjusting to the outside world and who do not receive the same critical re-entry services like job training and substance-abuse treatment that parolees get. Going forward, New York and other states should provide such critical services to the wrongfully convicted immediately upon their release.'b'Nearly every day, there is another story of a man or woman walking out of prison after years of wrongful incarceration, whether because of newly uncovered DNA evidence, a mistaken identification or a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct. It would be nice to think that officials entrusted with the power to put people behind bars will always do the right thing, but it helps when real money is on the line.'b'NEW DELHI \xe2\x80\x94 There are two key requirements for a truly representative democracy: First, that anyone of good character can run for election, without regard to income, gender or social status; and second, that voters determine which qualities are most important in those they elect.'b'The Indian state of Rajasthan has struck a blow against both of these freedoms. Last month, the governor issued an executive order barring citizens with less than eight years of formal education from running for election for village council head. The rationale was to create more effective and less corrupt administrations. The effect, however, will be to disempower the historically disadvantaged \xe2\x80\x94 women and the poor. Upward of half the state\xe2\x80\x99s adult male population and three-quarters of its adult female population have been disqualified from running in the elections that begin this week.'b'There are some 250,000 village councils, or Gram Panchayats, in 'b'India'b'. Elections are held every five years, and voter turnout regularly surpasses that in state and national elections. The demographic makeup of those elected is also more diverse, in large part a result of the constitutional requirement that a certain fraction of council head positions, or Pradhans, be reserved for women, lower castes and tribal groups. As of 2009, only 11 percent of India\xe2\x80\x99s national legislators were women, compared with 40 percent of village council heads.'b'The councils choose which public goods to invest in \xe2\x80\x94 from drinking-water facilities to roads \xe2\x80\x94 and where to put them. They implement welfare schemes and public jobs programs, and decide who will benefit. Over the last decade, as India has expanded its social safety net and increased investments in rural infrastructure, the financial stakes of village elections have risen. The politicians behind the education requirement have argued that less educated leaders failed to be effective administrators and were less able to resist corruption and negotiate with district officials.'b'There is some evidence that supports this position. However, it may also reflect a less enlightened agenda. The election of villagers from historically disadvantaged groups poses a major challenge to the traditional elite, who are used to controlling council resources.'b'The recent order is only the latest example of Rajasthan\xe2\x80\x99s limiting voters\xe2\x80\x99 choices. Earlier in December, the governor issued another ordinance requiring candidates to have a functional toilet, effectively eliminating many of the poor. And unfortunately, other states tend to follow Rajasthan\xe2\x80\x99s example. Back in 1992, it became the first state to require that candidates for village council positions have no more than two children \xe2\x80\x94 a rule that particularly hurts lower castes and tribal groups, where fertility rates are highest. Since then, 10 other states have passed fertility limits on local leaders (though four have since revoked the law). A recent paper found that these limits increased the incidence of sex-selective abortions, and a qualitative study in Northern India from 2005 reported that men got around the law by disowning later-born children and occasionally deserting their wives.'b'Rajasthan has a terrible record on women\xe2\x80\x99s education and female empowerment. The state has the country\xe2\x80\x99s second-lowest female literacy rate: 52 percent. And it has some of the most skewed child sex ratios, as a result of sex-selective abortion and reduced parental investment in daughters. According to the 2011 census, there were 883 girls for every 1,000 boys under age 6.'b'Village councils headed by women can catalyze change. In research published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics in 2009 and in Science magazine in 2012, my colleagues and I showed that living in a village that had elected a female leader caused villagers to report lower bias against female leaders. By creating empowered female role models, it led villagers to state more equal aspirations for their teenage sons and daughters and to reduce their daughters\xe2\x80\x99 domestic chores and increase their schooling.'b'In 2010, my colleagues and I surveyed newly elected village chiefs in 247 village councils, in regions where women have historically faced significant discrimination. Our sample included 34 women who had defeated male candidates for the council head position. These women, who had successfully challenged the traditional village male elite, were the aspirational symbols for new India. But this year, 82 percent of them have been disqualified from running.'b'The governor\xe2\x80\x99s order won\xe2\x80\x99t hurt only women who want to run for office; it will have negative consequences for all women living in these villages.'b'The governor issued the education requirement when the state legislature was out of session. As a result, it is open to a legal challenge, and a case is being heard in the state\xe2\x80\x99s High Court. Unfortunately, any change will most likely come too late for this election.'b'Education is, of course, vital. In surveys, including ones we conducted in Rajasthan in 2010, voters consistently report a strong preference for educated leaders. Requiring a benchmark for education, however, will discriminate against able leaders who have been denied schooling because of gender, poverty or caste, and who have nevertheless worked to educate themselves.'b'There are better ways of ensuring that elected politicians are competent and effective. In the month before the 2010 election, we worked with a local nonprofit group in Rajasthan on a voter awareness campaign involving theater shows and the distribution of posters and calendars. The campaign caused more literate villagers to enter the fray as candidates, and these candidates gained a higher fraction of the vote. And if the state government is truly worried about the increasing administrative demands on council heads, it could simply provide them with better support.'b'Voters, not distant state officials, are likely to make the best choices as to who will most effectively represent them. A de facto handing over of local political control to the better off will not help solve Rajasthan\xe2\x80\x99s gap between rich and poor, or stark gender inequality.'b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94 About four years ago, a friend invited me to lunch with some cartoonists from Charlie Hebdo, the French satirical newspaper. Charlie was looking for new writers. I was looking for work.'b'To prepare for the meeting, I read Charlie Hebdo. I hardly knew what to make of it. It was one of those French things, like the shops that sell nothing but taxidermied animals, that have no American equivalent. Charlie Hebdo\xe2\x80\x99s pages of cartoons \xe2\x80\x94 typically about religion, sex, politics or some combination of the three \xe2\x80\x94 came from a strain of Frenchness I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand.'b'At the lunch, I also didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of the three editors: St\xc3\xa9phane Charbonnier, Jean Cabut and Laurent Sourisseau. They were grown men who went by strange nicknames \xe2\x80\x94 Charb, Cabu and Riss \xe2\x80\x94 and had the aura of local legends. Practically everything they said seemed like an inside joke that made the others chuckle.'b'The three men listened politely as I pitched them story ideas in my pockmarked French. One, I think it was Cabut, drew me a sweet cartoon; it was his way of connecting. But they were members of a French fraternity whose references eluded me. We parted with smiles, and never spoke again.'b'Last week, after gunmen killed 10 people at Charlie Hebdo\xe2\x80\x99s weekly news meeting, I spoke to the friend who had organized that meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cTwo of the three people with whom you had lunch are dead,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. (Riss was shot in the shoulder, but survived.)'b'France can sometimes seem bafflingly foreign, but the past week has made me understand Charlie Hebdo, and the country, better. It also shocked me into a sense of belonging. Like many expatriates, I experienced the attacks not as an outsider observing France, but as a Parisian and a parent.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s partly because, in the confusion of events last week, the locals didn\xe2\x80\x99t know any more than we foreigners did. For once, we were all equally disoriented.'b'And events were unfolding so close by. Charlie Hebdo\xe2\x80\x99s offices are a 10-minute walk from my apartment. The night of the shooting, there was a kind of macabre competition among expats on Facebook to see who\xe2\x80\x99d been closest to it. The winner was an Alabamian who had walked her daughter to dance class on the same sidewalk where, just before, a policeman was shot dead.'b'It also helped that Paris suddenly became friendlier. Parents smiled at one another at our school drop-offs. A waiter at my local cafe seemed elated to see me. My downstairs neighbor, who usually approached me only to complain about noise, attempted to hug me (I converted this to a handshake).'b'We all struggled to control the narrative for our kids. Mine could hear police cars from their schoolyard. On Friday, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to mention the hostage crisis unfolding in Vincennes, a few miles away. But when I picked up my daughter from school, she immediately asked: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening at Vincennes?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She was clutching a copy of Le Petit Quotidien, a French newspaper for 6- to 10-year-olds, with the headline \xe2\x80\x9cJournalists in Danger.\xe2\x80\x9d She asked whether I was in danger, too. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s starting to get stressful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Then, when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer my phone, one of my 6-year-olds told my husband I might be dead.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you think that?\xe2\x80\x9d my husband asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'His twin brother said a classmate had taught him how to stop bad guys: You point at the ceiling, say \xe2\x80\x9clook at the bird,\xe2\x80\x9d and then when the man looks up, you rush in and kick him. He spent part of Saturday chasing another friend around our apartment, while one of them shouted \xe2\x80\x9cCharlie!\xe2\x80\x9d and the other said, \xe2\x80\x9cJe vais te massacrer\xe2\x80\x9d (I\xe2\x80\x99m going to massacre you).'b'For some parents in France, talking about events was even more complicated. Akram Belkaid, an Algerian-born journalist who has lived in Paris for 20 years, told me that when he heard about any kind of violence, his first response was always, please don\xe2\x80\x99t let the perpetrator be Muslim.'b'Last week, after he\xe2\x80\x99d convinced his terrified 11-year-old son that there wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be another attack, he also advised him how to handle questions about Islam from schoolmates.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI told him, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re not the defender of Islam. It\xe2\x80\x99s not your job to defend the religion. You are just yourself. You can just say, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t Islam, and that you\xe2\x80\x99re shocked, and that you\xe2\x80\x99re against what happened."\xe2\x80\x99'b'Belkaid wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a fan of Charlie Hebdo. So like most people in France, he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t buy it. It turns out that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t alone in being left cold by the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s bawdy cartoons. Even my friend who set up the lunch told me this week that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t always his cup of tea either, but that he admired the principle of free speech behind it.'b'I get that principle now, too. I always knew the French had a penchant for criticism and abstract thought. Usually, that just meant they complained a lot. Last week, when I saw the crowds chanting \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of expression\xe2\x80\x9d in the streets, I realized how deeply they prize the right to critique absolutely anything. When Charlie Hebdo was attacked, they immediately grasped what was at stake.'b'Though we live along the protest route in Paris, I\xe2\x80\x99d never marched for anything. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always watched from the sidelines. But on Sunday, my daughter made a sign that said \xe2\x80\x9cFreedom of expressions\xe2\x80\x9d and we headed outside. I was just another face in the Parisian crowd. And for the first time ever, that felt exactly right.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s being called the most significant election in 'b'Sri Lanka'b' in decades. On Jan. 8, voters gave a surprise victory to the opposition candidate for president, Maithripala Sirisena, and rejected the authoritarianism, corruption and dynastic ambitions of the incumbent, Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is to Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s great credit that, as soon as the people\xe2\x80\x99s verdict was clear, he graciously acknowledged defeat.'b'Mr. Sirisena has his work cut out for him. His biggest challenge will be to keep the diverse ethnic, religious and political coalition that voted for him from fracturing as he tries to reconcile the Sinhalese Buddhist majority with aggrieved Muslim and Tamil minorities. His pledge to hold parliamentary elections within 100 days will be a good step in this direction.

SWARTZ'b'\nNew York, Jan. 14, 2015'b''b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 WE live in an era of unusual political polarization, but the polarization isn\xe2\x80\x99t simply between the two parties; there are also splits within them.'b'Last week the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s divisions were on display, when Speaker of the House John A. Boehner \xe2\x80\x94 who helped his party gain its largest majority since the Truman administration \xe2\x80\x94 faced an uprising. The revolt was led by conservatives against a man whose voting record is unquestionably conservative. It was another indication that the tension on the right these days is not about policy or ideology but tone and temperament.'b'Mr. Boehner is hardly a perfect leader, but what got him into trouble was less a failure to lead than a failure to fight. The Republican Party is more uniformly conservative than ever. What some on the right are insisting on from Republican leaders, but not getting, is greater confrontation, more strident rhetoric and legislative brinkmanship. Hence the unhappiness.'b'What informs these demands is an apocalyptic view of American life during the Obama era. America is \xe2\x80\x9cvery much like Nazi Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of Ben Carson, a Tea Party favorite. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas said we had a couple of years to turn this country around or \xe2\x80\x9cwe go off the cliff to oblivion.\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Levin, a popular radio talk show host, warned that Republicans were \xe2\x80\x9cendorsing tyranny\xe2\x80\x9d if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t support shutting down the government in 2013.'b'Those of us who are conservative and deeply concerned about the damage inflicted on the country by the president but don\xe2\x80\x99t share this doom-laden view are labeled by some on the right as cowardly and unprincipled. Which raises a significant political and philosophical issue: Is there a conservative disposition? The answer, I think, is that there is, and what I\xe2\x80\x99ve just described is not it.'b'What often masquerades as conservatism these days is really populism. There is room for populism within conservatism, but it should not define conservatism. In fact, it is often in conflict with it.'b'Conservatism, for starters, is rooted in human experience. It appreciates the complexity of human society. It believes in a givenness to human nature and in enduring principles, yet it has the capacity to apply those principles to changing circumstances. And because it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a rigid ideology, it leaves itself open to self-examination and self-correction. Authentic conservatism has a high regard for things empirical, for facts that can lead us to better apprehend the truth.'b'Conservatism is famously anti-utopian, understanding life\xe2\x80\x99s imperfections and the limitations of politics. Knowing this, those on the right shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t become enraged or forlorn when the world itself doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fully conform to their hopes. Conservatism considers one of the cardinal virtues to be prudence. And no conservative \xe2\x80\x94 certainly no one familiar with the magnificent history of the Constitution \xe2\x80\x94 should be opposed to compromise per se. Whether or not accommodation is wise depends on whether an agreement nudges things in the right direction.'b'This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that conservatives shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight passionately for liberty and justice. Today\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans, for example, should advance a policy agenda that systematically transforms welfare-state programs into a market-friendly safety net. Nor does it mean that conservatism is merely a disposition, unconnected to a political theory. It simply means that conservatives should make their case with an urgency balanced by practical wisdom, equanimity and a sense of proportion. Their passion should also be balanced by gratitude.'b'In a marvelous 1976 essay, the historian Gertrude Himmelfarb contended that the key word to describe the conservative disposition was \xe2\x80\x9cenjoyment.\xe2\x80\x9d Unlike those who are \xe2\x80\x9calways lusting after something that is not,\xe2\x80\x9d the conservative tends to find delight in the achievements and blessings we have.'b'This matters because disposition is not incidental to politics; it is central to it. Voters rightly base their judgments on more than how politicians check the boxes on policy positions. What also matters is the cast of mind of public officials, their sensibilities and temperament.'b'One\xe2\x80\x99s disposition speaks to something far deeper than merely tone and style. It influences when and how we act, including the fights (or deals) we are drawn to or away from. It determines not just what our priorities are but how we interpret the world. Our lives, then, are determined in large part by our intellectual and psychological predispositions. Think of the difference in attitude between the resentfulness of Richard Nixon and the sunny optimism of Ronald Reagan. One had an enemies list while the other told his aides, \xe2\x80\x9cRemember, we have no enemies, only opponents.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fairly or not, there are some widespread negative impressions of the Republican Party: opposed to change, too extreme and inflexible, unwilling to compromise. Which is why Republicans, in selecting a presidential nominee, should choose someone with a conservative disposition, who is seen as a reassuring agent of change, and who can persuade voters rather than hector them.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a good rule of thumb for politics: The stronger one\xe2\x80\x99s philosophical convictions are, the more important temperamental moderation is. Magnanimity, winsomeness and grace aren\xe2\x80\x99t antithetical to conservatism. They are an essential part of it.'b'ELI LILLY charges more than $13,000 a month for Cyramza, the newest drug to treat 'b'stomach cancer'b'. The latest medicine for lung 'b'cancer'b', Novartis\xe2\x80\x99s Zykadia, costs almost $14,000 a month. Amgen\xe2\x80\x99s Blincyto, for leukemia, will cost $64,000 a month.'b'Why? Drug manufacturers blame high prices on the complexity of biology, government regulations and shareholder expectations for high profit margins. In other words, they say, they are hamstrung. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a simpler explanation.'b'Companies are taking advantage of a mix of laws that force insurers to include essentially all expensive drugs in their policies, and a philosophy that demands that every new health care product be available to everyone, no matter how little it helps or how much it costs. Anything else and we\xe2\x80\x99re talking death panels.'b'Examples of companies exploiting these fault lines abound. An article in 'b'The New England Journal of Medicine'b' last fall focused on how companies buy up the rights to old, inexpensive generic drugs, lock out competitors and raise prices. For instance, albendazole, a drug for certain kinds of parasitic infection, was approved back in 1996. As recently as 2010, its average wholesale cost was $5.92 per day. By 2013, it had risen to $119.58.'b'Novartis, the company that makes the leukemia drug Gleevec, keeps raising the drug\xe2\x80\x99s price, even though the drug has already delivered billions in profit to the company. In 2001 Novartis charged $4,540, in 2014 dollars, for a month of treatment; now it charges $8,488. In its pricing, Novartis is just keeping up with other companies as they charge 'b'more and more'b' for their drugs. They know we can\xe2\x80\x99t say no.'b'But what if we didn\xe2\x80\x99t require insurance companies to cover all drugs? We can see the answer in Europe. Many European countries say no to a handful of drugs each year, usually those that are both pretty ineffective and highly costly. Because they can say no, yes is not a guarantee. So companies have to offer their drugs at prices that make them attractive to these health care systems. A recent survey of cancer drug policies revealed you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to say no very often to get discounts for saying yes. Of the 29 major cancer drugs included in the study that are available in the United States, an estimated 97 percent and 86 percent are also available in Germany and France, respectively.'b'As a consequence of the stand taken by those countries, prices in Europe for prescription drugs are 50 percent below what we pay, according to a McKinsey study from 2008. Gleevec costs $4,500 per month in Germany today, and $3,300 per month in France, less than what Americans paid in 2001.'b'Saying no, or even the threat, works to lower prices in the United States, too. But it\xe2\x80\x99s rare. 'b'In 2012'b', my hospital said we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give the 'b'colon cancer'b' drug Zaltrap to our patients because it cost twice as much as another drug (Genentech\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Avastin'b') that was just as good. When we refused to use it, the company realized that other cancer hospitals and doctors might follow, and halved its price nationwide.'b'More recently, Express Scripts, a company that manages pharmacy benefits, showed that approval was no guarantee. It was therefore able to 'b'play'b' two makers of treatments for 'b'hepatitis C'b' off against each other. Express Scripts said yes to AbbVie\xe2\x80\x99s Viekira Pak (for the most common subtype, genotype 1 disease), and said no to Gilead\xe2\x80\x99s Sovaldi and Harvoni. Another pharmacy benefit program, CVS Caremark, played it the other way, closing out AbbVie and choosing Gilead.'b'Either way, the lesson is that Express Scripts, once it showed it could say no, got AbbVie to discount its product. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t saying how much, but Steve Miller, a senior executive, said it had \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly narrowed the gap between prices charged in the United States and Western Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d Sounds like the kind of progress we need.'b'You might worry about patients being harmed through these moves. But we rejected Zaltrap knowing it was no better than the alternative. Express Scripts and CVS Caremark played the two drug manufacturers off against each other because both manufacture effective treatments.'b'The industry might argue that drug spending is only 10 percent of all health care spending, but that 10 percent equals around $300 billion per year. More important, the costs of high-priced drugs are being passed on to patients. Lilly\xe2\x80\x99s drug Cyramza will cost the average 'b'Medicare'b' patient $2,600 per month without supplemental insurance. That\xe2\x80\x99s more than most Medicare-age people earn each month, before taxes. Actually, high prices get passed on to us all, either through individual costs or insurance.'b'That leaves us with two options. We can free insurers and government programs from the requirement to include all expensive drugs in their plans as we explain to the public that some drugs are not effective enough to justify their price. If we do this, we can be confident that manufacturers will lower their prices to ensure their ability to sell their products. Or we can piggyback on the gumption of bolder countries, and demand that policy makers set drug prices in the United States equal to those of Western Europe. Either approach would be vastly superior to the situation we have today.'b'Another video in another police shooting emerged this week \xe2\x80\x94 and it shows yet another case that demands empathy, and an understanding of the fraught moments that can lead to such an outcome, and the complexity of the legal process that follows.'b''b'The video showed'b' an officer in Montana shooting and killing a passenger in a car at a traffic stop in a \xe2\x80\x9chigh crime\xe2\x80\x9d area of Billings.'b'The dashcam video shows the young police officer, Grant Morrison, approaching the passenger side of the car and immediately saying:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHands up. All four of you, hands up. What were you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then Morrison asks one of the occupants his name. \xe2\x80\x9cRichard,\xe2\x80\x9d a voice can be heard to reply.'b'Morrison repeats his command that everyone put their hands up or else he\xe2\x80\x99s going to shoot. He draws his gun, and fires three shots into the car, and again yells, \xe2\x80\x9cHands up! Hands up!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(The actions of the people in the car are obscured on the video.)'b'Richard Ramirez is shot. His lung is punctured.'b'The encounter lasts about 30 seconds.'b'Morrison sobs after the shooting, at the scene, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought he was going to pull a gun on me.\xe2\x80\x9d As Morrison leans on the hood of a police cruiser, another officer seeks to comfort him, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe he was. Maybe he was.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ramirez was high on methamphetamine, but unarmed.'b'There is a coroner\xe2\x80\x99s inquest with a jury.'b'Morrison reportedly says of when he shot Ramirez, \xe2\x80\x9cI knew in that moment, which later was determined to be untrue, but I knew in that moment that he was reaching for a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d He continues, \xe2\x80\x9cI couldn\xe2\x80\x99t take that risk. ... I wanted to see my son grow up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The jury clears Morrison of wrongdoing.'b'Ramirez\xe2\x80\x99s family was not happy. 'b'As CBS News reported'b': \xe2\x80\x9cRamirez\xe2\x80\x99s family wanted criminal charges against the officer and said Ramirez was a victim of racial profiling.\xe2\x80\x9d Morrison is white, Ramirez was \xe2\x80\x9chalf-Mexican.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By the way, this was not the first time in Morrison\xe2\x80\x99s five-year career that he had shot and killed an unarmed man who was high on methamphetamine and who failed to comply with his instructions. In February of 2013, Morrison shot and killed Jason James Shaw. In that case, another officer testified that Morrison said, \xe2\x80\x9cI know you have a gun!\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI will shoot you.\xe2\x80\x9d Morrison was also cleared by a jury of wrongdoing in that killing.'b'This case is an example of how complicated police interaction can be, and it raises many questions that the police and the public must wrestle with as the country debates policing practices, crime, appropriate use of force and the impact on minority communities.'b'First, and this cannot be said often enough, police officers do dangerous work that few of us would sign up to do. When the job is done well, it keeps communities safe and society civil. But the way that is accomplished is that the officers must encounter a disproportionate number of people who break the law, and we must ask to what degree that skew \xe2\x80\x94 the types of people they encounter \xe2\x80\x94 warps their perception of citizens in general.'b'If you overwhelmingly see the bad in people, does it diminish your impulse to search for the good? And if part of your job is to patrol \xe2\x80\x9chigh crime\xe2\x80\x9d areas, are you predisposed to lump in some non-criminals with the actual criminals in those areas? Furthermore, are your fears heightened and is your trigger finger made more itchy in those areas because you are more worried about making it home to your family than about the person you encounter making it home to theirs?'b'Another line of questioning we must explore involves appropriate use of force. Both men shot and killed by Morrison had taken drugs, but that is not a capital offense in a court of law, if you make it alive to a court of law. Both, reportedly, did not properly comply with police instructions \xe2\x80\x94 possibly because of the drug use \xe2\x80\x94 but that, too, is not a capital offense, assuming that you make it alive to a courtroom. Is there a better, more responsible approach to noncompliance than the use of deadly force?'b'(In the case of Shaw, a stun gun was used first, but a heavy jacket reportedly blunted the effect.)'b'And why should police officers so often worry about the presence of a gun anyway? This is a question we have to ask ourselves as a nation in love with our firearms. In 2013, 'b'Illinois became the last state 'b' to allow the concealed carry of firearms. Not that criminals, by definition, care much about laws anyway, but now even more people can legally have concealed guns on them. That has to raise the anxiety of police officers. Furthermore, as the Pew Research Center found last month: \xe2\x80\x9cFor the first time in more than two decades of Pew Research Center surveys, there is more support for gun rights than gun control.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is also the question of whether bias and profiling play a role in officers\xe2\x80\x99 propensity to use deadly force, as Ramirez\xe2\x80\x99s family suggest. There is some conflict here. Studies using simulations in 2002 and 2005 showed that people were more likely to shoot unarmed black men, while, in the case of the latter study, letting armed white people slip by. On the other hand, a study published last year found that participants \xe2\x80\x9cwere more likely to feel threatened in scenarios involving black people. But when it came time to shoot, participants were biased in favor of black suspects, taking longer to pull the trigger against them than against armed white or Hispanic suspects.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These are not apples-to-apples studies, and the scenarios don\xe2\x80\x99t neatly align with the Morrison shootings, but it is worth considering that the science around the issue does not make for simple talking points.'b'Then there is the issue of who gets the benefit of the doubt in police shootings. As 'b'The New York Times pointed out in December'b', grand jury indictment of police officers in deadly forces cases was rare, saying \xe2\x80\x9cthe justice system can favor the police, often shielding them from murder or serious manslaughter charges.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the end, this is again about fears, what informs and activates fears, the actions police officers take \xe2\x80\x94 reasonable or not \xe2\x80\x94 in response to those fears, and whether jurors generally find the officers\xe2\x80\x99 fears justified.'b'The men Morrison killed should not have used drugs and should have quickly complied with his commands. Should there have been some punishment for that? Yes. Should that punishment have been death? Absolutely not.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Veteran\xe2\x80\x99s Campaign Would Rein In Disability Pay'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 8):'b'Lt. Col.

Libyan extremists blew up a Foreign Ministry building last month because an official wished people \xe2\x80\x9cMerry Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These spasms of terrorism cry out for a conversation among Muslims about faith and tolerance. Islamic reformers could point out that the Koran prescribes 'b'no punishment'b' at all for 'b'blasphemers'b' besides telling others to keep their distance from them. The holy book that decrees death for blasphemy is the Bible (Leviticus 24:16).'b'Fortunately, a Saudi liberal, Raif Badawi, has kick-started a public 'b'discussion'b' about Islam and modernity on his blog. Good for Saudi Arabia for promoting this kind of debate!'b'Well, no. Actually, our Saudi allies sentenced Badawi to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for \xe2\x80\x9cinsulting Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d The first 50 lashes were delivered in a public flogging on Friday, and Badawi is scheduled to receive 50 more every Friday until he reaches 1,000.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRaif raised his head toward the sky, closing his eyes and arching his back," Amnesty International quoted a 'b'witness'b' as saying.'b'There is a difference between murdering cartoonists and flogging bloggers. But still!'b'Saudi Arabia could play a leadership role in Islam. In the mid-20th century, King Abdul Aziz\xc2\xa0al-Saud overcame traditionalists who opposed cars, radio and the telegraph as non-Islamic by having'b' the Koran read aloud 'b'on the radio.'b'Yet since then Saudi elites have retreated, sipping whiskey at private parties while deferring publicly to the traditionalists. Saudi Arabia does not allow Christian churches and sometimes has confiscated Bibles. (I once smuggled in a Bible to see what would happen if I were caught; Saudi customs officials searched the wrong bag.) The kingdom oppresses Shiites, funds extremist Wahhabi madrasas across the Islamic world and last month referred two women to its antiterrorism courts \xe2\x80\x94 for 'b'driving'b' cars.'b'To be blunt, Saudi Arabia legitimizes Islamic fundamentalism and intolerance.'b'Pakistani officials play a similar game. Pakistan was once a tolerant country whose first foreign minister was a member of the Ahmadi sect. Now Ahmadis are persecuted, and a Christian woman, Asia Bibi, is on death row in a preposterous blasphemy case after drinking water said to be for Muslims only.'b'(Bravo to 'b'Dawn'b', a Pakistani newspaper, for daring to publish online an article this week by Arafat Mazhar using Islamic legal reasoning to protest the 'b'sentence against Asia Bibi'b'. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we need more of.)'b'One risk is that the West will respond to Islamic terror with Islamophobia and intolerance that aggravate religious tensions \xe2\x80\x94 just what the terrorists hope to provoke. The French nationalist Marine Le Pen has 'b'gained ground'b', and we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen 'b'suggestions from Rupert Murdoch'b' and others that all 1.6 billion Muslims are somehow to blame for Islamic terrorism. After I wrote last week that the world should resist that impulse to smear all Muslims, I was 'b'denounced'b' by Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly and Sean Hannity on Fox News and called an \xe2\x80\x9c'b'ink-stained coward'b'\xe2\x80\x9d by The Weekly Standard.'b'Hmm. When Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly apologizes for I.R.A. bombings and the genocide by Christian Serbs, then Muslims will no doubt apologize for Paris.'b'Maybe if these \xe2\x80\x9cjournalists\xe2\x80\x9d left their bubble and actually talked to more Muslims, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t spew nonsense \xe2\x80\x94 such as that 'b'Pakistan is an Arab country'b' or that Birmingham, England, is entirely Muslim and a no-go area for Christians. That paranoid claim by a Fox News \xe2\x80\x9cexpert,\xe2\x80\x9d later retracted, led wags to suggest that the city had renamed itself 'b'Birming'b', since Muslims avoid ham.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s resist simplistic narratives on our side, for they\xe2\x80\x99ve already done enough damage in the Islamic world, and in truth Islam is as complex and diverse as, say, \xe2\x80\x9cjournalism.\xe2\x80\x9d Muslims include the terrorist who murdered Jews in Paris and the Malian worker there who risked his life to 'b'save seven Jews'b'.'b'In the past our overreaction to Islamism has sometimes been counterproductive: The Bush administration was so fearful of the Islamic Courts Union government in Somalia that it was complicit in an Ethiopian invasion in 2006 that led to the rise of the terrorist Al Shabab militia there. We were all left less secure.'b'Republicans have been hounding President Obama for not sending a top official to Paris. They\xe2\x80\x99re right. But let\xe2\x80\x99s engage in more than symbolism and actually support the moderates in the Islamic world who are pushing for change \xe2\x80\x94 and, sometimes, being flogged for it.

Or college dropouts.'b'Wow, we\xe2\x80\x99ve only been together for a few seconds and already I sense a strong preference for college dropouts. Lucky I didn\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s talk about governors. Or cats.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A number of our governors are currently nursing presidential ambitions. Why not? They have experience running things and dealing with cranky legislators. Also, they look at the herd of presidential hopefuls and think, \xe2\x80\x9cClearly, I could do better.\xe2\x80\x9d This is true of every elected official down to and including members of the zoning board of appeals, but we tend to take governors more seriously.'b'The most brazen prospective candidate, Chris Christie, prepared for his State of the State speech this week with a special off-the-record press conference to which only national journalists were invited. Honest \xe2\x80\x94 he barred the state reporters from his discussion of the state of the state. Maybe the governor was afraid they\xe2\x80\x99d distract him with small-bore questions about New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s eight credit downgrades.'b'Then it was on to the speech, during which Christie talked about America\xe2\x80\x99s world leadership (\xe2\x80\x9ccalled into question\xe2\x80\x9d) and the state of the nation (\xe2\x80\x9cbeset by anxiety\xe2\x80\x9d). And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that last part, he had a story about a little old lady he met in Florida.'b'Meanwhile, Gov. Mike Pence stuck pretty much to Indiana. ...'b'Whoops, I feel you drifting away at the words \xe2\x80\x9cMike Pence.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, he appears to have presidential ambitions as well. Plus two cats named Pickle and Oreo.'b'Now that I\xe2\x80\x99ve regained your attention, let\xe2\x80\x99s consider Scott Walker, the governor of Wisconsin. Walker really, really wants to run for president. His State of the State speech was about opposing terrorism and shrinking the government, plus 10 billion mentions of the Green Bay Packers. He\xe2\x80\x99s already hired a political consultant for his run. The consultant\xe2\x80\x99s claim to fame is having helped oversee the presidential campaign of Rudy Giuliani, but nobody\xe2\x80\x99s perfect.'b'If Walker was elected, he\xe2\x80\x99d be the first president without a college degree since Harry Truman. Yes! This is the college dropout connection. How important do you think it is for a president to have a college degree? If Walker gets traction, I am looking forward to digging into this a lot. Perhaps it will give me a chance to explain why William Henry Harrison quit medical school in 1791.'b'Walker went to Marquette University in Milwaukee. I went to Marquette, too. Had a great time. Unlike Walker, I got a degree. Only one of us is a governor, so there\xe2\x80\x99s a point for the dropouts right there.'b'His early departure may have had something to do with disappointment over an unsuccessful career in campus politics. Or just not being very into school. Apparently, Walker was a mediocre student. By the way, how much do we care about presidential prospects\xe2\x80\x99 college grades? Not much \xe2\x80\x94 these are middle-aged people, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. Actually, we just need to be sure that if the grades were bad, the candidate has gotten over it.'b'John Kerry\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaign in 2004 was hobbled by outrageous attacks on his war record, which Kerry might have been able to bury by releasing all his Navy records. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, until long after the race was over. Then reporters discovered that everything about his military career was exactly as Kerry had portrayed it. The only news was in his college transcript, which was included in the file and pretty dismal. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wondered if the entire course of modern American history would have turned out different if John Kerry had not wanted to conceal the fact that his academic performance at Yale was worse than George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'As far as quitting school goes, Walker left during his senior year to take a marketing job with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem totally unreasonable. He obviously wasn\xe2\x80\x99t into school. And in many lines of work, it\xe2\x80\x99s only the job history that matters.'b'However, we want to make sure that when students of the future are making decisions like this, they\xe2\x80\x99re grounded in reality. Walker claimed that he was about to get the rest of his credits while he was working, but then he got married. (Actually, as PolitiFact Wisconsin reported in a stupendously thorough investigation of this matter, he had several years of potential night school time before he wed.) Then he was going to go, but he was county executive and too busy. And it keeps going on.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe in the next few years,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters in 2013.'b'This is a bad sign. I think I speak for all of us when I say we do not want to hear any arguments that we should elect Walker president so he\xe2\x80\x99ll have time to finish his senior year credits.'b'But at least he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hug the Dallas Cowboys\xe2\x80\x99 owner.'b'In the abstract, 'b'President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal'b' for making community college tuition-free seems a reasonable response to a troublesome fact: The American work force is less educated than it needs to be at a time when most jobs in the new economy will require some college education. But for such an idea to work, states and localities that have been starving community colleges for decades will need to begin holding them to higher standards and commit to sustained financing instead of using the new federal money to dodge their own financial obligations.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal deserves to be taken seriously by the public, state legislatures, municipal authorities and, of course, Congress, which will be asked to underwrite it. Although many details have yet to be worked out, the preliminary plans released last week call for an estimated $60 billion in new spending over 10 years to help cover tuition and fees for full-time and half-time students who maintain a 2.5 grade point average \xe2\x80\x94 about a C-plus \xe2\x80\x94 and who make consistent progress toward completion.'b'The program would help as many as nine million students and would be open to colleges that offer credit toward a four-year degree or occupational training programs that offer certificates or degrees in high-demand areas. The federal government would cover three-quarters of the average cost of community college for those students, and states that choose to participate would cover the remainder. If all states participate, the administration estimates, the program could save each full-time student an average of $3,800 a year.'b'Some argue that the program is unnecessary because community college, where tuition averages about $3,330 a year, is reasonably priced and made even more so by the federal Pell Grants available to poor and working-class students. However, tuition accounts for only about one-fifth of the costs of attending a community college. These costs \xe2\x80\x94 as defined by the federal guidelines \xe2\x80\x94 include housing, food, books, transportation and other expenses. These are often insurmountable expenses for community college students \xe2\x80\x94 about one in three come from families with annual incomes below $20,000. Students, many of them struggling academically to begin with, typically try to make up the shortfall by working long hours. Their studies suffer, and they often drop out.'b'This is a particularly severe problem in urban community colleges, where the three-year graduation rate hovers around 15 percent. But, as President Obama pointed out in his announcement, efforts like the Accelerated Study in Associate Programs at the City University of New York can dramatically increase student success, as defined by graduation rates and the rate at which students move on to four-year degrees. ASAP, which began in 2007, provides money for books, coaching, tutoring, tuition waivers and transportation. Fifty-seven percent of last year\xe2\x80\x99s graduates finished in three years.'b'Despite higher upfront costs, the cost per ASAP graduate is actually lower than it is for traditional students because students in the program move through the system more quickly. One study found that for every dollar invested in ASAP, $3.50 in tax revenues and unused social service benefits was gained.'b'As rules are written for the national program, the White House and Congress must make sure that only institutions with a demonstrable commitment to helping students graduate are rewarded. States should be required to sustain significant investments in their community colleges, revise accrediting rules so that community colleges are held to higher standards and make sure that students who graduate from those colleges can easily transfer to public four-year schools.'b'The skepticism that has greeted Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal in some quarters has overtones of the skepticism that greeted 19th-century educators when they began to agitate for free, universal public high schools. Their efforts proved crucial at a time when the country was moving away from farming and toward a world in which reading, writing and reasoning would be critical. Expanded access to community college could do the same thing for the country in the information age.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a scary thought: New York State\xe2\x80\x99s politicians suddenly have an extra $5 billion to spend. Albany\xe2\x80\x99s treasury is fat with the state\xe2\x80\x99s share of fines paid by financial institutions for past misconduct. And in all but a few cases, there are no real strings attached. So the scrum has started, with virtually every politician and interest group and government entity scrambling for a share of the windfall.'b'As state lawmakers start working on a new budget next week, this bonus should not be wasted on politicians\xe2\x80\x99 pet projects. Nor should it be used for tax cuts or recurring operating expenses. Nor should it disappear into the cavernous state budget. Instead, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and legislative leaders should devote it to carefully chosen, one-time investments that help all New Yorkers. Here are a few better ideas:'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 New York needs $22 billion over the next 20 years to build better drinking-water facilities, and an additional $29.7 billion for wastewater infrastructure, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers. A drop here or there could help.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority faces a $15 billion deficit in its five-year capital plan. Even a modest transfusion could benefit the system\xe2\x80\x99s 8.7 million daily riders.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Nearly a quarter of the state\xe2\x80\x99s major roads are in poor condition, and thousands of older bridges need repairs.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Farmland could be bought or protected, especially in the upper Hudson region.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 And if Albany runs out of ideas, some of the money could be put away for leaner times.'b'The $5 billion comes from banks and insurance groups that have been fined for various transgressions \xe2\x80\x94 irresponsible peddling of mortgage-backed securities, helping Americans avoid taxes or illegally doing business with countries facing sanctions. The fines have been divided among various entities, including the federal government, with $5 billion flowing to New York.'b'That is a hefty sum. But in Albany hefty sums can disappear quickly, especially if indiscriminately applied to broad tax relief or ongoing programs. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the money should be used for focused, one-shot investments that can bring tangible relief to as many New Yorkers as possible.'b'North Korea thrust itself back into the international limelight with its recent hacking of Sony Pictures. As always, however, the gravest danger from North Korea is the threat that its unpredictable leaders could one day unleash a nuclear weapon, either in anger or by mistake.'b'With so many crises demanding the attention of President Obama and other world leaders, it is tempting, even convenient, to relegate North Korea to the back burner when it is not testing a nuclear device or a missile. Washington had done so before the Sony incident. The North has not conducted nuclear and missile tests in nearly two years, in large measure because China has been more aggressive in pressuring Pyongyang to behave by withholding vital supplies of jet fuel and heating oil.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s tactics have been a useful short-term check on the North, but they are not a durable answer to the nuclear threat, which continues to grow. North Korea poses a unique danger because it is actually trying to target the United States with nuclear weapons. Experts believe that Pyongyang probably had no nuclear weapons in January 2003 when it walked away from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Yet today the regime may have enough fissile material for as many as a 'b'dozen'b' warheads, in addition to increasingly capable missiles with which to deliver them.'b'Siegfried Hecker, a prominent North Korean specialist who has visited the country several times, wrote recently in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that the regime is becoming ever more convinced that it needs its nuclear arsenal to survive and that, as a result, the chance of ensuring the long-term goal of a Korean Peninsula without nuclear weapons is growing increasingly dim.'b'Even so, the North on Saturday made public an overture that may suggest a new willingness to engage on the nuclear issue. Ostensibly to promote dialogue on the divided peninsula, it offered to impose a 'b'temporary moratorium on nuclear tests'b' if the United States canceled its joint annual military exercises with South Korea.'b'It is easy to be skeptical, even dismissive, of such a proposal given the North\xe2\x80\x99s brutality toward its people, its history of provocations and its failure to abide by international commitments. The State Department rejected the initiative out of hand, and privately, some officials said they read it as a threat intended to give the North an excuse to carry out a nuclear test as the Americans were carrying out their military exercises.'b'In any case, the Obama administration is sticking to its policy of \xe2\x80\x9cstrategic patience\xe2\x80\x9d toward the North \xe2\x80\x94 imposing tough sanctions and refusing a new round of nuclear negotiations until the North takes steps to halt its program \xe2\x80\x94 and even ratcheting it up. On Jan. 2, it imposed 'b'new sanctions'b' on the North in retaliation for the Sony hacking that can be used in the future to increase pressure on the nuclear and missile programs.'b'Several American analysts on North Korea outside the administration viewed the new North Korean proposal as a serious one deserving of a serious response. While the North doesn\xe2\x80\x99t really expect Washington to cancel the military exercises, one analyst argued, the exercises could be modified in some way to show good will and open room for negotiation. A group of experts, including two former senior American negotiators, plans to hold unofficial talks with some North Koreans in Singapore next week to explore ways to restart negotiations on a nuclear agreement. Recent overtures by South Korea and North Korea to meet bilaterally could offer another path to engagement.'b'North Korea and its nuclear ambitions have long been a tough problem, but the world cannot acquiesce as Pyongyang builds an increasingly capable arsenal. Mr. Obama pledged to reduce nuclear proliferation worldwide, but his policy has failed to curb North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear development. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to understand what America would lose by testing the North\xe2\x80\x99s intentions once again, especially as China may be ready to be a more responsible partner in finding a solution.'b'JERUSALEM \xe2\x80\x94 At the turn of the last century, Nachman Syrkin, a young democratic socialist drawn to the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical Zionism\xe2\x80\x9d of Theodor Herzl, was a student in Berlin, a member of a discussion group of \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s from the Russian Pale of Settlement. One day, the speaker was a left-wing intellectual eager to prove that an emancipated Europe would be a home to all Jews \xe2\x80\x94 that separatist nationalisms were a mark of obsolete despair. He held up his tattered jacket. \xe2\x80\x9cLook at this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wool was taken from sheep which were pastured in Angora; it was spun in England, woven in Lodz. The buttons came from Germany; the thread from Austria\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 at which point Syrkin called out, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd the rip in the sleeve was no doubt from Kiev!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For Israel\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, last week\xe2\x80\x99s crimes in Paris were that kind of Zionist d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu, instructive for emancipated citizens and for Jews \xe2\x80\x94 often the same people, yet distinct enough from each other to learn different lessons. The enemy has changed since Syrkin\xe2\x80\x99s time but, for Mr. Netanyahu, apparently, not much else has. The Jewish response must be to self-segregate: affirm, in principle, the liberal values of the West, but deny that they ever worked well enough for diaspora Jews; insist that we fight for our freedoms from our own ground.'b'Who exactly are \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d? That question is superfluous, because anti-Semites will let us know. And their hatred, which tracks from the Roman expulsion, has migrated in this generation to \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic radicalism,\xe2\x80\x9d which must be confronted globally, and which, Mr. Netanyahu says, Israel is confronting in the form of Iran and Hamas. The French, and the whole European Union for that matter, must now, in his words, \xe2\x80\x9cwake up\xe2\x80\x9d and fight to protect \xe2\x80\x9cour common civilization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsrael stands with Europe; Europe must stand with Israel,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a speech after a meeting with Norway\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister here last week. French Jews, in contrast, must realize that \xe2\x80\x9cthe state of Israel is your home,\xe2\x80\x9d as he told them in Paris after four Jews were killed at a kosher supermarket.'b'What of France\xe2\x80\x99s republican tradition, to which marchers in Paris gave poignant tribute? Although it has struggled since its inception against ignorance, venality and primordial fear, it has not failed this generation. What of the once unimaginable standards for European integration? What of French Jews who justly feel themselves a part of French civil society and approach Jewish religious culture with emancipationist skepticism? Would they not be lost \xe2\x80\x94 upon arrival and for years \xe2\x80\x94 in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s secular Hebrew culture and under its Orthodox religious hierarchy?'b'It is hard to find an Israeli leader or media commentator who does not condescend when asked these questions, much as Mr. Netanyahu does. Even Yair Lapid, the self-described \xe2\x80\x9ccentrist\xe2\x80\x9d former finance minister who leads the youthful, hip Yesh Atid party, told an audience in Beersheba on the eve of Paris\xe2\x80\x99s unity rally that the need to fight terrorism \xe2\x80\x9cis now reaching the Europeans,\xe2\x80\x9d and that European Jewry \xe2\x80\x9cmust understand that there is just one place for Jews.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, academic experts appear on television here, lamenting what they call France\xe2\x80\x99s great disaster \xe2\x80\x94 its inability, or unwillingness, to invest in 10 percent of its population, Muslim immigrants from its former colonies in North Africa, leaving them alienated and unassimilated. Monday morning, I woke up to the Israeli radio host Arie Golan asking a guest if there is, indeed, a clash of civilizations between \xe2\x80\x9cIslam\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cChristianity and Judaism.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Golan, unabashed, was implying that Islam is a kind of toxic medium, fine if it delivers homeopathic doses, but poisonous to minds if concentrated. And what could be done to bring more French Jews to Israel, he asked the guest, the former intelligence chief Efraim Halevy. Mr. Halevy, a secular Jew, answered that the state rabbinate must immediately stop calling into question the credentials of French rabbis. Every Jew needs a rabbi, presumably.'b'Mr. Netanyahu rightly implies, if only intuitively, that the crimes against the satirists at Charlie Hebdo and the Jews at Hyper Cacher were not motivated by quite the same madness. In the first instance, the killers assassinated specific people, targeted for blasphemy, while in the second \xe2\x80\x94 more properly called terrorism \xe2\x80\x94 the killers attacked random members of an ethnic and religious category of people. What Mr. Netanyahu will not acknowledge is that the fierce republicanism the demonstrators celebrated is their hard-won response to all forms of political violence, whether against satirists or minorities \xe2\x80\x94 and always has been. Its defense is hardly something that Europeans \xe2\x80\x94 or Americans since Madison, for that matter \xe2\x80\x94 need Israeli leaders to lecture them about.'b'When it comes to Europe, Mr. Netanyahu is a lion for Jewish rights, insisting on the strictures of a republican social contract. But at home, he is cavalier about them. If French Jews did migrate en masse, what would they find in Israel? Strict civil equality that reduces the threat of political violence? Hardly. A separation of religion and state that mitigates zealotry? Ask Mr. Halevy. A Muslim Arab population that the government has assimilated with social investment and laws promoting tolerance? No and no. And this group is not 10 percent of the population; it is 20. An end to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s occupation of Palestinian territories? Mr. Netanyahu dismisses the idea as implausible. He asks, smugly, if Islamists would stop hating the West if there were no occupation. He assumes we would say no without reservation.'b'No wonder the Israeli news media has reported that President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande discreetly asked Mr. Netanyahu and the Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, not to come to Paris, fearing that the Palestinian conflict would distract from, or debase, the European show of republican unity. The reports said he particularly feared that Mr. Netanyahu would make speeches, for campaign purposes, about the Jews of France. He was not wrong to fear that.'b'Sadly, what the Netanyahu era has utterly eclipsed is a rival Zionist tradition, the century of \xe2\x80\x9ccultural Zionism\xe2\x80\x9d from the cultural and political critic Achad Ha\xe2\x80\x99am to the poet Yehuda Amichai. This Zionism would have marched more comfortably in Paris, anticipating a democratic Hebrew republic that reached emancipated Jewish hearts by transforming historic Jewish civilization into something modern and beautiful, poetic and individual \xe2\x80\x94 not by turning anti-Semitism into an excuse for Jewish exceptionalism. Chaim Weizmann, Zionism\xe2\x80\x99s world president in its pioneering days, was in Syrkin\xe2\x80\x99s group. He sought \xe2\x80\x9ccultural revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, not merely \xe2\x80\x9crescue.\xe2\x80\x9d When he became Israel\xe2\x80\x99s first president, he despised the growth of paid state clergy.'b'Had Mr. Weizmann lived to see the European Union, he would not have patronized its leaders. He would have wanted Israel to join.'b'CHICAGO \xe2\x80\x94 Friday marks the 150th anniversary of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s famous field order to confiscate 400,000 acres of land from former slave-owners and distribute it to former slaves \xe2\x80\x94 the promise of 40 acres and mule that we so often hear about.'b'In the wake of the Civil War, the United States could have provided a solid foundation for black economic development. But the government failed to follow through with General Sherman\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious land reform initiative; instead his order was repealed by President Andrew Johnson in the fall of 1865 and former slaves were drawn into various forms of peonage, which kept them in economic bondage.'b'Today, 21 years after the end of apartheid, South Africa finds itself at a moment of comparable significance. The country has a land reform program, but its implementation is in many ways undermining instead of promoting black economic development.'b'Due to colonial and apartheid-era land theft, when South Africa held its first democratic election in 1994 whites owned about 87 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s total land, although they constituted just over 10 percent of the population. The post-apartheid state has tried to address past land theft through a multifaceted land reform strategy that includes land restitution \xe2\x80\x94 a program providing compensation to individuals and communities dispossessed of land after 1913 as a result of racially discriminatory laws and practices. Although the South African government has made significant investments in land reform, the ruling African National Congress has made decisions and promoted policies that are calcifying the existing economic order rather than transforming it.'b'In the course of 150 interviews with people who received compensation through the land restitution program, it became clear that the government\xe2\x80\x99s policy is deeply flawed.'b'Of the nearly 80,000 claims filed primarily by blacks, the post-apartheid state has settled about 70 percent by distributing a Standard Settlement Offer, which is symbolic monetary compensation that is unrelated to the current or past market value of the property confiscated. Such compensation was particularly unjust for former owners like the Majolas, a black family that had owned property in Sophiatown \xe2\x80\x94 a once-vibrant, mixed-race community near downtown Johannesburg, which apartheid authorities uprooted to create a white suburb called Triumph. (We have used a pseudonym to protect the family\xe2\x80\x99s privacy.)'b'South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s land restitution authorities did not give the dispossessed residents of Sophiatown the option of receiving land in their former neighborhood or elsewhere. Instead, the state paid them a mere 40,000 rand per claim (approximately $3,500). In the case of the Majola family, the law mandated that each of the six surviving siblings receive about 6,600 rand ($570), since their deceased parents owned the home. As one family member said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a case of take the money and go type of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d Sadly, these small sums were all the Majolas and their former neighbors were offered, despite the fact that several houses in Sophiatown are currently on the market for upwards of 700,000 rand ($60,000), about 20 times the value of the compensation the siblings received.'b'Although the situation is deeply unfair for families like the Majolas, defenders of the current policy argue that the South African government has no viable alternatives because it has a limited budget and it must spend on other costly priorities like education and health. Others believe that this is the price South Africans had to pay to end apartheid without a full-scale civil war and keep the economy intact.'b'The problem is that white South Africans are receiving far more compensation than blacks.'b'When the post-apartheid state wants to put the Majolas and other dispossessed blacks back into their homes, it pays the current owners market-related compensation through voluntary exchange or by exercising eminent domain. This most often involves amounts that are several orders of magnitude higher than a typical settlement offer proposed to dispossessed blacks. For instance, this month a white farmer was paid nearly 1.5 million rand ($130,000) for 165 hectares in the northern Mpumalanga region. It is patently unfair for current owners (who are mostly white) to systematically receive higher compensation than owners dispossessed by prior governments (who are mostly black).'b'Furthermore, when the government allows current owners to keep their property, they receive a significant additional benefit. The modest payment given to families like the Majolas negates any outstanding claims to their former properties \xe2\x80\x94 effectively sanitizing the property rights of current owners by removing the stench of past land theft, but without properly compensating blacks.'b'Given the state of public opinion, this inequity could have devastating consequences for South Africa\xe2\x80\x99s future. Professor James Gibson of Washington University, St. Louis, surveyed 3,700 South Africans and found that two of every three blacks agreed with the statement: \xe2\x80\x9cLand must be returned to blacks in South Africa, no matter what the consequences are for the current owners and for political stability in the country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'South Africa may have avoided civil war during the transition to democracy two decades ago, but that does not mean the country\xe2\x80\x99s impoverished majority is content with their lot or that the risk of instability has disappeared.'b'The United States failed to institute meaningful land reform when it had the opportunity 150 years ago, and today we are living with the consequences in the form of persistent racial inequalities.'b'South Africa must not make the same mistake. The country began its second round of land restitution in June 2014; this time the government must get it right.'b'TEL AVIV \xe2\x80\x94 There is great irony to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive response to terror attacks on Jews in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 and the devastating attack last week on a kosher grocery store in Paris was no different.'b'Pack your belongings! Flee! Escape, Israel urges the Jews of France.'b'A government that never misses an opportunity to lecture the Western world about the pitfalls of surrendering to terrorism is proposing exactly that \xe2\x80\x94 surrender \xe2\x80\x94 to the Jews of France.'b'Surrender followed by immigration to Israel, where surrender is not an option.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe state of Israel is your home,\xe2\x80\x9d Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the Jews of France, refraining from blatantly saying that they ought to leave and come to Israel as Prime Minister Ariel Sharon suggested 10 years ago.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I have to advise our brothers in France,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sharon said at the time, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll tell them one thing \xe2\x80\x94 move to Israel, as early as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d President Jacques Chirac reacted furiously and declared Mr. Sharon persona non grata.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s clear why the French take offense. The call for immigration to Israel is a vote of no confidence in France\xe2\x80\x99s ability to protect its own citizens. Mr. Netanyahu was careful in packaging his message last week, but the French still didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him at Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s huge march in Paris and they only reluctantly accepted his presence.'b'Members of Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s government were, as usual, less diplomatic.'b'An Israeli deputy minister, Ofir Akunis of the Likud party, called on French Jews to \xe2\x80\x9ccome home\xe2\x80\x9d to Israel. Deputy Minister Eli Ben-Dahan of the Jewish Home party told them, \xe2\x80\x9cYour place is with us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The immigration option has become much more pronounced in recent years. Last year more than 6,000 French Jews immigrated to Israel, more than from any other country, and the potential for growth is significant.'b'They have their reasons. Anti-Semitic incidents have become a regular occurrence in France. The surge in attacks is well-documented, as is the declining sense of security of French Jews. And the French government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to know how to halt this destructive process.'b'Encouraging Jews from all countries to move to Israel is in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s DNA, and Israel could greatly benefit from an influx of French immigrants. But Israeli leaders ought to pause before calling for a mass exodus of French Jews.'b'Does the Jewish state want to actively contribute to ending many hundreds of years of French Jewish history? Does it want to convey the message that yes, as the terrorists argue, there is no place for Jews in France? Does it want to imply that French efforts to protect Jews have been a failure? Does it want the world to see fearful Jews fleeing from Europe en masse yet again?'b'France is home to a great Jewish civilization, the third-largest Jewish community in the world \xe2\x80\x94 a Jewish community in a Western, liberal country that seems to be in great trouble.'b'And we now live in a world where in recent months people have brooded unemotionally, almost nonchalantly, over the question of whether the Jews \xe2\x80\x9chave a future\xe2\x80\x9d in France.'b'If not France, where? And if not a future, what?'b'Israel believes it has the answer. Jews can flee the terror of radical Islamists in France, to find shelter in a place where the terror of radical Islamists is as routine as baguettes and Bordeaux.'b'If these Jews come to Israel and face terror, they will be urged to stay, to demonstrate to the enemy the meaning of a stiff-necked people. Israel, in the narrative that is sold to French Jews these days, is where Jews make their last stand.'b'It is heartbreaking to witness a great Jewish community in a great country slowly losing its ability to thrive in a hostile and violent environment. And it is unfortunate that all the Jewish state has to offer them is escape.'b'At the end of Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s visit to Paris, he attended a ceremony in a synagogue, where the crowd spontaneously broke into song following his remarks. But they weren\xe2\x80\x99t singing in Hebrew; they were singing France\xe2\x80\x99s national anthem, \xe2\x80\x9cLa Marseillaise.\xe2\x80\x9d One wonders what they were thinking when they reached the rousing chorus, \xe2\x80\x9cAux armes citoyens!\xe2\x80\x9d And if these citizens one day take up arms to defend themselves, will they do so as French nationals or as Israelis?'b'On Sunday, France\xe2\x80\x99s president, Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande, made quite clear how he views the situation. He reportedly vowed to Jewish leaders that he would take all necessary measures to defend them, including deploying the army.'b'But it is a devastating prospect that in 2015 the Jews of France might need soldiers to protect them from anti-Semitic violence.'b'For the four Jews who were killed at a Paris grocery store, Israel will be their final resting place.'b'If the only way for Jews to live in France today is behind barracks and guards with guns, perhaps it makes more sense not just for the dead to go to Israel, but also for the living to move to a place where we are the guards, we are the army and we are the government.'b'Leaders in Europe are justifiably trying to figure out what they should be doing to prevent terrorist attacks like the recent massacre at the satirical French newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Regrettably, some politicians are proposing the kind of Internet censorship and surveillance that would do little to protect their citizens but do a lot to infringe on civil liberties.'b'In Paris, a dozen interior ministers from European Union countries including France, Britain and Germany 'b'issued a statement'b' earlier this week calling on Internet service providers to identify and take down online content \xe2\x80\x9cthat aims to incite hatred and terror.\xe2\x80\x9d The ministers also want the European Union to start monitoring and storing information about the itineraries of air travelers. And in Britain, Prime Minister David Cameron 'b'suggested'b' the country should ban Internet services that did not give the government the ability to monitor all encrypted chats and calls.'b'Even before the Charlie Hebdo attack, European leaders were proposing or enacting harsh measures. For example, the French Parliament passed a law in September that allows the authorities to temporarily seize the passports and identity cards of citizens who seem intent on joining foreign terrorist organizations. And this week, French officials said they had 'b'arrested 54 people'b' for hate speech, including a controversial comedian.'b'Appealing as these measures may sound in the aftermath of a tragedy, they are deeply flawed. Countries like France and Germany have long had stricter controls on speech than the United States. For example, their governments have in the past forced Internet firms like 'b'Yahoo'b' and 'b'Twitter'b' to take down Nazi propaganda. But those decisions are generally made by government officials or judges, not technology companies.'b'Internet service providers do not have the staff or the skill to determine what content is likely to lead to terrorist attacks. That is why a blanket mandate to censor terrorism-related information could force these businesses to err on the side of caution and take down information that might be offensive but would not lead to an imminent attack. In fact, an Internet service provider might well have taken down satirical cartoons of the kind Charlie Hebdo published.'b'Besides, even if Internet companies blocked videos and other propaganda produced by terrorist groups from their networks, that action would not necessarily prevent Europeans from finding that information. Terrorist sympathizers could access the banned content relatively easily by using virtual private networks or proxy servers that allow users in one country to pretend they are in a different country, like the United States, where free speech laws are much stronger. Some Europeans are 'b'already using'b' such tools to access American services, like Netflix, that are not yet available in their countries.'b'Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s proposal raises another set of problems. In a speech earlier this week, he said he wanted companies like WhatsApp and Snapchat to create back doors in their services that would allow intelligence services to monitor conversations between users. If the companies refused to comply, he said, they should not be allowed to operate in Britain. Such an approach might seem reasonable to some \xe2\x80\x94 after all, the police can wiretap a landline phone, so why not a messaging service?'b'But technology and privacy advocates say it is dangerous to require technology companies to build such surveillance mechanisms into communications services because hackers and criminals will inevitably find ways to use those back doors to steal information from individuals, corporations and governments.'b'Mr. Cameron\xe2\x80\x99s proposal would make the Internet less secure without necessarily hampering terrorists. People who are determined to communicate with each other in secret can download 'b'encryption software'b' from the Internet and send messages through systems like 'b'Tor'b' that obscure their identities and locations.'b'Of course, governments can and should take steps to identify threats and prevent terrorist attacks through targeted intelligence gathering. But there is good reason to believe that widespread censorship and intrusive surveillance will only undermine personal freedoms and could even make us less secure.'b'TEL AVIV \xe2\x80\x94 There is great irony to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive response to terror attacks on Jews in Europe \xe2\x80\x94 and the devastating attack last week on a kosher grocery store in Paris was no different.'b'Pack your belongings!

They win widespread recognition for their accomplishments and, when the movie ends in 2004, their future is bright.'b'Unfortunately, that\xe2\x80\x99s not how the story really ends.'b'All four students were born in Mexico and were brought across the border illegally as children. Though they grew up in Arizona and viewed themselves as Americans, the law did not. They lived with the daily threat of deportation. Oscar Vazquez dreamed of joining the Army \xe2\x80\x94 he was officer of the year in his J.R.O.T.C. program \xe2\x80\x94 but discovered he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t enlist because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have legal residency. Cristian Arcega was a geeky brainiac who found few outlets for his smarts in gang-torn West Phoenix. Lorenzo Santillan was a former gang member himself looking to stay clean. And Luis Aranda, the only one who had gotten a work permit, just the year before, was a hulking giant of a kid who rarely spoke.'b'This ragtag group from Carl Hayden Community High School in West Phoenix constructed the robot out of cheap plastic tubing and garbage. It smelled so bad, they called the machine Stinky. The other entrants \xe2\x80\x94 almost all college students \xe2\x80\x94 had corporate sponsors and serious budgets. This was an underwater robotics contest, but Carl Hayden didn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a swimming pool. Nonetheless, Stinky came in first place.'b'After the event, lower ranked contestants went on to rewarding jobs at tech companies and research institutes.

Today he works as a line cook. Luis Aranda studied cooking as well but did not complete a degree and now works as a janitor.'b'Cristian Arcega, the most technically skilled member of the team, made it to Arizona State University on a scholarship. But in 2006, during his freshman year, Arizona voters passed Proposition 300, an anti-immigrant measure that prohibits undocumented students from receiving any state financial aid or qualifying for in-state tuition \xe2\x80\x94 more than tripling his tuition. He dropped out and is now unemployed. He is trying to 'b'crowdfund'b' enough money to return to school full time.'b'Oscar Vazquez\xe2\x80\x99s story is the most dramatic. He also had a scholarship to A.S.U., and after working menial jobs for a year, was able to attend. He was a sophomore when Proposition 300 passed, and managed to stay in school only by piecing together more scholarships, all while leading the university\xe2\x80\x99s robotics team to regional championships. He graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering in 2009 and applied for legal residency.'b'Not only was his application denied, but he was also summarily banned from the United States for 10 years for living here without a visa. He ended up working on an assembly line in Mexico.'b'After a year, his ban was reversed when Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, interceded on his behalf. Mr. Vazquez returned, enlisted in the Army, and served a tour of combat duty in Afghanistan. He is finally a citizen, and repairs trains in Montana for the railroad company BNSF.'b'Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the program created by President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive order that shields some undocumented students and young adults from deportation, didn\xe2\x80\x99t go into effect until 2012.

They have surmounted enormous odds, but none were able to professionally pursue their passion for robotics. It is a startling rebuke to the American dream.'b'House Republicans seem to view this as a fitting outcome. This week, John A. Boehner, the speaker of the House, 'b'introduced legislation'b' that would roll back the president\xe2\x80\x99s order. If he is successful, talented young people like Mr. Santillan and Mr. Arcega could be deported at any moment. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter a while you get used to disappointment,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Arcega said to me this week. \xe2\x80\x9cI try not to have high expectations anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those who oppose granting residency to these immigrants argue that it would deny resources to existing residents and citizens. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve already invested in these students all through elementary and high school. Why not continue and get a return on that investment?'b'There is rising demand for the talent these students possess. We grant roughly 85,000 H1B visas, for immigrants with special skills, to engineers to fill jobs here. In doing so, we overlook a generation of students who are deemed foreigners but who grew up here and plan to stay. When their visas expire, a majority of H1B visa holders will leave, and take the skills they developed with them.

Whatever it is that incites lust, it also incites the censorious. Religion is not far behind. You could argue that the two are twined, and it would be hard to rebut.

There could be no real free expression, the American founders recognized, in a nation with a state-sanctioned religion.'b'This freedom, by its very definition, sets up a serious conflict in the interconnected global village. Protected speech in this country is blasphemous in another. Satire, in the form of silly Seth Rogen movie, is a provocation prompting a 'b'cyberwar'b' in the closed society of North Korea.'b'China, rapidly trying to catch up with Western democracies in all things monetary and technological, is medieval in the realm of free expression. This week, China\xe2\x80\x99s state news agency, Xinhua, ran a piece by its Paris bureau chief, who wrote that \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered and unprincipled satire, humiliation and free speech are not acceptable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But even in countries where speech is protected, that freedom is suspect. The Washington Post quoted Nasser Lajili, a French city councilor and a Muslim, who condemned the attacks in Paris with a caveat: \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think freedom of speech needs to stop when it harms the dignity of someone else.\xe2\x80\x9d That same attitude has found a home in American universities, who fear Bill Maher, or the sex columnist Dan Savage.'b'Pope Francis, a voice of reason and progressive thought on most things, took a big step backward Thursday with his comments on expression. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot provoke,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot insult the faith of others.

Other nations may experiment with radical economic policies, but with the Swiss you don\xe2\x80\x99t get surprises.'b'Until you do. On Thursday the Swiss National Bank, the equivalent of the Federal Reserve, 'b'shocked the financial world'b' with a double whammy, simultaneously abandoning its policy of pegging the Swiss franc to the euro and cutting the interest rate it pays on bank reserves to minus, that\xe2\x80\x99s right, minus 0.75 percent. Market turmoil ensued.'b'And you should feel a shiver of fear, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any direct financial stake in the value of the franc. For Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99s monetary travails illustrate in miniature just how hard it is to fight the deflationary vortex now dragging down much of the world economy.'b'What you need to understand is that all the usual rules of economic policy changed when financial crisis struck in 2008; we entered a looking-glass world, and we still haven\xe2\x80\x99t emerged. In many cases, economic virtues became vices: Willingness to save became a drag on investment, fiscal probity a route to stagnation. And in the case of the Swiss, having a reputation for safe banks and sound money became a major liability.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how it worked: When Greece entered its debt crisis at the end of 2009, and other European nations found themselves under severe stress, money seeking a safe haven began pouring into Switzerland. This in turn sent the 'b'Swiss franc soaring'b', with devastating effects on the competitiveness of Swiss manufacturing, and threatened to push Switzerland \xe2\x80\x94 which already had very low inflation and very low interest rates \xe2\x80\x94 into Japanese-style deflation.'b'So Swiss monetary officials went all out in an effort to weaken their currency. You might think that making your currency worth less is easy \xe2\x80\x94 can\xe2\x80\x99t you just print more bills? \xe2\x80\x94 but in the post-crisis world it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy at all. Just printing money and stuffing it into the banks does nothing; it just sits there. The Swiss tried a more direct approach, selling francs and buying euros on the foreign exchange market, in the process acquiring a huge hoard of euros. But even that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t doing the trick.'b'Then, in 2011, the Swiss National Bank tried a psychological tactic. \xe2\x80\x9cThe current massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc,\xe2\x80\x9d it declared, \xe2\x80\x9cposes an acute threat to the Swiss economy and carries the 'b'risk of a deflationary development'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d And it therefore announced that it would set a minimum value for the euro \xe2\x80\x94 1.2 Swiss francs \xe2\x80\x94 and that to enforce this minimum it was \xe2\x80\x9cprepared to buy foreign currency in unlimited quantities.\xe2\x80\x9d What the bank clearly hoped was that by drawing this line in the sand it would limit the number of euros it actually had to buy.'b'And for three years it worked. But on Thursday the Swiss suddenly gave up. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly why; nobody I know believes the official explanation, that it\xe2\x80\x99s a response to a weakening euro. But it seems likely that a fresh wave of safe-haven money was making the effort to keep the franc down too expensive.'b'If you ask me, the Swiss just made a big mistake. But frankly \xe2\x80\x94 francly? \xe2\x80\x94 the fate of Switzerland isn\xe2\x80\x99t the important issue. What\xe2\x80\x99s important, instead, is the demonstration of just how hard it is to fight the deflationary forces that are now afflicting much of the world \xe2\x80\x94 not just Europe and Japan, but 'b'quite possibly China too'b'. And while America has had a pretty good run the past few quarters, it would be foolish to assume that we\xe2\x80\x99re immune.'b'What this says is that you really, really shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let yourself get too close to deflation \xe2\x80\x94 you might fall in, and then it\xe2\x80\x99s extremely hard to get out. This is one reason that slashing government spending in a depressed economy is such a bad idea: It\xe2\x80\x99s not just the immediate cost in lost jobs, but the increased risk of getting caught in a deflationary trap.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also a reason to be very cautious about raising interest rates when you have low inflation, even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t think deflation is imminent. Right now serious people \xe2\x80\x94 the same serious people who decided, wrongly, that 2010 was the year we should pivot from jobs to deficits \xe2\x80\x94 seem to be arriving at a consensus that 'b'the Fed should start hiking'b' very soon. But why? There\xe2\x80\x99s no sign of accelerating inflation in the actual data, and 'b'market indicators of expected inflation'b' are plunging, suggesting that investors see deflationary risk even if the Fed doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'And I share that market concern. If the U.S. recovery weakens, either through contagion from troubles abroad or because our own fundamentals aren\xe2\x80\x99t as strong as we think, tightening monetary policy could all too easily prove to be an act of utter folly.'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s learn from the Swiss. They\xe2\x80\x99ve been careful; they\xe2\x80\x99ve maintained sound money for generations. And now they\xe2\x80\x99re paying the price.'b'If the Republican presidential campaign were \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Idol\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voice,\xe2\x80\x9d this would be the out-of-town auditions phase. Governors across the country are giving State of the State addresses, unveiling their visions. Let\xe2\x80\x99s spin the chairs and grade the contenders, to see who deserves a shot at the big show.'b'John Kasich: A. The Ohio governor is easily the most underestimated Republican this year.

If he shows he can raise money, and if voters want someone fresh but seasoned and managerial, he might be the guy.'b'The inaugural address he delivered on Monday was a straight-up values speech. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t about values the way Pat Robertson used to define them. It was traditional values expressed in inclusive, largely secular form. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the erosion of basic values that made our nation great is the most serious problem facing our state and our nation today,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking about those volatile issues.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He built his speech around empathy, resilience, responsibility and other virtues: \xe2\x80\x9cYou know why this happened? Too fixated on ourselves. It\xe2\x80\x99s all about me. And somehow we have lost the beautiful sound of our neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 voices.

Did you ever find that in yourself? I do ... self-righteous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kasich has a long conservative record, but in his speech he celebrated government workers, like the woman who runs his job and family services department. He argued that economic growth is not an end unto itself, especially when it\xe2\x80\x99s not widely shared.'b'Kasich, a working-class kid, spoke as a small government conservative who sometimes uses government to advance Judeo-Christian values. His mantra is, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\xe2\x80\x99s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small, but he is going to ask you what you did for the poor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Chris Christie: A-minus. Bridgegate did some damage, but it clearly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t fatal. Whatever can be said about Christie, he grabs attention \xe2\x80\x94 essential in a crowded field.'b'Like all smart Republicans in the post-Romney era (yes, we\xe2\x80\x99re in it), Christie is working hard to prove he understands the everyday concerns of the poor and the middle class. He spent a good chunk of his address describing his efforts to work with the Democratic mayor of Camden to bring in jobs, fight poverty and reduce crime in that city. It was a bipartisan, government-efficiency pitch: \xe2\x80\x9cWe terminated the city police department and, partnering with the county, put a new metro division on the streets with 400 officers for the same price we were paying for 260. ... What are the results? Murder down 51 percent, in what was once called the most dangerous city in America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As Chris Cillizza of The Washington Post noticed, Christie defined anxiety as America\xe2\x80\x99s most daunting problem. He said that as he traveled the country, \xe2\x80\x9canxiety was the most palpable emotion that I saw and felt. More than anger, more than fear.\xe2\x80\x9d Christie hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite nailed down the nature of that anxiety, or what to do about it, but he\xe2\x80\x99s clearly hit on an essential theme for an era of economic growth but dissatisfaction.'b'Scott Walker and Mike Pence: B-plus. The Wisconsin and Indiana governors are both versions of what used to be called working-class, Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Club Republicanism. Walker never graduated from college.'b'In their State of the State addresses, both boasted about the same sorts of accomplishments: dropping unemployment rates, state surpluses, rising graduation rates, lower taxes. Walker mentioned jobs programs for people with disabilities. Pence, who has devoted more effort to fighting poverty, touted his new pre-K education program. Both have good records, but neither speech had anything that was narratively or thematically innovative or of much interest to people outside their states.'b'At this stage in the race it\xe2\x80\x99s best to evaluate candidates the way you evaluate pitchers during the first week of spring training. Don\xe2\x80\x99t think about polls, donor gossip or who has the front-runner label. Ask who makes the catcher\xe2\x80\x99s glove pop loudest. Who has the stuff that makes you do a double take?'b'Among the governors, Kasich and Christie have shown they can take the values of religious conservatives and use them to inform Republican economic and domestic priorities. That\xe2\x80\x99s essential if the party is going to retain its business and religious base and also reach the struggling and disaffected.'b'Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan rebuffed heavy lobbying by the National Rifle Association and vetoed a patently dangerous gun measure Thursday that would have compounded the risks for women caught in domestic abuse cases. The measure, quietly passed by the Republican Legislature at the behest of the gun lobby, would have allowed gun permits for abusers in domestic violence and stalking cases \xe2\x80\x94 even those under a court-issued restraining order \xe2\x80\x94 if judges neglected to issue an explicit ban.'b'Under current law, denial of a gun license is automatic for abusers in domestic violence and stalking cases. Mr. Snyder, a Republican, firmly upheld that law with his veto, forthrightly declaring, \xe2\x80\x9cWe simply can\xe2\x80\x99t and won\xe2\x80\x99t take the chance of exposing domestic abuse victims to additional violence or intimidation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With his veto, which gun safety proponents must hope is a harbinger of more N.R.A. defeats, the governor stood as the rare Republican leader willing to buck the powerful gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s statehouse clout and political threats. Mr. Snyder had been heavily petitioned by both the gun lobby and leaders of gun safety groups, who have been increasingly focused on statehouses as potentially more responsive than Congress to act against gun violence, which claims tens of thousands of lives each year.'b'Mr. Snyder focused on explosive family situations in explaining his veto. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s crucial that we leave in place protections for people who already have endured challenges and abuse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Snyder said.'b'Women living with a gun in the home are more than twice as likely to be murdered than those with no gun on the premises, according to a study in the journal Annals of Emergency Medicine. Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to be murdered by guns than women in other high-income countries, according to Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, a group that worked against the measure in Lansing.'b'The gun proposal was attached as a bargaining chip to a road funding bill last month in the closing midnight hours of the legislative session. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can make a mountain out of a molehill,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Mike Green, the measure\xe2\x80\x99s Republican sponsor, callously commented when asked by The Detroit Free Press if domestic abuse victims should be alarmed. They certainly should be in a state where the number of concealed-weapon permits has leapt from 100,000 in 2001 to nearly 600,000 last year.'b'Proponents pathetically tried to sell the measure as a safeguard for domestic abuse victims, since it also said that they, too, could qualify for a pistol permit for self-defense.

DANIELS'b'\nNew York, Jan. 12, 2015'b''b'In recent weeks, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has repeatedly noted his concern about the unhealthy tensions in New York City between the police and Mayor Bill de Blasio. He also sees an alluring political vacuum tempting him to step forward as an impartial healer and arbitrator. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everybody in New York City knows that this situation is unsustainable,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Wednesday morning.'b'There is indeed a useful role here for Mr. Cuomo. But much depends on how he plays it. It won\xe2\x80\x99t help if he comes barging in as a competitor to the mayor, intent on muscling through a negotiated peace. He could help a great deal if he acts as a partner instead.'b'Mr. Cuomo has already offered a few useful ideas. During a recent preview of his annual budget presentation and State of the State address next week, he hinted at possible reforms of the grand jury system, following a Staten Island grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s failure to indict a police officer in the death of an unarmed civilian, Eric Garner. He also spoke of the need to better protect police officers in the line of duty.'b'There are other concrete measures he can take to help:'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 He should resist efforts by the police unions to undermine parts of a crucial pension reform 'b'approved in 2012'b'. With pension rates for state and local government employees rising rapidly, Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s pension package that year was designed to cut rates statewide for future employees by $80 billion over 30 years. It increased the retirement age for most employees, reduced pension padding and raised pension contribution rates, among other changes.'b'The unions were furious, New York City police officials particularly so because newer employees who became disabled on the job would get only half of their salary as one part of their pension, not the usual 75 percent.'b'Now the unions are using their unhappiness with Mr. de Blasio to curry favor with Mr. Cuomo, and to persuade him to reopen the pension law and increase disability pensions for newer employees. This would not only undermine the 2012 reforms but would wind up costing the city about $6 billion over 30 years for all uniformed employees. Mr. Cuomo, who once called the reforms \xe2\x80\x9cbold and transformational,\xe2\x80\x9d should not retreat now. He cannot claim to make peace in the city if his changes in state law stick the city with that kind of tab.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 He should push the Legislature to pass a law creating an independent prosecutor whenever an unarmed civilian is killed at the hands of the police. If the legislators won\xe2\x80\x99t agree, he can on his own initiative confer that power on the state\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman. Local prosecutors have an inherent conflict of interest because they work so closely with the police. There should be another option in cases where the police are involved.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 He should veto a 'b'sneaky little bill'b' that passed without notice last year and would vastly undermine the authority of the city\xe2\x80\x99s police commissioner in disciplinary matters. Instead of allowing the commissioner to mete out proper punishment to wayward officers, it would leave the choices to collective bargaining, giving the police union far too much control over important personnel decisions.'b'Mr. Cuomo has lamented that recent shootings and protests have left people \xe2\x80\x9cconfused, disappointed and angry\xe2\x80\x9d about the justice system. He has the power to help heal those wounds if he treads very carefully.'b'This past fall, a project started called ('b'Human) Wasteland'b', which maps reports of human waste throughout the city of San Francisco. Yes, a disproportionate amount of poop on the streets is not from dogs but from humans.'b'Some in the blogosphere tended to play this for laughs, but the reality isn\xe2\x80\x99t very funny. There are thousands of homeless people in San Francisco and scant access to public bathrooms. We associate sanitation problems with the Third World, not the First, but the fact is that even in a city like this one, bursting from all its economic growth, more than 7,000 people are homeless and without places to sleep \xe2\x80\x94 or go to the bathroom.'b'Perhaps more than any other city, San Francisco loves process and, accordingly, a consortium of groups led by 'b'Hyphae Design Lab'b' published a comprehensive \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Public Toilet Project Masterplan'b'\xe2\x80\x9d to design and deploy better public restrooms in the city. Design can\xe2\x80\x99t solve homelessness, but a number of interesting projects like this one have emerged that offer thoughtful \xe2\x80\x94 albeit incremental \xe2\x80\x94 solutions to the problems that arise from it.'b'The Tenderloin Public Toilet Project (better known as the PPlanter), created by Hyphae Design Laboratory through a participatory design process, is one. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cheap and mobile street urinal with sink that doubles as a planter and was built for $2,000. (As an added bonus in this drought-plagued state, the urine collected, after being filtered, is used to water the plants.) PPlanter underwent a test phase in 2103 and a second version is currently set up at a truck stop and a community outreach center in West Oakland.'b'The goal is still to provide this Tenderloin project as a free service, but as Hyphae\xe2\x80\x99s Brent Bucknum explains, long-term maintenance continues to be the major hurdle in funding new models of urban sanitation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEither we need cities and economic development agencies to earmark money for public services, once again, or we need more of a \xe2\x80\x98pay-as-you-go model,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cA secondary social benefit of this model would be that the project would provide a more socially universal solution for tourists, workers \xe2\x80\x94 and everyone else. This is just another thought, in a still very uncharted interesting new arena for urban infrastructure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Virginia Gardiner began her research on a waterless toilet system that turns human waste into a source of clean energy when she was a graduate student in industrial design. Today, she\xe2\x80\x99s CEO of Loowatt, a London-based company that produces context-specific toilets that use a patented sealing mechanism to wrap human waste in biodegradable polymer film. The film, which lines the toilet bowl, is pulled through the mechanism when the toilet is \xe2\x80\x9cflushed,\xe2\x80\x9d enclosing the waste in a removable cartridge. The cartridge is then emptied, daily to weekly depending upon factors like location and usage patterns, into an anaerobic digester, where the waste and polymer film are converted into natural gas and fertilizer.'b'The innovations here lie in the waterless toilet that provides a hygienic and odorless experience and the value-generating treatment solution that supports the toilet. Loowatt toilets can be built in many shapes and sizes, to work in a variety of different scenarios.'b'Currently, the technology is used to serve highly disparate communities: A pilot program in Madagascar features home toilets that are linked to an energy-generating digester in the community. In London, a modified version is deployed at events and festivals in locations where water or power is in short supply. \xe2\x80\x9cThis started out as just the idea to make a value-generating waterless toilet, and to challenge the \xe2\x80\x98flush and forget\xe2\x80\x99 norm that I grew up taking for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gardiner. \xe2\x80\x9cLater I became aware of the many practical applications.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Back in San Francisco, 'b'LavaMae'b' (a play on \xe2\x80\x9cwash me\xe2\x80\x9d in Spanish) expands the program to include showers, because there are only eight shelter facilities in San Francisco that offer public showers. LavaMae uses a repurposed city bus outfitted with two shower-and-toilet modules to \xe2\x80\x9cdeliver dignity, one shower at a time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Painted bright blue, the bus announces it presence boldly \xe2\x80\x94 LavaMae\xe2\x80\x99s founder envisions a future version featuring LED screens with programmed messages about homelessness to help break down stereotypes around it \xe2\x80\x94 as it parks in two different locations for several hours at a time, three times a week, to serve San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s homeless population (including the neighborhoods that rank highest on the aforementioned waste map). In 2015, LavaMae is ramping up from one bus to four \xe2\x80\x94 and it needs to.'b'The idea for LavaMae was born from the frustration of a public relations executive, Doniece Sondaval, who witnessed the rapid gentrification of her neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 and the displacement of neighbors that has come with it. To pull off this modestly scaled but expanding endeavor, she has assembled an eclectic group of public and private sector partners, from Google to Kohler to the San Francisco Department of Public Health, to provide a basic service. Its implementation \xe2\x80\x94 requiring everything from access to fire hydrants to the obtaining of street parking permits \xe2\x80\x94 has been arduous, but that bus, once destined for the scrap heap, now assists in deterring potential public health problems and, perhaps most critically, in helping a population struggling to retain its dignity.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe call them guests,\xe2\x80\x9d says Sandoval when talking about the thousands of people who\xe2\x80\x99ve used the service in its first six months. \xe2\x80\x9cWe realize that we\xe2\x80\x99re in the hospitality business. We\xe2\x80\x99re not doing case management; we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get these folks cleaned up, trying to help eliminate the obstacles if they\xe2\x80\x99re applying for jobs or we\xe2\x80\x99ve found that they have jobs and they\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to stay clean. We want them to feel like we\xe2\x80\x99ve created something just for them, that when they\xe2\x80\x99re here we care about them and that we see them as people. We see a lot of regulars so we know their names, know their stories. It\xe2\x80\x99s had an impact we didn\xe2\x80\x99t anticipate having.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sandoval\xe2\x80\x99s background in P.R. and marketing shows in all the good ways on this project: LavaMae takes its visual cues from design-savvy brands like Method Cleaner and Virgin America (if only all the city\xe2\x80\x99s buses looked so good), was initially financed by a crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, and has a temporary existence in line with the current vogue for tactical urbanism. Sandoval and Lava Mae\xe2\x80\x99s designer, the architect 'b'Brett Terpeluk'b', wanted to create a beautiful design for a population that always gets castoffs. A mobile shower facility doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9csolve\xe2\x80\x9d homelessness, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a proactive response to a dire need.'b"Sandoval harbors no fantasies about LavaMae as a permanent solution. For her, the shower facilities are an end goal. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be a permanent fixture,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI think this should be a government responsibility. I want the government to say, \xe2\x80\x98a private citizen has stepped forward to show us the desire and need for this, so let\xe2\x80\x99s go for it.'\xe2\x80\x9d"b'Indeed, while the ingenuity of these efforts is indisputable, what it all means for the future of services once squarely in the domain of government is more complicated. With everything from parks to health care to transportation, the respective roles of the private and public sectors are evolving \xe2\x80\x94 and are more and more complex. Are we to view the convenience and increasing ubiquity of Uber as a replacement for public transit? (Some do.) A for-profit endeavor like 'b'HandUp'b' crowdsources funding for homeless individuals (the donor selects the person he or she wants to help), but should we see it as a replacement for city services? What does this sort of targeted solutionism mean for civic responsibility? For the social contract?'b'The question of whether the right funding models exist for social impact projects like these remains. PPlanter had highly successful test runs last year employing homeless residents to do maintenance, for example. This provided a compelling way to monitor both the social and technical aspects of the project but establishing the structures to employ the homeless through government models has been challenging, Bucknum says: \xe2\x80\x9cDespite this amazing social infrastructure prototype, we have not found funding outside of initial government grants for construction, from the private sector.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Our country is confronting so many issues that feel intractable, from homelessness to inequality, climate change to immigration. It\xe2\x80\x99s normal to feel overwhelmed, even hopeless, and then to respond with apathy, despair or inaction. Small-scale projects like PPlanter, Loowatt and LavaMae should be embraced \xe2\x80\x94 but as part of a more systemic approach. No single intervention, whether it comes from economists, architects or scientists, is enough. But a bunch of good ones can help show the way.'b'The last time Greeks faced a general election, two and a half years ago, the eurozone faced an existential crisis. There were rumors of bank runs in Athens, of pre-emptive Iberian exits from the monetary union, even of Germans unilaterally calling it quits. Greeks are now returning to the polls on Jan. 25 to face choices similar to those in 2012.'b'One beleaguered option is to \xe2\x80\x9cstay the course\xe2\x80\x9d of their international bailout arrangements and the harsh adjustments they impose. This is the position argued by Prime Minister 'b'Antonis Samaras'b'. The alternative is \xe2\x80\x9canything else\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a cacophonous policy mix proposed by the main opposition party, Syriza. Depending on whom you ask, this includes a unilateral moratorium on foreign debt and the rollback of the structural reforms that have helped restore international competitiveness and fiscal sustainability.'b'Yet something crucial that has been ignored by most media has changed since 2012. These elections are not about how to manage the economic debacle, but rather about how to steer an incipient recovery. The Greek economy has been growing since the first quarter of last year, according to Eurostat. In the third quarter, the country\xe2\x80\x99s growth was higher than that of any other eurozone member, including Germany. This is not just a rebound: Unemployment has been declining and now stands roughly where it was before the worst point of the crisis two years ago. All this suggests that reforms are belatedly but surely yielding results.'b'Yet with elections just one week away, political risk is back in vogue. Over the last two months, as elections became certain, markets fretted. From the investors\xe2\x80\x99 point of view, the main risk is that the Greeks will opt for a Syriza government, ushering a confrontation with the country\xe2\x80\x99s lenders and a shaky macroeconomic policy plan based on nationalization, forced wage inflation and unaffordable subsidies. Given where polls stand, a Syriza government with some moderating coalition force is the most likely outcome.'b'Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s leader, 'b'Alexis Tsipras'b', has worked to soften his party\xe2\x80\x99s image since the last elections. A few months ago he could be found at the Ambrosetti Forum on the shores of Lake Como, preaching the values of European integration and the importance of the euro. He has surrounded himself with economists who profess a willingness to come to a \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiated solution\xe2\x80\x9d with the country\xe2\x80\x99s creditors and who frequently clash with the party rank-and-file who favor unilateral default and \xe2\x80\x9cGrexit.\xe2\x80\x9d Ultimately, however, there is no way around it: The party\xe2\x80\x99s ideology is hostile to the market economy and the reforms 'b'Greece'b' has been implementing.'b'The clearest indication of what Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s policy plan would mean came from Tsipras himself. In September 2012, he stated in the Greek Parliament that he wished the country \xe2\x80\x9chad become 'b'Argentina'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Back in 2011 economists such as Nouriel Roubini and Paul Krugman also used Argentina as an example to follow. Even last weekend, in the midst of the campaign, Prime Minister Samaras addressed Argentina and its 2001 debt crisis. So what does it mean to \xe2\x80\x9cturn into Argentina?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The last decade of Argentine economic history offers two valuable lessons for Greece. The first is that Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s threat of a debt moratorium is an empty one: Debts do not go away just because one chooses not to pay them. Witness Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s decade-long legal saga in New York courts. The country\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay holdouts of its debt restructuring in 2005 has not ushered in prosperity; it has brought a prolonged legal battle, isolation from world markets, and as of last summer, a second default. There is no reason to believe a unilateral Greek refusal to pay would yield different results.'b'What is more, Greece\xe2\x80\x99s eurozone partners have already said they would consider negotiating on debt relief \xe2\x80\x94 provided Greece sticks to its commitments and negotiates in earnest within the framework of the eurozone. And unlike in 2010, the monetary union now possesses the processes and institutions to deal with fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances in an orderly manner, rather than the ad hoc fashion \xe2\x80\x94 to put it mildly \xe2\x80\x94 advocated by Syriza.'b'The second lesson is perhaps more crucial: Economic populism and monetary wizardry are short-sighted. They do not yield development, only isolation and imbalances. In the case of Argentina, after a decade of extremely heterodox policy, citizens have to contend with stagflation \xe2\x80\x94 meaning negative growth and around 40 percent of annual inflation \xe2\x80\x94 capital controls, anachronistic foreign currency controls, and increasingly authoritarian economic management by a government eager to micromanage the behavior of private companies. This is why a country as energy-rich as Argentina finds itself importing natural gas at exorbitant prices just to keep the lights on.'b'No development can be built that way. It is hard to believe that Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s talk of \xe2\x80\x9cfree electricity\xe2\x80\x9d and a renationalization of the energy market would lead to a better outcome. It should therefore come as no surprise that when Argentines head to their own polls later this year, they will elect a government eager to undo these policies and reintegrate the country into the world.'b'The Greek dilemma is different from Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s in yet another way. Its debt negotiations are not with private holdouts from an imperfect restructuring. They are with fellow eurozone countries, some of which are poorer than Greece, and pay higher interest rates to finance Greek loans. The moral dimension of defaulting on the Slovakian taxpayer \xe2\x80\x94 who has to make do with a much lower minimum wage than his Greek counterpart \xe2\x80\x94 is at least as dishonest as the economic rationale behind Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s plans. The only alternative here is a negotiated way respecting both the existing agreements and European solidarity, a value that may not be financial but is at the cornerstone of the support Greece got at its time of most need.'b'Mr. Tsipras is right about one thing: Argentina offers apt economic parallels for the Greek electorate. But it is an example to avoid, not to follow. Debt default and unilateral withdrawal from the globalized world would not lead Greece to a renaissance. It would lead the country back to ruin. After years of recession and reforms, it would be a sad sight for Greece to follow Argentina, precisely when the former is recovering and the latter is finally about to turn its back on shortsighted populism.'b'TOKYO \xe2\x80\x94  Bolstered by his party\xe2\x80\x99s victory in Diet elections last month, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has renewed his vow to free 'b'Japan'b' from the fetters of the past, especially its defeat in 'b'World War II'b'. Mr. Abe and his supporters view the prevailing accounts of that era as \xe2\x80\x9cmasochistic\xe2\x80\x9d and a hindrance to taking pride in what he calls the \xe2\x80\x9cnew Japan.\xe2\x80\x9d They propose to modify the article in Japan\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution that states the Japanese people \xe2\x80\x9cforever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These aspirations have been laid out in a map of Japan that the Japanese Foreign Ministry published on its website last April, with translations in 12 languages. The map extends beyond Japan\xe2\x80\x99s internationally recognized boundaries, incorporating in the name of ryodo \xe2\x80\x94 or the \xe2\x80\x9cinherent territory\xe2\x80\x9d of Japan \xe2\x80\x94 many islands claimed by neighboring countries. Those lands,  the argument goes, are integral to  Japan\xe2\x80\x99s very being.'b'In fact, the Abe government\xe2\x80\x99s expansionist view undermines Japan\xe2\x80\x99s interests, both economic and strategic.'b'Ryodo promotes a notion of Japan\xe2\x80\x99s territory that circumvents history, particularly the history of how Japan laid claim to these islands in the first place \xe2\x80\x94 through imperial wars with 'b'China'b' and 'b'Russia'b', through wars of conquest against Koreans, through the extermination or assimilation of indigenous peoples.'b'Partly as a result, Japan is embroiled in many territorial disputes. China and 'b'Taiwan'b' contest the Senkaku Islands, which Beijing calls the Diaoyu and Taipei the Diaoyutai. South Korea claims Takeshima (calling it Dokdo) where it has stationed military police since 1954. Russia claims sovereignty over what Japanese know as the Northern Territories, four islands in the Kuril chain northeast of Hokkaido where Russians have lived since 1945, numbering about 20,000 today.'b'Under the terms of the United Nations Convention on the 'b'Law of the Sea'b' (UNCLOS), Japan already has access to vast fisheries and rides up to $3.6 trillion in seabed materials. The disputed islands would add much more.'b'According to some estimates, including by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the East China Sea holds 200 million barrels in proved and probable 'b'oil'b' reserves (the world consumes around 90 million barrels of liquid fuels each day) and between 1 and 2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas (the United States consumed about 26 trillion cubic feet in 2013). Japan and China contest nearly 17 percent of the area.'b'A volcano on one of the southern Kurils has rhenium, a rare-earth metal with a melting point that makes jet-engine designers dream. There are also vast quantities of untapped methane hydrate in the seabed between Japan and the Korean Peninsula. After gas was extracted from similar deposits elsewhere for the first time in 2013, a spokesman for the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National Corporation said, \xe2\x80\x9cJapan could finally have an energy source to call its own.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The lure of such riches might seem like reason enough for resource-poor Japan to claim these territories. The government spent $250 billion on imported fuel in 2012. And the cost of decommissioning the nuclear reactors at Fukushima after the meltdown following the March 2011 tsunami is expected to reach at least $90 billion.'b'Yet Japan risks losing access to many of these resources because of its brinksmanship. UNCLOS does not determine sovereignty over land, and it allows for joint development agreements in waters around contested territory. When disputes heat up, however, they naturally tend to scuttle any joint schemes.'b'In 2008 China and Japan agreed to explore together four gas fields in the East China Sea. But the project was scuttled the following year, after China went at it alone. Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s maximalist policy only undermines the prospects that this development project could be revived, or that new ones involving Japan might be struck.'b'The costs of Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s territorial revisionism are also strategic. Ryodo implicitly dismisses as partial the terms of the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, which formally ended World War II between Japan and the Allies. The agreement redrew Japan from the massive empire it had become during the war \xe2\x80\x94 stretching from northern China to Guadalcanal \xe2\x80\x94 more or less into the country familiar today. (Some islands, notably Okinawa, reverted to Japan in the intervening years.) Many Japanese at the time, including Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi \xe2\x80\x94 who was accused of being a Class A war criminal \xe2\x80\x94 were infuriated, claiming in particular that the Kurils were \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d to the Japanese.'b'In a separate agreement that went into force at the same time, the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty of 1951, the United States would \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain armed forces of its own in and about Japan\xe2\x80\x9d in order \xe2\x80\x9cto deter armed attack upon Japan.\xe2\x80\x9d By the time the treaty was revised in 1960, Japan had acquired limited self-defense forces, and the two countries undertook various commitments in case of \xe2\x80\x9can armed attack against either Party in the territories under the administration of Japan.\xe2\x80\x9d These still stand today, hence the critical importance also for the U.S. government of properly defining what Japan is.'b'Officials in Washington and Tokyo are currently reviewing each side\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities in the event of a threat to the peace and security of Japan. One fraught issue is the United States\xe2\x80\x99 dual obligation, under separate security arrangements, to defend both Japan and South Korea because one could attack the other over territory they both claim. In other words, the very notion of ryodo challenges the United States\xe2\x80\x99 postwar security commitments even as it risks triggering them.'b'Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s revanchist view of the past is central to his vision of a future in which Japan \xe2\x80\x9conce again shines on the world\xe2\x80\x99s center stage.\xe2\x80\x9d But it distorts history in  a way that undermines the country\xe2\x80\x99s major interests and, arguably, its identity. The constitutional changes advocated by Mr. Abe\xe2\x80\x99s party include an \xe2\x80\x9cobligation\xe2\x80\x9d for citizens of Japan to \xe2\x80\x9cdefend the nation\xe2\x80\x99s inherent territory, inherent seas and inherent skies,\xe2\x80\x9d disputed islands and all. The proposed draft adds that, \xe2\x80\x9cAll citizens must honor the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting that failure to do so could endanger their rights, maybe their citizenship. In his bid to claim more for Japan, Mr. Abe may reap less.'b''b'\n'b'Alexis Dudden 'b'is a professor of history at the University of Connecticut.'b''b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  On Tuesday, the French police arrested the controversial French comedian Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala.

Last year, the courts banned his stage show, and he has been convicted several times for anti-Semitic hate speech. But for his supporters, many of whom live on the outskirts of French cities in the banlieues that are home to much of 'b'France'b'\xe2\x80\x99s North African population, the attempts to silence Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala exemplify the double standards of French society. The right of a satirical magazine to mock Islam is held sacred, they argue, yet Muslims are forbidden to express views that others may consider offensive.'b'The cases of Charlie Hebdo and Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala are not directly comparable. One published cartoons that many found objectionable because they lampooned their faith; the other seemingly identified with a terrorist who had killed Jews simply because they were Jews. Nevertheless, the arrest of Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala after all the eulogizing of free speech over the past week suggests that the French authorities still do not understand what it means.'b'France\xe2\x80\x99s attitude to free speech is fraught. On one hand, the republic prides itself as the nation of Voltaire, with a tradition of trenchant social satire \xe2\x80\x94 to which Charlie Hebdo clearly saw itself as heir. On the other hand, France has restrictive privacy laws, some of the toughest hate speech laws in the European Union and a ban on Holocaust denial. This combination of Voltairean bravado and restrictive measures has created a deeply contradictory attitude toward free speech.'b'The Roman Catholic Church was a favorite target for French satirists, but its power and influence have long since declined. French anticlericalism has found instead a new object: Islam. But Islam plays a complex role in French society. France\xe2\x80\x99s North African communities are predominantly secular, but within them, Islam acts as a deeply conservative force. At the same time, politicians and pundits often present Islam as a threat to French values and identity and insist on labeling the whole North African population as Muslim. This creates a perception of North African communities as not really being part of the French nation, and justifies discrimination against them.'b'At the same time, a consciousness of the sordid history of French anti-Semitism \xe2\x80\x94 from the Dreyfus affair to the Vichy regime \xe2\x80\x94 means that writers and cartoonists are far less willing to cross the line when it comes to making jokes about Jews or Judaism than they are about Muslims or Islam.'b'It is not difficult to understand why many, particularly within North African communities, see in this a case of unequal treatment \xe2\x80\x94 of certain communities having special protections, while others have to put up with hatred and offense. For some inhabitants of the banlieues, this has only encouraged disengagement from mainstream society, fueled conspiracy theories and entrenched anti-Semitic views.'b'No one has more deftly fused anti-Semitism and anti-system hatred than Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala. And the attempts to silence him have merely sharpened his supporters\xe2\x80\x99 sense of being discriminated against and despised.'b'What is the right response to such hypocrisy and double standards? One approach is to insist that the laws against hate speech should be extended, so that Islam, for instance, gets equal protection from insult. This is the argument of many Muslim activists and antiracist campaigners. But this is to confuse the giving of offense with the promotion of hatred. It is also to betray those within Muslim communities who are fighting against reactionary religious ideas and institutions.'b'Social change cannot happen without causing offense. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t say that!\xe2\x80\x9d is all too often the response of those in power to having that power challenged. To accept that certain things cannot be said is to accept that certain forms of power cannot be challenged. Those who most suffer from such censorship are minorities themselves.'b'The other way to confront double standards is not by extending restrictions, but by extending speech. Mr. M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala may be an anti-Semite, but he should have the right to express his bigotry. To talk of freedom of expression for everyone but bigots is to hollow out the principle.'b'One cannot, in any case, challenge prejudice in practice by banning it; that simply lets the sentiments fester underground. It is only through freedom of expression that we can articulate our disagreements and truly challenge \xe2\x80\x94 and, if necessary, mock \xe2\x80\x94 the ideas of others, whether they are bigots or not.'b'To end this damaging and divisive double standard, we need to permit more, not less, speech.'b''b'\n'b'Kenan Malik, 'b'a writer, lecturer and broadcaster, is the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Quest for a Moral Compass: A Global History of Ethics.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'HONG KONG \xe2\x80\x94  A Chinese government official I know was put under shuanggui, the secretive system of internal Communist Party investigation in which victims are detained, questioned without counsel and sometimes tortured.

Yet suspicions persist that the crackdown is selective.'b'In my view, the anticorruption push is more of a Stalinist purge than a genuine attempt to clean up the government. Charges are framed with reference to party regulations, not the law. Investigations are run by K.G.B.-type cadres, not the regular judicial system. China\xe2\x80\x99s media does not report on cases until they are made public, after which there is a barrage of almost identically worded reports used to incriminate the suspect. Most telling of all, the purge has mainly targeted specific party factions, while those groups that support and pledge loyalty to Mr. Xi appear untouched.'b'Many analysts say that Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s most important supporters are the so-called second generation reds \xe2\x80\x94 descendants of senior Communist Party founders. (Mr. Xi himself is one of them.) This privileged tribe enjoys almost unimaginable power, access to limitless resources, and extraordinary opportunities for enrichment. They are seldom investigated.'b'The rule-proving exception, the former Chongqing party chief Bo Xilai, fell from grace after a power struggle rather than from the amount of money he embezzled, as the government claimed. (Before Mr. Xi rose to power, Mr. Bo was his most powerful rival within the party.)'b'Even so, the handling of Mr. Bo\xe2\x80\x99s case differed greatly from those of officials cut from humbler cloth, such as Zhou Yongkang, a former high-ranking official without family ties to party elite who is now under investigation for corruption. The waves of arrests during the investigation of Mr. Zhou swept up his family, staff and extended to the departments and places where he had worked before. To deal with Mr. Zhou, the net was cast wide across Sichuan Province and the oil industry.'b'High officials in China exercise unchecked power (until they don\xe2\x80\x99t). There are few restrictions on their ability to promote their followers, and they can be brazen in accepting bribes. Their departments, their territories \xe2\x80\x94 these are their private domains. Just as the former party secretary of Taian, Hu Jianxue, famously remarked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen an official reaches my level, he answers to no one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But in Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s former fiefdoms \xe2\x80\x94  before attaining national power he held office in Fujian and Zhejiang provinces \xe2\x80\x94 as best I can tell not one official above the deputy provincial level has been arrested for corruption. Recently the question was raised in a post on the Internet: Why have no \xe2\x80\x9cbig tigers\xe2\x80\x9d been found in Fujian and Zhejiang?  The message was almost immediately deleted.'b'It seems unlikely that Mr. Xi will let this campaign roll on indefinitely. If the investigations of high officials continue into Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s second five-year term, it might suggest personal incompetence. Once Mr. Xi has vanquished any possible perceived threats to his power, he will end it. And when it\xe2\x80\x99s over, Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s  network of followers will revert to  their corrupt ways.'b'Yet many Chinese people harbor illusions about Mr. Xi. At a recent get together, a professor asked me: When Xi Jinping has all the power in his hands, what will he do with it? This professor seemed to think that Mr. Xi might use his authority to guide China toward democracy. But this notion is wishful thinking. For a dictator, power is not a means to an end, power is the end.'b'Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s anticorruption drive has led to the downfall of thousands of corrupt officials, but where are the signs that he will establish a system that safeguards against corruption in the future? Where is the promise that he might subject his own power or that of his cronies to oversight?'b'A leader who stamps on freedom of expression, basks in the praise of a  sycophantic media and fills jails with honest dissenters has no interest in democracy. He is just another dictator. Besides, anticorruption campaigns don\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee real justice. When the government media runs reports about cases that are still under investigation and gloats about how severely corrupt officials are being punished, it seems improbable that the accused will get a proper defense. They may well have committed crimes, but they have rights too, even if they have denied them to others.'b'As deputy director of the Hunan Province justice department, Wan Chuanyou oversaw the surveillance and intimidation of rights lawyers. According to the lawyer Cai Ying, in May 2014 Mr. Wan stopped Mr. Cai several times from meeting with someone accused in a shuanggui investigation.'b'Cai Ying asked him: If one day you are placed under investigation what will you do? Wan Chuanyou answered: How could that possibly happen to me?'b'Five months later, Wan Chuanyou was put under shuanggui.'b''b'\n'b'Murong Xuecun 'b' is a novelist and blogger and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cLeave Me Alone: A Novel of Chengdu.\xe2\x80\x9d This article was translated by Harvey Thomlinson from the Chinese.

But the mystery continued: No charges were cited, nor was there any sign that the Iranian-American reporter would be allowed to consult a lawyer and Western diplomatic officials for his defense.'b'The announcement said only that the case was referred for \xe2\x80\x9cprocessing\xe2\x80\x9d to Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s Revolutionary Court. The development, while far from reassuring, offers an opportunity for judiciary officials to finally introduce an element of fairness into this shameful episode by dismissing all charges against Mr. Rezaian, a widely respected foreign correspondent.'b'In November, Mohammad Javad Larijani, the head of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s human rights council, expressed the hope that the case might soon be dropped, with Mr. Rezaian released in \xe2\x80\x9cless than a month.\xe2\x80\x9d The Iranian leadership should follow through and show that Iran, at a time of delicate international talks about its nuclear program, can demonstrate that it is worthy of greater trust and credibility.'b'There was no justifiable reason for Mr. Rezaian and his wife, the Iranian journalist Yeganeh Salehi, to have been arrested in July.

Everyone who is part of an organization \xe2\x80\x94 a company, a nonprofit, a condo board \xe2\x80\x94 has experienced these and other pathologies that can occur when human beings try to work together in groups.'b'But does teamwork have to be a lost cause? Psychologists have been working on the problem for a long time. And for good reason: Nowadays, though we may still idolize the charismatic leader or creative genius, almost every decision of consequence is made by a group. When Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s board of directors establishes a privacy policy, when the C.I.A.\xe2\x80\x99s operatives strike a suspected terrorist hide-out or when a jury decides whether to convict a defendant, what matters is not just the intelligence and wisdom of the individual actors involved. Groups of smart people can make horrible decisions \xe2\x80\x94 or great ones.'b'Psychologists have known for a century that individuals vary in their cognitive ability. But are some groups, like some people, reliably smarter than others?'b'Working with several colleagues and students, we set out to answer that question. In our first two 'b'studies'b', which we published with Alex Pentland and Nada Hashmi of M.I.T. in 2010 in the journal Science, we grouped 697 volunteer participants into teams of two to five members. Each team worked together to complete a series of short tasks, which were selected to represent the varied kinds of problems that groups are called upon to solve in the real world. One task involved logical analysis, another brainstorming; others emphasized coordination, planning and moral reasoning.'b'Individual intelligence, as psychologists measure it, is defined by its generality: People with good vocabularies, for instance, also tend to have good math skills, even though we often think of those abilities as distinct. The results of our studies showed that this same kind of general intelligence also exists for teams. On average, the groups that did well on one task did well on the others, too. In other words, some teams were simply smarter than others.'b'We next tried to define what characteristics distinguished the smarter teams from the rest, and we were a bit surprised by the answers we got. We gave each volunteer an individual I.Q. test, but teams with higher average I.Q.s didn\xe2\x80\x99t score much higher on our collective intelligence tasks than did teams with lower average I.Q.s. Nor did teams with more extroverted people, or teams whose members reported feeling more motivated to contribute to their group\xe2\x80\x99s success.'b'Instead, the smartest teams were distinguished by three characteristics.'b'First, their members contributed more equally to the team\xe2\x80\x99s discussions, rather than letting one or two people dominate the group.'b'Second, their members scored higher on a test called Reading the Mind in the Eyes, which measures how well people can read complex emotional states from images of faces with only the eyes visible.'b'Finally, teams with more women outperformed teams with more men. Indeed, it appeared that it was not \xe2\x80\x9cdiversity\xe2\x80\x9d (having equal numbers of men and women) that mattered for a team\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence, but simply having more women. This last effect, however, was partly explained by the fact that women, on average, were better at \xe2\x80\x9cmindreading\xe2\x80\x9d than men.'b'In a new 'b'study'b' that we published with David Engel and Lisa X. Jing of M.I.T. last month in PLoS One, we replicated these earlier findings, but with a twist. We randomly assigned each of 68 teams to complete our collective intelligence test in one of two conditions. Half of the teams worked face to face, like the teams in our earlier studies. The other half worked online, with no ability to see any of their teammates. Online collaboration is on the rise, with tools like Skype, Google Drive and old-fashioned email enabling groups that never meet to execute complex projects. We wanted to see whether groups that worked online would still demonstrate collective intelligence, and whether social ability would matter as much when people communicated purely by typing messages into a browser.'b'And they did. Online and off, some teams consistently worked smarter than others. More surprisingly, the most important ingredients for a smart team remained constant regardless of its mode of interaction: members who communicated a lot, participated equally and possessed good emotion-reading skills.'b'This last finding was another surprise. Emotion-reading mattered just as much for the online teams whose members could not see one another as for the teams that worked face to face. What makes teams smart must be not just the ability to read facial expressions, but a more general ability, known as \xe2\x80\x9cTheory of Mind,\xe2\x80\x9d to consider and keep track of what other people feel, know and believe.'b'A new science of effective teamwork is vital not only because teams do so many important things in society, but also because so many teams operate over long periods of time, confronting an ever-widening array of tasks and problems that may be much different from the ones they were initially convened to solve. General intelligence, whether in individuals or teams, is especially crucial for explaining who will do best in novel situations or ones that require learning and adaptation to changing circumstances. We hope that understanding what makes groups smart will help organizations and leaders in all fields create and manage teams more effectively.'b'For the second time in three terms, the Supreme Court has agreed to consider 'b'the constitutionality of same-sex marriage'b'. The last time around, the justices declined to take up the broad question. This time, there is every reason for them to follow the logic of their own rulings over the past 12 years and end the debate once and for all.'b'On Friday, the court accepted four cases from Ohio, Kentucky, Tennessee and Michigan, where same-sex marriage bans were 'b'upheld'b' by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in November. All other federal appeals courts that have ruled on the issue have struck down the bans.'b'Oral arguments are likely to be in late April, but there is little new to be said. Both sides\xe2\x80\x99 positions have been aired out thoroughly and repeatedly for several years.'b'And as usual, the outcome almost certainly lies in the hands of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has authored all three of the court\xe2\x80\x99s previous decisions upholding gay rights. In each case, Mr. Kennedy wrote eloquently of the dignity and equality of gay people. It is hard to see how, given the combined reasoning in those cases, he could now turn back at the threshold of one of the most important civil-rights decisions in a generation.'b'Justice Antonin Scalia, who has voted against constitutional protections for gays and lesbians at every opportunity, foresaw this moment more than a decade ago, when the court 'b'reversed its own precedent'b' and banned state anti-sodomy laws.'b'In the 2003 case of 'b'Lawrence v. Texas'b', Justice Kennedy wrote that the Constitution protects \xe2\x80\x9cadult persons in deciding how to conduct their private lives in matters pertaining to sex.\xe2\x80\x9d The opinion said it was not deciding the question of same-sex marriage, but Mr. Scalia begged to differ. If states may not use laws to express moral disapproval of homosexual conduct, 'b'he wrote in dissent'b', \xe2\x80\x9cwhat justification could there possibly be for denying the benefits of marriage to homosexual couples exercising the liberty protected by the Constitution?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Precisely.'b'In 2013, the court 'b'struck down'b' the core of the federal Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as between a man and a woman \xe2\x80\x94 but again declined to address state bans. Since then, in a 'b'remarkable and nearly unanimous string'b' of more than 40 lower-court rulings around the country, federal and state judges have found that state bans violate the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantees of due process and equal protection.'b'In the process, the arguments against same-sex marriage have been thoroughly dismantled, so the bans\xe2\x80\x99 supporters have grown increasingly desperate to generate new arguments. The latest to take hold is the idea of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'responsible procreation'b'\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, because heterosexual couples can conceive a baby by accident, they need an incentive to get married and raise the child together.'b'Of course, that has nothing to do with the right of same-sex couples to get married. In striking down bans in Indiana and Wisconsin, the federal appellate judge Richard Posner 'b'called'b' the argument \xe2\x80\x9cso full of holes that it cannot be taken seriously.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The 12 years since 2003 have seen enormous social change on this issue. Before the 'b'Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court'b' legalized same-sex marriage in November 2003, no state permitted such marriages. Today, 36 states do, along with the District of Columbia \xe2\x80\x94 representing 'b'more than 70 percent'b' of all Americans. A 'b'solid and growing majority'b' now believes in marriage equality; among those 18 to 29, support is at nearly 80 percent.'b'For same-sex couples and their families, friends and communities, this moment has been a long time coming. The justices have the power and the responsibility to give meaning to the promises embedded in the Constitution, and end the exclusion and inequality of gays and lesbians in America.'b'BELGRADE, Serbia \xe2\x80\x94 At the end of November, a group of young Serbian artists and activists burst into an abandoned cinema in Belgrade called Zvezda. The theater was to be demolished, and the \xe2\x80\x9cMovement for the Occupation of Cinemas\xe2\x80\x9d was determined to save it. Over six weeks later, they\xe2\x80\x99re still there, putting on films and attracting worldwide attention for their stand \xe2\x80\x94 but also raising questions about what, exactly, cinema means in today\xe2\x80\x99s society.'b'Zvezda, whose name means \xe2\x80\x9cStar\xe2\x80\x9d in Serbian, isn\xe2\x80\x99t just any theater. Before it was closed, it was one of the crowning symbols of the propulsive and world-famous Yugoslav film industry. For a time, in the 1960s, Serbian films, led by the so-called Black Wave movement, were some of the most provocative in the world, winning global acclaim for their use of experimental techniques to critique socialist society. International stars flocked to the country, including Richard Burton, Sophia Loren and Orson Welles. The former Yugoslavia was a country in love with the movies, whatever the genre. Josip Broz Tito himself reportedly watched almost 9,000 movies between 1949 and his death in 1980, about 285 a year (he was partial to American Westerns, especially ones starring John Wayne).'b'But while Serbians still go to the movies, the notion of a vibrant national film culture is in the distant past, brought low by the post-socialist, post-Balkan war wave of privatization and globalization of the 2000s. State-owned companies were privatized pell-mell; a Serbian businessman bought 14 cinemas of the once-famous Belgrade Film chain, worth an estimated $80 million, for about $10 million. Most of these and other theaters were converted into more profitable operations like supermarkets, restaurants and nightclubs. Not only did the privatization process transform old-style cinemas into modern multiplexes, but the whole logic of the profit-oriented ideology turned culture into just another commodity.'b'When it looked as if the same fate was about to befall the old Zvezda, the artists and activists got moving. Along with screening classic and new movies \xe2\x80\x94 including a short film made in support of the occupation by the French director Michel Gondry \xe2\x80\x94 the occupiers have used the theater to highlight the painful consequences for culture and civic society of an economy built on austerity and profit above all else.'b'In December they hosted Alexis Tsipras, the leader of the leftist Greek political party Syriza (and perhaps Greece\xe2\x80\x99s next prime minister). \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important to support movements that are fighting against privatization, movements that stand against the attack of neoliberalism,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Tsipras declared.'b'Then an interesting incident happened. The movement is divided into two factions, which identify as \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9capolitical.\xe2\x80\x9d An activist from the latter asked Mr. Tsipras if he was a \xe2\x80\x9cfilm worker\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and, if not, why he was there.'b'Mr. Tsipras answered, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a film worker, but I am here because I am against privatizations and to support you\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 an obvious answer that seemed to be lost on the apoliticals.'b'And here lies the great danger for the occupiers, and anyone else who wants to take a similar stand. There is no barrier between politics and culture, especially in a place like Serbia, where the ideology of political and economic transition, and the inevitable wave of privatization that came with it, has meant the wholesale destruction of old cinemas. To take a stand in defense of culture is in itself to take a political stand (and to nevertheless declare oneself \xe2\x80\x9capolitical\xe2\x80\x9d is itself a political act).'b'The people inside Zvezda now face the same question faced by other recent movements, like Occupy Wall Street: What next? It is not enough just to occupy a space and believe, narcissistically, that the day after will never come.'b'Privatization continues apace in Serbia \xe2\x80\x94 according to some counts, 500 formerly state-held companies will be privatized in 2015. Last year a new, market-friendly labor law was put in place, as was a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. In this moment, these activists must realize that the occupation of a cinema is not only a \xe2\x80\x9ccultural\xe2\x80\x9d action, and it is not something exclusively reserved for \xe2\x80\x9cfilm workers.\xe2\x80\x9d It is much more.'b'To be fair, many people inside Zvezda understand this. I asked Ivan Velisavljevic, one of the members of the Movement for the Occupation of Cinemas, what would come next for the theater. He said that while everyone agreed on the idea that it had to be treated as a common, public space outside the commercial mainstream, there was deep debate over what that would look like. \xe2\x80\x9cIn terms of management, some of the people involved fantasize about worker-owned cooperatives, some about volunteer collectives, and some about a small group of hipsters,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf things around Zvezda don\xe2\x80\x99t fall apart soon, this decision about the type of management will have a crucial consequence: It will be a statement and a clear political act.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words, while we must accept that there is no going back to the days of state-sponsored and state-owned theaters, we must also recognize that the market system is not the only alternative. Self-management is not something that belongs to the museum of failed Yugoslav ideas; if it is reinvented with the awareness that even culture \xe2\x80\x94 together with natural resources, infrastructure or education \xe2\x80\x94 belongs to the commons, it can maybe be a way through the desert of capitalism.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'I Owe It All to Community College'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 14):'b'Tom Hanks\xe2\x80\x99s tribute to Chabot College, one of the 112 California Community Colleges, makes some points worth contemplating as we engage in a national debate about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s initiative to make the first two years at community college free.'b'The California community college system has enabled the community colleges to serve as an open door to a better life for generations of poor and working-class students at a bargain price compared with all other sectors of higher education.'b'Mr. Hanks\xe2\x80\x99s story resonates with those of many of our students who have sought and achieved success.

Their parents have resources and they are not afraid to use them. Their children\xe2\x80\x99s life problems are often outsourced to \xe2\x80\x9cexperts\xe2\x80\x9d for solving. As a result, they never strengthen their own problem-solving abilities to find their own way.'b'Many of these young adults are shocked when they confront their own limitations for the first time in their lives. This disappointment often leads to behavior like excessive drinking and substance abuse. Often, as a result, depression and anxiety soon follow.'b'As it turns out, there are some things that money simply cannot buy.'b'JULI FRAGA'b'\nSan Francisco, Jan. 11, 2015'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'In China, Projects to Make Great Wall Feel Small'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 13):'b'Even a casual reading of this article with its photos and graphic should make Americans wonder about their self-delusion that everything America does is better than the deeds of all other countries.

Our infrastructure is in ruins! The torch has passed to China! Shame on us!'b'NICHOLAS MOLINARI'b'\nBrick, N.J., Jan. 14, 2015'b''b'WHILE the ire of environmental activists remains fixed on the Keystone XL pipeline, a potentially greater threat looms in the proposed expansion of Line 61, a pipeline running the length of Wisconsin carrying tar sands crude. The pipeline is owned by Enbridge, a $40 billion Canadian company, which has been responsible for several hundred spills in the past decade, including one in 2010 near Marshall, Mich., reportedly the largest and most expensive inland oil spill in American history.'b'Enbridge is seeking to increase Line 61\xe2\x80\x99s capacity threefold, making it a third larger than the projected Keystone XL. The last real line of defense against this expansion is an obscure zoning committee in Dane County, Wis., which is scheduled to meet on Jan. 27 to decide whether to attach conditions to Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s permit for a new pump station. Voting to do so would risk a lawsuit from Enbridge, which maintains that the county has no legal right to impose such conditions.'b'While the fight over Keystone XL has involved millions of dollars in advertising, the arrests of many activists outside the White House and the direct engagement of President Obama, Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s plans have received little national attention. This is a glaring example of how environmental policy with transnational impacts can be pushed at the state level without attracting great scrutiny.'b'Line 61, built in 2007, moves 400,000 barrels of tar sands and lighter conventional crude oil a day from Superior, Wis., in the state\xe2\x80\x99s far north, to refineries in Metropolitan Chicago or, through a network of connecting pipelines, to the Gulf Coast. Enbridge wants to increase that, in stages, to 1.2 million barrels per day.'b'Despite this enormous change in capacity, Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Natural Resources has mandated just a single public hearing. That hearing, held last year, was for an air quality permit and was devoted solely to the impact of constructing storage tanks in Superior. The D.N.R. maintains that a 2006 environmental assessment addresses concerns over the safety of Line 61\xe2\x80\x99s expansion.'b'That analysis took place four years before Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s largest spill, in July 2010, which flooded the Kalamazoo River near Marshall with more than 840,000 gallons of tar sands crude and cost the company $1.2 billion to clean up. The cost exceeded the cap on Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s liability insurance by nearly $600 million. (The company paid the difference.)'b'The Marshall spill demonstrated how much more destructive tar sands crude spills are compared with spills of lighter crude. To move through a pipeline, tar sands ore needs to be mixed with chemical solvents. When the spilled mixture was exposed to air, the chemical components, including carcinogenic benzene, separated and released toxic gases, which forced many people to evacuate their homes. Meanwhile, the heavier tar sands sank, which required a destructive dredging of the Kalamazoo River.'b'Although Enbridge completed the cleanup effort last summer, the Environmental Protection Agency asserts that oil remains in the Kalamazoo River. In a scathing 2012 assessment of the Marshall spill, the National Transportation Safety Board, the agency tasked with investigating pipeline accidents, detailed unconscionable lapses in Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s response.'b'Line 61\xe2\x80\x99s opponents are focused on Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s need for new pump stations, which require a conditional use permit from many of the counties in which they are built. Enbridge has secured these permits from each of these counties except Dane.'b'At the meeting on Jan. 27, Dane County\xe2\x80\x99s five-member Zoning and Land Regulation Committee is scheduled to vote on Enbridge\xe2\x80\x99s permit. The committee is considering whether to require Enbridge to carry a more comprehensive \xe2\x80\x94 and expensive \xe2\x80\x94 kind of liability insurance than it had during the Marshall spill. While county governments cannot override federal or state law, there is some precedent for attaching financial requirements to permits.'b'Opponents believe that if Enbridge is forced to buy insurance to cover a Marshall-size spill, the price of expansion could become too onerous. In November, however, three lawyers representing Enbridge met privately with a few county officials, including Patrick Miles, the chairman of Dane County\xe2\x80\x99s zoning committee, and presented a white paper outlining the company\xe2\x80\x99s position that the county does not have the legal right to attach insurance requirements to its permit. Mr. Miles said the implication was clear: The company would sue if need be.'b'Since the Marshall spill, the company has built a new command center in Edmonton and invested $4 billion dollars in maintenance, emergency response and other safety improvements. Despite all this, 4,000 gallons of tar sands crude spilled last January from the Alberta Clipper, the pipeline feeding Line 61.'b'Even with the dropping price of oil, Enbridge remains committed to Line 61\xe2\x80\x99s expansion. Local officials like Mr. Miles have limited legal and financial means to challenge companies such as Enbridge. A more effective approach would be a policy, coordinated between the governments of Canada and the United States, that assessed the cumulative effects of new pipelines and tar sands production on the environment. But given the current political climate, such an agreement is unlikely anytime soon.'b'Dane County\xe2\x80\x99s principled concerns over Line 61\xe2\x80\x99s expansion suggest an alternative, if imperfect, model. If a majority of the committee votes to attach conditions to the county\xe2\x80\x99s permit, and they prevail in any court battle, their victory would provide an important precedent to local governments across the country. Even if they lose, they will have helped raise public awareness about the high costs, both local and planetary, endemic to tar sands crude.'b'Exploding sliders. Time-stopping change-ups. Three-thousand-hit machines. We expect to embrace such superlatives with any baseball Hall of Fame induction class, and 2015 was no different.'b'I had the distinct pleasure \xe2\x80\x94 or pain \xe2\x80\x94 to have played against this class. Craig Biggio was the leadoff hitter I tried to be. Pedro Martinez had so many overwhelming pitches, he could have won as many games by using just one of them. John Smoltz, as a starter, already had the power arm and the invisible slider, and later had the nerve to add some sort of split-fingered fastball to close out games by erasing his opponents.'b'And then there was Randy Johnson.'b'Nearly 7 feet tall, with shoulder-length hair, Johnson was granted more unnecessary height by standing on top of a mound. I recall stepping into the batter\xe2\x80\x99s box against him and wondering if I was standing under an active volcano. (I once trekked the base of the volcano Arenal in Costa Rica and later thought of Johnson \xe2\x80\x94 in both situations I could imagine the explosion, and how I had nowhere to run.)'b'In Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s case, the explosion came out of his left hand. It was not just his 100-mile-per-hour fastball, it was the angle from which he threw it. He slung it from the side, whipping his arm through the air \xe2\x80\x94 with his wingspan, he could practically high-five the first baseman en route. His height, combined with his sound-breaking velocity, made it feel as if he was handing the ball to the catcher after stepping on your front foot for good measure. You simply had no time to see the ball and then hit it. You had to predict its trajectory and try to anticipate where it might end up \xe2\x80\xa6 and hope.'b'That was just his fastball. His slider angered the gods by defining its own gravity. He was notorious for getting a batter to swing and still somehow get hit by the ball. And he could do this to a rookie or to a Hall of Famer. Between his unorthodox arm angle and the sweeping spin on the ball, it was a tsunami of unhittable chaos.'b'To hit him at all took extrasensory wisdom. Just as you can\xe2\x80\x99t climb Mount Everest blindly without expert advice or a Sherpa at your side, you rarely could neutralize Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s work by guessing. You had to have a plan, find a pattern, look for a tip and rely on the basic construct that you get three strikes and therefore three chances to pry victory from his hands.'b'He forced you to travel ahead in time, and tap your inner forecasting ability in a desperate effort to be a step ahead of him. You knew you were going to be in the midst of a thunderstorm when he pitched, but you were looking for where to put the lightning rods so you at least could focus on the tall order of just putting the ball in play, and not your basic safety. I eventually learned, over 43 plate appearances against him, that he liked to throw that slider over the plate on the first pitch when a runner was in scoring position. It took a few games for my plan to finally hatch in a way that I did some damage (by knocking in two runs in one swing). And then, no sooner did I start to feel like the lightning thief, he adjusted, as all great players do.'b'Whenever he pitched it was a performance, and throughout the performance there was no smile, no ray of light peeking through the clouds to give you a sense that he was having fun or that he could be appeased into having mercy. He was on the hill to eradicate your opportunity, to squash the puerile idea that the sun would come out tomorrow. He barked, he cursed himself if necessary, and he competed with anyone and everyone around him to the bitter end.'b'In one game when he was pitching, words were exchanged between our clubs, putting him in a position to have to defend his teammates. In baseball, that usually means the pitcher will hit the next batter. On this day, I was the next batter. As I watched him jawing at our dugout, I wondered whether this would be the last at-bat of my career, or life. Then I thought: he must know that he could kill someone with his fastball, and being that good and accurate, he would also be responsible. And, thankfully, he was. But I had absolutely no confidence that I could have gotten out of the way had he thrown at me.'b'Yet, over the course of my career, I had a few days in the sun when the Big Unit took the mound. I hit .293 against him and even homered off him one magical day in Philadelphia. But as many hits as I got, I had just as many strolls back to the dugout after striking out.'b'In a strange way, I want to thank these great players, Johnson included. They were the best, but what gets lost sometimes is how much their greatness rubbed off on everyone. When you played against them, you knew you belonged. And if you ever beat them \xe2\x80\x94 one on one \xe2\x80\x94 that could inspire you to overcome anything, on the field or even after your baseball career was over.'b'One spring training early in my career, my manager with the Cubs told me to look at the lineup for the next day. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are starting,\xe2\x80\x9d he said matter of factly. And Randy Johnson was pitching for the Mariners. I was not even a major league player at this time.'b'Johnson was returning from a back injury and regaining his strength. Even so, I could barely sleep the night before. But I hit a triple off him. It did not help anyone\xe2\x80\x99s fantasy team, it did not go in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Baseball Encyclopedia,\xe2\x80\x9d no champagne was popped, no national media outlet noticed, but that hit was one of the most important in my career. Because at a young age, I had a tangible baseball result to go with my faith in my ability.'b'And so even though stars like Johnson, Martinez, Smoltz and Biggio steamrolled opponents during their careers, some of the players they left in their wake might have reached their greatest heights from a small victory against them. It mattered, and it will stay with them for all time.'b'So next time you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a player to cut from your fantasy team, or notice that another one has retired in quiet anonymity, go back and look through their career. You might find a game when they beat one of the best players of our era, a moment that maybe bought them more years in a major league uniform than projected \xe2\x80\x94 or in any case gave them the courage to take that extra step in the darkest of circumstances. (Just one example: the game in 2000 when the Mets\xe2\x80\x99 slight of build, unassuming \xe2\x80\x9cSuper\xe2\x80\x9d Joe McEwing went 3 for 4 against Johnson, with two doubles and a home run.)'b'These players may be the best compliment to those enshrined in the Hall of Fame because they remind us that true greatness means more than a chain of personal bests. It also means bringing out the best in others \xe2\x80\x94 teammates and, maybe even more so, opponents.'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously corrupt and violent Rikers Island jail complex got that way after city officials let the correction officers\xe2\x80\x99 union run the complex as it saw fit. The result was a system in which guards could beat up inmates for minor offenses, like talking back, without fear of being held accountable.'b'One might think that young officers became hardened in a workplace where sadistic behavior was the norm. But a 'b'report released this week'b' by New York City\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Investigation lays bare another horrendous problem: The jails fell into the habit of hiring guards who had criminal histories or were otherwise unfit for the job.'b'The Department of Investigation reviewed the applications of 153 people hired by the Correction Department in 2014. The'b' investigators found'b' that more than one-third had records that should have either disqualified them or prompted closer scrutiny of their backgrounds. Ten had been arrested more than once, and 12 had previously been rejected by the New York Police Department, six of them for \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Additionally, 79 had relatives or friends who were current or former inmates, which investigators viewed as a potential corruption threat. According to the report, the Department of Correction has only recently developed a legitimate process for screening out applicants who have had a \xe2\x80\x9cgang affiliation\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 which generally means the person has had a close relationship with gang members or has in some way participated in their activities. This poses an enormous problem, the report noted, because gang members generally place gang allegiance ahead of their duties as officers.'b'The report said that over the last year, 23 Rikers Island staff members accused of excessive force, smuggling of contraband, or falsification of documents or evidence had been arrested or referred for discipline.'b'While the Correction Department has started to improve the screening process, the report noted, its intelligence bureau still estimates that there are dozens of gang-affiliated people on the staff. All of the officers described in the report were hired before the current correction commissioner, Joseph Ponte, entered office last April.'b'Mr. Ponte said this week that he planned to carry out full investigations of the people whose cases were cited in the report. He also plans to adopt strict employment standards and create a training program for staff members who are involved in the hiring process. As Mark Peters, the Department of Investigation commissioner, noted, the lawlessness at Rikers cannot be fixed unless the jail complex completely reforms the way it selects the guards who run the place.'b'From the time she was 3 years old until she turned 21, Krystle Jackson lived in 13 different foster homes. So she was distraught when her own young children, Kayla and Isaiah, landed in foster care in 2012 when her daughter was seriously hurt while Ms. Jackson was at a job-training class. She fought hard to get her children back, working with New Alternatives for Children\xe2\x80\x99s foster care program to meet the necessary requirements. She attended parenting class, kept appointments with the children twice a week and participated in therapy. In early 2014, she was reunited with Kayla and Isaiah.'b'That was a triumph, but while Ms. Jackson, 29, earns some money braiding hair and babysitting, she lacks a full-time job and makes ends meet with public assistance. A social worker who visited her apartment, which is subsidized by the New York City Housing Authority, noticed that the living room did not have a couch or a table or a place to store the children\xe2\x80\x99s belongings. The social worker told Ms. Jackson about the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, which is supported by the Neediest Cases Fund.

So let me fill you in.'b'Rickford spent the first two days of his trip in Washington, where of course debate over the controversial Keystone XL pipeline is underway in earnest in the new Republican-led Senate. The Republican-led House, meanwhile, has already passed a bill giving the go-ahead to the pipeline, which, if it\xe2\x80\x99s ever built, will transport heavy crude from the tar sands of Alberta to American refineries in the Gulf of Mexico. And of course President Obama has threatened to veto any such bill, should one land on his desk.'b'In Washington, Rickford met with his Obama administration counterpart, Ernest Moniz, the secretary of energy. Although the Keystone pipeline was not on the agenda, the two men talked about it anyway. Rickford paid a visit to Heidi Heitkamp, the Democratic senator from North Dakota, who strongly supports the Keystone pipeline. (In addition to the Alberta crude, the pipeline would transport shale oil from North Dakota.)'b'He met with State Department officials to get a Keystone update; because the pipeline would cross the U.S.-Canada border, the department has to do a review, which it has done several times, always coming down in favor of the project. In several speeches, Rickford talked up the close energy relationship between the United States and Canada, noting that Canada sends three million barrels per day to America \xe2\x80\x94 more than Venezuela and Saudi Arabia combined. He mentioned Canada\xe2\x80\x99s new 'b'pipeline safety law'b'. He said he thought the Keystone XL pipeline should be approved, which is essentially what Canadian officials have been saying for the past six years.'b'Then on Wednesday, Rickford went to Texas for two days. This is the part of his trip that really caught my attention. His main focus in Texas was on two new Canadian-controlled pipelines that became operational in mid-December. One is called the Flanagan South pipeline, which cost $2.8 billion. It covers nearly 600 miles, from Pontiac, Ill., to Cushing, Okla. The other pipeline, called the Seaway Twin, runs an additional 500 miles, from Cushing to Freeport, Tex., where the refineries are. It cost $1.2 billion. Guess where some of the oil that is going to run through those pipelines is coming from? Yep \xe2\x80\x94 the tar sands of Alberta.'b'If you are wondering why the environmental community hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been chaining itself to the White House fence to protest these two new pipelines, the way it has with Keystone, the answer is that neither of these pipelines crosses the Canadian border, so they don\xe2\x80\x99t require the same complicated approval process that Keystone requires. (The Flanagan South line will connect with a pipeline that already crosses the border.) More to the point, perhaps, they were never the symbol that the high-profile Keystone XL became, so that even the approvals they did require never aroused the same attention from environmentalists.'b'Yet these new pipelines are going to be carrying some 200,000 barrels per day of the heavy crude mined from the tar sands. True, that is only a third of what the Keystone XL would be able to deliver, but it essentially helps double the amount of tar sands oil that can be exported to the United States. In addition, there will be expanded 'b'rail capacity for Alberta\xe2\x80\x99s oil'b', which is a far more dangerous way to move it than a state-of-the-art pipeline.'b'The point is: With or without Keystone, 'b'Canada\xe2\x80\x99s tar sands oil is coming'b' to the United States. One of the stated reasons that environmental activists wanted to prevent Keystone from being built was that doing so would force Canada to stop mining the oil. Without Keystone, it was said, Canada would have no means to export it. But that has never been a particularly plausible argument. Even before the opening of these two new pipelines, tar sands oil was coming to the United States, primarily by rail. Indeed, the only thing that can slow it down now is the rapid drop in the price of oil, which is likely to make expensive tar sands crude unprofitable.'b'Even as the Keystone debate reaches its current crescendo, all that is left, really, is the symbolism. The Republican right claims that Keystone will create jobs. 'b'It won\xe2\x80\x99t'b', not to any significant degree. The Democratic left says that the oil Keystone will bring to the Gulf is so dirty, so carbon laden, that it will wreak havoc on the climate. It won\xe2\x80\x99t do that either. If the president ultimately decides not to approve Keystone, he will do so knowing full well that he has not stopped the tar sands oil in any meaningful way.'b'To expect another outcome is, well, a pipe dream. It always was.'b'Rick Perry!'b'The man who has been governor of Texas since pterodactyls roamed the plains took his leave at the State Capitol this week. He is not saying anything for sure about running for president. Mum\xe2\x80\x99s the word until springtime. However, 'b'he recently told a reporter'b' that if voters want to break from the Obama era, \xe2\x80\x9cI am a very clear and compelling individual to support.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Wow, the Republican race is getting to be like one of those crime shows where the detectives have to paste pictures all over the wall so they can keep the suspects straight. So many old friends popping up this month \xe2\x80\x94 Mitt Romney and now Rick Perry. The man who drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the car roof and the man who claims he shot a coyote while jogging. The animal lobby had better get out there and see how Jeb Bush feels about wolf hunting.'b'Almost everybody has a Rick Perry favorite moment. For 99 percent, it\xe2\x80\x99s probably the dreaded \xe2\x80\x9coops\xe2\x80\x9d debate when he announced that as president he was going to shutter three federal agencies \xe2\x80\x94 and then could only think of two.'b'And, yeah, that one was pretty good. However, I still cherish a television interview Perry did a few years earlier with Evan Smith of The Texas Tribune in which he defended abstinence-only sex education despite the state\xe2\x80\x99s astronomical rates of teenage pregnancy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt works,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry said defiantly and totally erroneously.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCan you give me a statistic suggesting it works?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Smith.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell you from my own personal life. Abstinence works,\xe2\x80\x9d Perry replied. Smith was too discreet to press for details, but let\xe2\x80\x99s hope it comes up during the campaign.'b'Perry had been governor of Texas for more than 14 years, an all-time record. In his farewell speech to the State Legislature, he reminded the lawmakers of all they\xe2\x80\x99d been through together, including hurricanes, wildfires and the tragic disintegration of the Space Shuttle Columbia over Texas in 2003, although Perry called it \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Shuttle Challenger,\xe2\x80\x9d which blew up in 1986.'b'No mention of his pending felony indictment for abuse of power. Perry tried to force a county district attorney to resign by threatening to veto the money for an office she runs that investigates public corruption. It\xe2\x80\x99s a complicated story. First you learn that the D.A. in question had been arrested in a rather spectacular drunken-driving case, and you tilt a little toward Perry. Then you discover that two other county D.A.\xe2\x80\x99s were charged with drunken driving during the Perry administration without attracting the wrath of the governor. Then you sort of get distracted by wondering what\xe2\x80\x99s going on with Texas district attorneys.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve got ages to work it out.'b'Perry bragged about the state\xe2\x80\x99s economy, which he often refers to as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Texas Miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d Really, we have not heard so much about miracles since Our Lady of Fatima. The state\xe2\x80\x99s record of job creation is his big calling card to the presidential league, and once he starts harping on it again we\xe2\x80\x99re going to wonder: Has Texas been growing so many jobs because Perry cut taxes and regulations? Or is it because Texas happens to be a state with warm weather, lots of space for cheap housing, a huge border with Mexico and massive oil and gas deposits? Is Perry a great leader or just conveniently located? Eventually, someone will repeat the old joke about being born on third base and thinking you hit a triple.'b'Perry\xe2\x80\x99s signature job-building initiative is something called the Texas Enterprise Fund, which aims to persuade out-of-state companies to move to Texas, or expand there. One of its beneficiaries, Texas Institute for Genomic Medicine, got $50 million in return for creating what Perry said were more than 12,000 jobs. An investigation by The Wall Street Journal revealed the fund folk had been counting every single biotech job created anywhere in the state for the previous six years. Actually the number was more like 10.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s great that the governor\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions are forcing us to think a lot about Texas, a state that deserves more attention, having been home to only three of the last eight elected chief executives. Not even half! And although lawmakers from Texas currently lead six of the committees in the House of Representatives, that\xe2\x80\x99s still under a third.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also United States Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, making all the pre-presidential-campaign stops and offering an option to all of us who are yearning for a vision to the right of Rick Perry. I once threw out the possibility of an entire Republican ticket from the Lone Star State, and many readers desperately wrote to argue that that was unconstitutional. It might be fairer to say that the Constitution isn\xe2\x80\x99t crazy about the idea.'b'We can figure that out down the line. Meanwhile, Perry and Cruz could both be in the presidential debates. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see who\xe2\x80\x99s better at counting to three.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'TWO months ago, the British Psychological Society released a remarkable document entitled 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstanding Psychosis and Schizophrenia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Its authors say that hearing voices and feeling paranoid are common experiences, and are often a reaction to trauma, abuse or deprivation: \xe2\x80\x9cCalling them symptoms of mental illness, psychosis or schizophrenia is only one way of thinking about them, with advantages and disadvantages.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report says that there is no strict dividing line between psychosis and normal experience: \xe2\x80\x9cSome people find it useful to think of themselves as having an illness. Others prefer to think of their problems as, for example, an aspect of their personality which sometimes gets them into trouble but which they would not want to be without.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report adds that antipsychotic medications are sometimes helpful, but that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no evidence that it corrects an underlying biological abnormality.\xe2\x80\x9d It then warns about the risk of taking these drugs for years.'b'And the report says that it is \xe2\x80\x9cvital\xe2\x80\x9d that those who suffer with distressing symptoms be given an opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9ctalk in detail about their experiences and to make sense of what has happened to them\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and points out that mental health services rarely make such opportunities available.'b'This is a radically different vision of severe mental illness from the one held by most Americans, and indeed many American psychiatrists. Americans think of schizophrenia as a brain disorder that can be treated only with medication. Yet there is plenty of scientific evidence for the report\xe2\x80\x99s claims.'b'Moreover, the perspective is surprisingly consonant \xe2\x80\x94 in some ways \xe2\x80\x94 with the new approach by our own 'b'National Institute of Mental Health'b', which funds much of the research on mental illness in this country. For decades, American psychiatric science took diagnosis to be fundamental. These categories \xe2\x80\x94 depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder \xe2\x80\x94 were assumed to represent biologically distinct diseases, and the goal of the research was to figure out the biology of the disease.'b'That didn\xe2\x80\x99t pan out. In 2013, the institute\xe2\x80\x99s director, Thomas R. Insel, 'b'announced'b' that psychiatric science had failed to find unique biological mechanisms associated with specific diagnoses. What genetic underpinnings or neural circuits they had identified were mostly common across diagnostic groups. Diagnoses were neither particularly useful nor accurate for understanding the brain, and would no longer be used to guide research.'b'And so the institute has begun one of the most interesting and radical experiments in scientific research in years. It jettisoned a decades-long tradition of diagnosis-driven research, in which a scientist became, for example, a schizophrenia researcher. Under a program called 'b'Research Domain Criteria'b', all research must begin from a matrix of neuroscientific structures (genes, cells, circuits) that cut across behavioral, cognitive and social domains (acute fear, loss, arousal). To use an example from the program\xe2\x80\x99s website, psychiatric researchers will no longer study people with anxiety; they will study fear circuitry.'b'Our current diagnostic system \xe2\x80\x94 the main achievement of the biomedical revolution in psychiatry \xe2\x80\x94 drew a sharp , clear line between those who were sick and those who were well, and that line was determined by science. The system started with the behavior of persons, and sorted them into types. That approach sank deep roots into our culture, possibly because sorting ourselves into different kinds of people comes naturally to us.'b'The institute is rejecting this system because it does not lead to useful research. It is starting afresh, with a focus on how the brain and its trillions of synaptic connections work. The British Psychological Society rejects the centrality of diagnosis for seemingly quite different reasons \xe2\x80\x94 among them, because defining people by a devastating label may not help them.'b'Both approaches recognize that mental illnesses are complex individual responses \xe2\x80\x94 less like hypothyroidism, in which you fall ill because your body does not secrete enough thyroid hormone, and more like metabolic syndrome, in which a collection of unrelated risk factors (high blood pressure, body fat around the waist) increases your chance of heart disease.'b'The implications are that social experience plays a significant role in who becomes mentally ill, when they fall ill and how their illness unfolds. We should view illness as caused not only by brain deficits but also by abuse, deprivation and inequality, which alter the way brains behave. Illness thus requires social interventions, not just pharmacological ones.'b'ONE outcome of this rethinking could be that talk therapy will regain some of the importance it lost when the new diagnostic system was young. And we know how to do talk therapy. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out medication: while there may be problems with the long-term use of antipsychotics, many people find them useful when their symptoms are severe.'b'The rethinking comes at a time of disconcerting awareness that mental health problems are far more pervasive than we might have imagined. The World Health Organization estimates that one in four people will have an episode of mental illness in their lifetime. Mental and behavioral problems are the biggest single cause of disability on the planet. But in low- and middle-income countries, about four of five of those disabled by the illnesses do not receive treatment for them.'b'When the United Nations sets its new Sustainable Development Goals this spring, it should include mental illness, along with diseases like AIDS and malaria, as scourges to be combated. There is much we still do not know about mental illness, and much we can do to improve its care. But we know enough to do something, and to accept that knowing more and doing more should be a fundamental commitment.'b'Howard S.

One of the big changes that happened that\xe2\x80\x99s very interesting is that many more people in Paris had dogs and cats as pets. So many people lived alone.'b''b'LISTENING'b' I generally listen to jazz, mostly from either the era of big bands or small groups led by 'b'Stan Getz'b' and 'b'Miles Davis'b'.

So I\xe2\x80\x99ve been watching the unending coverage of Charlie Hebdo. My wife and I go to France every September, October and November. I have friends in academia there, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t teach as a rule. It\xe2\x80\x99s against the law to teach and get paid in France after age 70. Besides, French students are just very hard to teach. Even French professors complain about it. They never say a word; never ask a question.

Slowly but surely, though, the crowd was drawn in by the Scheherazade skills of the \xe2\x80\x9cSelma\xe2\x80\x9d director, Ava DuVernay.'b'The horrific scene of the four schoolgirls killed in the white supremacist bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., church stunned the audience. One young man next to me unleashed a string of expletives and admitted that he was scared. When civil rights leaders are clubbed, whipped and trampled by white lawmen as feral white onlookers cheer, the youngsters seemed aghast.'b'In a delicately wrought scene in which Coretta Scott King calls out her husband about his infidelities, some of the teenage girls reacted with a chorus of \xe2\x80\x9coooohs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'DuVernay sets the tone for her portrayal of Lyndon Johnson as patronizing and skittish on civil rights in the first scene between the president and Dr. King. L.B.J. stands above a seated M.L.K., pats him on the shoulder, and tells him \xe2\x80\x9cthis voting thing is just going to have to wait\xe2\x80\x9d while he works on \xe2\x80\x9cthe eradication of poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many of the teenagers by me bristled at the power dynamic between the men. It was clear that a generation of young moviegoers would now see L.B.J.\xe2\x80\x99s role in civil rights through DuVernay\xe2\x80\x99s lens.'b'And that\xe2\x80\x99s a shame. I loved the movie and find the Oscar snub of its dazzling actors repugnant. But the director\xe2\x80\x99s talent makes her distortion of L.B.J. more egregious. Artful falsehood is more dangerous than artless falsehood, because fewer people see through it.'b''b'DuVernay told Rolling Stone'b' that, originally, the script was more centered on the L.B.J.-M.L.K. relationship and was \xe2\x80\x9cmuch more slanted to Johnson.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t interested in making a white-savior movie,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Hollywood has done that with films like \xe2\x80\x9cMississippi Burning,\xe2\x80\x9d which cast white F.B.I. agents as the heroes, or \xe2\x80\x9cCry Freedom,\xe2\x80\x9d which made a white journalist the focus rather Denzel Washington\xe2\x80\x99s anti-apartheid activist, Steve Biko.'b'Instead of painting L.B.J. and M.L.K. as allies, employing different tactics but complementing each other, the director made Johnson an obstacle.'b'Top Johnson aide Jack Valenti told Michael Beschloss, the presidential historian, that L.B.J. aspired to pass a Voting Rights Act from his first night as president. Valenti said that his boss talked to him about it the night of J.F.K.\xe2\x80\x99s assassination in the bedroom of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s house in D.C., The Elms, before the newly sworn-in president went to sleep.'b'On the tape of a phone conversation between President Johnson and Dr. King the week of L.B.J.\xe2\x80\x99s 1965 inauguration, the president said that he indicated the time was not yet ripe to ask Congress for it, and he made it clear that they both needed to think of something that would move public opinion more than a presidential speech.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJohnson was probably thinking, at least in part, of the spring of \xe2\x80\x9963, when J.F.K. was privately saying the public wasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet politically ready for a comprehensive civil rights bill,\xe2\x80\x9d Beschloss said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen came the May 1963 photograph of Birmingham police setting dogs against African-American demonstrators, which helped to move many white Americans who were on the fence about the issue.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnce Selma happened, L.B.J. was, of course, horrified, but he knew that the atrocity would have an effect on white Americans similar to Birmingham that would make it easier for him to get a Voting Rights Act from Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an interview with Gwen Ifill on P.B.S., DuVernay dismissed the criticism by Joseph Califano Jr. and other L.B.J. loyalists, who said that the president did not resist the Selma march or let J. Edgar Hoover send a sex tape of her husband to Mrs. King. (Bobby Kennedy, as J.F.K\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, is the one who allowed Hoover to tap Dr. King.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is art; this is a movie; this is a film,\xe2\x80\x9d DuVernay said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a historian.

Filmmakers love to talk about their artistic license to distort the truth, even as they bank on the authenticity of their films to boost them at awards season.'b'John Lewis, the Georgia congressman who was badly beaten in Selma, has said that bridge led to the Obama White House. And, on Friday night, the president offset the Oscar dis by screening \xe2\x80\x9cSelma\xe2\x80\x9d at the White House. Guests included DuVernay, Lewis and Oprah Winfrey, who acts in the film and was one of its producers.'b'There was no need for DuVernay to diminish L.B.J., given that the Civil Rights Movement would not have advanced without him.

There was no need to create a faux one.'b'SOUTH GATE, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 A FEW weeks ago, the City Council in this suburb southeast of Los Angeles appointed a Mexican immigrant to its advisory council. Jesus Miranda is from Michoac\xc3\xa1n and owns a taco restaurant here. He\xe2\x80\x99ll advise the council on housing development and other issues.'b'Mr. Miranda\xe2\x80\x99s appointment is hardly national news. But small moments like these are signs of a historic change of heart toward America and civic engagement among Mexican immigrants, many of whom, like Mr. Miranda, have been here for decades. No place offers a clearer view of this change than the suburbs southeast of Los Angeles.'b'South Gate (pop. 96,000) and its neighbors were mostly farmland until the 1930s, when migrants from the Midwest and later World War II veterans moved to work in the factories of Chrysler, G.M., Firestone and Bethlehem Steel. Subdivisions sprouted. Towns emerged with bucolic names: Maywood, Huntington Park, Bell Gardens. Union jobs sustained a civic ecosystem of local newspapers, Rotary Clubs and Fourth of July parades.'b'Then, in the late 1970s, the factories started leaving, and so did the white people. Their civic institutions atrophied. By 1990, towns like South Gate that had been 90 percent white were more than 90 percent Latino.'b'The new residents, crucially, were not from East Los Angeles, where Mexican-Americans had developed an activist political tradition since the 1960s. Instead, they were Mexican, straight from the ranchos \xe2\x80\x94 small villages on Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s frontiers, far from the center and from government. Most came here to work in jobs they believed, even after decades, would be temporary. They focused their lives on returning home someday. They packed into cheap housing and spent their savings on building homes back in Mexico.'b'Mexican rancho culture valued self-reliance and hard work. But rancheros also shunned politics, and, in particular, the paternalistic embrace of the PRI, the party that ran Mexico like Tammany Hall for 71 years. Immigrants brought that history with them, and in the dense southeast enclaves, their attitudes didn\xe2\x80\x99t change.'b'This tradition of non-engagement, combined with Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s proximity to California, meant that this wave of immigrants was fundamentally different from previous groups in other parts of the country.'b'Arriving in the United States, the Irish in Chicago, Italians in New York and Cubans in Miami came for good. They wedged their way into big cities using politics as the crowbar to more economic opportunity, and jobs in government. They had to compete with, and learn from, established groups and elites.'b'This was not the case for Mexicans in the California suburbs. As the region morphed into a service economy, they easily found work. In 1986, Congress passed legislation granting amnesty to around 800,000 immigrants in Los Angeles County, many of whom eventually acquired citizenship. Suddenly many residents were voters, yet without any tradition of informed franchise or accountability. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, those who lived out in these Los Angeles suburbs had no one to show them a way to civic engagement. Not many had the education, or English, necessary to run a California municipality. Caring little for politics, they avoided city hall and rarely participated in civic institutions.'b'In this vacuum, beginning in the mid-1990s, an astonishing cast of scoundrels was voted into office by immigrants casting the first votes of their lives.'b'In South Gate, an unhinged brand of politics mutated, based on anonymous fliers. In 1999, one council candidate was accused, in a fake newspaper article reprinted in an anonymous flier, of molesting two boys. In 2001, anonymous fliers mailed to voters falsely claimed that two councilmen had fathered children they later abandoned. Tapping immigrants\xe2\x80\x99 deep connection to Mexico, fliers, in Spanish and English, accused candidates of being related to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the disgraced ex-president of Mexico, and of belonging to the PRI.'b'These fliers seem clownish, but immigrant voters believed them.'b'The council majority that won power paid voters back with classic PRI-style giveaways: free hot dogs and sodas at first, and then toys one Christmas. Once in power, it was police badges to cronies and millions of dollars to law firms.'b'Eventually, enough voters woke up. Ashamed they\xe2\x80\x99d been duped, they recalled the treasurer and his cronies in 2003. The treasurer was later prosecuted and sent to federal prison. South Gate, however, was on the brink of bankruptcy.'b'Most southeast towns, stripped of their civic girdings, have gone through similarly toxic municipal episodes.'b'Mar\xc3\xada Chac\xc3\xb3n, an immigrant from Chihuahua who ran Bell Gardens'b' 'b'(pop. 42,000)'b' 'b'like a Mexican cacique, or political boss, was convicted of conflict of interest for engineering her appointment as city manager.'b'The town of Cudahy hired a former janitor as city manager, and an opposing candidate had a Molotov cocktail thrown at his house.'b'In Bell (pop. 36,000), the city manager voted himself and others annual salaries well above that earned by the president of the United States. He and his former assistant are now in prison. Five southeast suburbs, in fact, had at least one elected official go to prison in the last dozen years.'b'But each boil of corruption, once lanced, left its respective town a little cleaner, more chastened.'b'Today, a virtually secured border has significantly slowed the flow of new immigrants who kept ranchero political culture alive. Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s recent medieval violence has also terrified many of those who are already here into staying put.'b'As a result, many Mexican immigrants no longer cling to the dream of returning home one day. This change is happening across the United States \xe2\x80\x94 from Idaho to North Carolina \xe2\x80\x94 but it is most palpable in these Mexican immigrant enclaves of Los Angeles County.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI get the sense that folks now see this as home,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jorge Morales, a South Gate city councilman and son of Mexican immigrants. \xe2\x80\x9cMy parents always talked about going back to Mexico. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s a place they\xe2\x80\x99ll visit, but this is home.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last summer, a shopping center opened in South Gate. It was to be called El Portal (The Gateway), but a market survey found that people in an area that is more than 90 percent Latino wanted no Latino theme to the center. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat people wanted was something like they saw on the West Side\xe2\x80\x9d of Los Angeles, which is predominately white, said Councilman Morales.'b' 'b''b'The Azalea Regional Shopping Center, as it was named instead, held a Christmas-tree-lighting ceremony last month, at which members of South Gate\xe2\x80\x99s Girl Scout Troop 16325, Latinas all, sang \xe2\x80\x9cJingle Bells\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No Girl Scout troop had existed in South Gate for some three decades. But two years ago, a local mother got fed up with driving her daughter two towns over and formed her own troop. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are getting involved, coming out of their shells,\xe2\x80\x9d Daisy Prieto, the volunteer troop leader, and daughter of Mexican immigrants, told me.'b'St. Helen Catholic Church for years held toy drives for orphanages in Tijuana. This year, the drive benefited needy kids in South Gate.'b'MEANWHILE, immigrants like Mr. Miranda have learned to use city hall, and local government has become significantly more professional since the days of rancid fliers and giveaways. At a recent meeting, the City Council took up mundane but essential municipal issues: purchasing a diesel flatbed truck, zoning for emergency homeless shelters and appointments to its advisory council. The town\xe2\x80\x99s advisory councils'b' 'b'are populated by a healthy mix of white and black, as well as Latino.'b'South Gate\xe2\x80\x99s experience stands as a template for hundreds of small towns in Tennessee, the Carolinas, Kansas and elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 towns that have been rejuvenated by new Mexican workers, who now form their essential working classes, yet remain civically absent.'b'When I started reporting on the southeast suburbs in the 1990s, they felt to me like one enormous Mexican rancho \xe2\x80\x94 the way the Lower East Side of Manhattan must have once seemed a big shtetl. Today, they feel like an iceberg finally separating and floating away from mother Mexico. People are more focused on how things run where they raise children than in villages they\xe2\x80\x99ll never return to.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s taken a long time. But it is a good thing for Mexican immigrants and for the small American towns where so many have landed.'b''b' 'b''b'The obsession among House conservatives to hobble the Internal Revenue Service is about to pay off this tax season in foolhardy budget cuts to the agency that will cost the government an estimated $2 billion in lost revenue.'b'That works out to about $6 in lost taxes for every $1 in cuts Congress made in reducing the I.R.S. budget another 3 percent this year, according to the Treasury Department.'b'The slashed budget is a victory for penny-wise-and-pound-foolish politicians. It amounts to payback demanded by House Republicans to penalize the I.R.S. for daring to scrutinize Tea Party operations that tried to claim exemptions under the tax code for nonpolitical groups.

This is no way to treat responsible citizens willing to pay their taxes.'b'Ms. Olson 'b'warned last week'b' that the cumulative 17 percent in budget cuts over the last five years has already caused a \xe2\x80\x9cdevastating erosion\xe2\x80\x9d of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s operations. If more resources are cut, that will only encourage taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 noncompliance. The agency\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 $10.9 billion budget is about the same as in 1998, when the I.R.S. had 30 million fewer returns to process.'b'While the agency deals with 200 million Americans \xe2\x80\x94 three times as many as any other agency \xe2\x80\x94 its work force has been cut by 12,000, to 83,000, in the last four years. As many as 4,000 more jobs may have to be cut this year, even with a two-day work furlough possible, according to John Koskinen, the I.R.S. commissioner. The agency\xe2\x80\x99s walk-in services are a thing of the past, and new identity-theft technology to protect taxpayers is on hold.'b'Undermining the I.R.S. was part of the overall budget deal worked out by House Republicans, Senate Democrats and the White House.

After the cinema shooting in nearby Aurora, Kloepfer decided that for a science fair project he would engineer a \xe2\x80\x9csmart gun\xe2\x80\x9d that could be fired only by an authorized user.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI started with iris recognition, and that seemed a good idea until you realize that many people firing guns wear sunglasses,\xe2\x80\x9d Kloepfer recalls. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I moved on to fingerprints.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kloepfer designed a smart handgun that fires only when a finger it recognizes is on the grip. More than 1,000 fingerprints can be authorized per gun, and Kloepfer says the sensor is 99.999 percent accurate.'b'A child can\xe2\x80\x99t fire the gun. Neither can a thief \xe2\x80\x94 important here in a country in which more than 150,000 guns are stolen annually.'b'Kloepfer\xe2\x80\x99s design 'b'won a grand prize'b' in the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. Then 'b'he won a $50,000 grant'b' from the Smart Tech Challenges Foundation to refine the technology. By the time he enters college in the fall (he applied early to Stanford and has been deferred), he hopes to be ready to license the technology to a manufacturer.'b'There are other approaches to smart guns. The best known, the Armatix iP1, made by a German company and available in the United States 'b'through a complicated online procedure'b', can be fired only if the shooter is wearing a companion wristwatch.'b'The National Rifle Association seems set against smart guns, apparently fearing that they might become mandatory. One problem has been an unfortunate 2002 New Jersey law stipulating that three years after smart guns are available anywhere in the United States, only smart guns can be sold in the state. The attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office there 'b'ruled recently'b' that the Armatix smart gun would not trigger the law, but the provision has still led gun enthusiasts to bully dealers to keep smart guns off the market everywhere in the U.S.'b'Opponents of smart guns say that they aren\xe2\x80\x99t fully reliable. Some, including Kloepfer\xe2\x80\x99s, will need batteries to be recharged once a year or so. Still, if Veronica Rutledge had had one in her purse in that Idaho Walmart, her son wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to shoot and kill her.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSmart guns are going to save lives,\xe2\x80\x9d says Stephen Teret, a gun expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re not going to save all lives, but why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we want to make guns as safe a consumer product as possible?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'David Hemenway, a public health expert at Harvard, says that the way forward is for police departments or the military to buy smart guns, creating a market and proving they work.'b'An interfaith group of religious leaders 'b'is also appealing to gun industry leaders'b', ahead of the huge annual trade show in Las Vegas with 65,000 attendees, to drop opposition to smart guns.'b'Smart guns aren\xe2\x80\x99t a panacea. But when even a 17-year-old kid can come up with a safer gun, why should the gun lobby be so hostile to the option of purchasing one?'b'Something is amiss when we protect our children from toys that they might swallow, but not from firearms. So Veronica Rutledge is dead, and her son will grow up with the knowledge that he killed her \xe2\x80\x94 and we all bear some responsibility when we don\xe2\x80\x99t even try to reduce the carnage.'b'Standing before the press last Tuesday on Capitol Hill, Senator Kelly Ayotte, Republican of New Hampshire, argued that this is no time to be releasing detainees from the military prison in Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba. Opportunistically, she cited the 'b'recent massacre in Paris'b' and deteriorating security in Yemen, which she oddly described as \xe2\x80\x9cthe wild, wild West for terrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d She warned that American officials suspect or know that roughly 30 percent of the men released from Guant\xc3\xa1namo have returned to the fight.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe need a timeout,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Ayotte said, flanked by Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, fellow Republicans who are 'b'co-sponsors of a bill'b' that would prevent the Obama administration from releasing Guant\xc3\xa1namo prisoners who have never been charged and who have been cleared for release by officials based on a thorough risk analysis.'b'Coming from Ms. Ayotte, a defense hawk who takes extreme positions on national security matters, this misguided proposal is unsurprising. But its rollout was particularly troubling for a few reasons. The recidivism rate the senators cited failed to take into account how much it has decreased in recent years. Perhaps most disappointing, though, was Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of the bill, which represented a striking turnaround for a former prisoner of war who has championed closing the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo.'b'In November 2013, Mr. McCain, backing a failed initiative that would have authorized transferring some Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees to the United States, 'b'read out loud on the Senate floor'b' a letter from 38 retired generals and flag officers who supported shutting the facility.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGuant\xc3\xa1namo is a betrayal of American values,\xe2\x80\x9d the former military officers wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cThe prison is a symbol of torture and justice delayed. More than a decade after it opened, Guant\xc3\xa1namo remains a recruiting poster for terrorists, which makes us all less safe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those words are as true now as they were then. President Obama pledged to move swiftly to shut down the prison during his first presidential campaign. Winnowing down the detainee population from a high of 680 in 2003 to 122, with the 'b'recent transfer'b' of five Yemeni men last week to Oman and Estonia, has been extremely difficult because of opposition in Congress and an inability to repatriate certain prisoners to their home countries.'b'Still, the Obama administration has 'b'made significant headway'b', and the recidivism rate of former detainees has dropped considerably. Out of the 88 prisoners who have been released since January 2009, six are known to have become involved with terrorist or insurgent groups, and one is suspected of having done so, a 6.1 percent recidivism rate. During the Bush years, more than 33 percent of the 532 detainees released were confirmed or suspected to have rejoined the fight, according to 'b'statistics released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence last September'b'. The Obama administration is looking for countries willing to take 54 prisoners who have been cleared for release by a team of American national security agencies and is evaluating how many of the remaining detainees could be safely freed. Only 10 of the prisoners currently at Guant\xc3\xa1namo, which was established in January 2002, have been prosecuted; seven of them are facing charges in 'b'military commissions'b', and three have been convicted and are either serving sentences or awaiting sentencing.'b'It is long past time for American officials to do the right thing: prosecute suspected terrorists in American courtrooms and shut down a wartime prison that has deservedly brought the United States international scorn. Besides moral and strategic considerations, shutting Guant\xc3\xa1namo would make fiscal sense. Currently, the United States spends $3 million a year to hold each detainee.'b'The alternative, as articulated by Mr. Graham, is a travesty. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a war without end,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t release prisoners until the war is over. I would argue the war is in many ways just starting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'EVERY time I read about the actor Mark Wahlberg\xe2\x80\x99s bid to be pardoned by the state of Massachusetts for crimes he committed in his youth, I flash back to the days I spent with him for a Times magazine profile just before \xe2\x80\x9cBoogie Nights\xe2\x80\x9d came out. I remember a specific detail.'b'He was then trying to pivot from being Marky Mark, the trash-talking rapper and underwear model, to being a serious actor. Over lunch one day, I asked him about his bulky eyeglasses, which sent a signal of studiousness that struck me as too emphatic. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t familiar from any old images of him that I\xe2\x80\x99d seen.'b'Was he nearsighted?'b'No, he said.'b'Farsighted?'b'No.'b'So what were they for?'b'He stalled and squirmed a bit. Then he conceded that they were just for effect.'b'In the story I submitted, I fleetingly mentioned the glasses. A fact checker questioned my description of them as \xe2\x80\x9cnonprescription,\xe2\x80\x9d because Wahlberg\xe2\x80\x99s publicist, a savvy one, had insisted to her that it was an error and that we must take it out. But I had Wahlberg on tape. The description 'b'stayed'b'.'b'Ah, Hollywood. It\xe2\x80\x99s a place where reinvention rules supreme; where truth is often whatever script you can convincingly perform and persuasively sell; and where any details or bits of the past that run counter to your purposes are annoyances to be deleted. That applies both to what\xe2\x80\x99s put on-screen \xe2\x80\x94 as \xe2\x80\x9cSelma,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Sniper\xe2\x80\x9d and a few of the other movies nominated for a Best Picture Oscar last week demonstrate \xe2\x80\x94 and to what you\xe2\x80\x99re putting out there about yourself.'b'Elsewhere life is less easily manipulated. Wahlberg is confronting that now.'b'While there\xe2\x80\x99s not yet been any decision about his pardon application, which was filed late last year, it has drawn no small measure of extra attention to him, much of it rightly negative.'b'What I wish it would do is amplify and broaden a conversation in America about the contradictions in the way we treat people who\xe2\x80\x99ve done their time.'b'Generally, we send them back out into the world with the exhortation that they build or rebuild productive lives, which we\xe2\x80\x99re invested in having them do. But we simultaneously saddle them with a dizzying range of restrictions, varying from state to state, that make that significantly more difficult.'b'We deny them kinds of government assistance available to others. We prevent them from engaging in all sorts of business transactions and jobs, and some of these prohibitions make little or no sense.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have people with real talents who aren\xe2\x80\x99t able to employ those talents,\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Osler, a law professor who is an expert on pardons, told me. If our goal is to prevent recidivism, this isn\xe2\x80\x99t a smart way to go about it.'b'Pardons eliminate many restrictions. And for people who\xe2\x80\x99ve served their sentences, they should be more common. But they\xe2\x80\x99re granted in a small enough minority of cases that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to argue that Wahlberg\xe2\x80\x99s should be one.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s 43 now. His crimes occurred at 16, in Dorchester, Mass. On a night when he has said that he was heavily intoxicated, he used a stick to hit a Vietnamese man on the head with such force that it knocked him unconscious. As he fled the police, he punched another Vietnamese man in the eye. All the while, he used racial slurs.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t out of character. When he was 15, according to court documents, he was involved in two incidents of using racial slurs as he physically threatened black children. That matter was referred to civil court and he got off with a warning.'b'For the subsequent crimes, he served 45 days in prison, and he has said in interviews over time that once he got out, he was determined to be a different man.'b'That transformation was gradual and fitful. As Marky Mark in the early 1990s, he was known for using crude language about women. He was implicated in brawls.'b'He dedicated an autobiographical picture book to his penis.'b'SINCE then there have been many fine movies, an Oscar nomination, a wife, four kids. Several prominent Hollywood producers with whom I spoke last week said that his reputation in the industry today is sterling. They praised him as a joy to work with: sincere, diligent, humble.'b'In his pardon application, he said that he tried to get to church almost daily and that he devoted considerable time to working with troubled kids through the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation, which has raised about $9.6 million over the years.'b'But he can afford that in a way that very few ex-cons can. And, oddly, one of many reasons Wahlberg cited for wanting a pardon has to do with money. He and his brothers are expanding their chain of Wahlburgers restaurants, and licensing in some states is complicated by his record of a felony conviction.'b'Advocates for Asian-Americans have complained that before filing his pardon application, Wahlberg never reached out to the Vietnamese community in Dorchester or to the victims of his crimes.'b'Some good could come from his appeal. \xe2\x80\x9cIt shines a light on a beneficent power that has atrophied in Massachusetts,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Margaret Love'b', a lawyer with extensive knowledge about the pardon process, wrote in a recent 'b'blog post'b'. With any luck, she added, it will encourage pardons \xe2\x80\x9cfor the dozens of ordinary individuals whose futures may depend on it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But nothing that Wahlberg has said publicly suggests that he was motivated by that. He declined to be interviewed for this column.'b'And when I spoke with Love, asking her about the proper fate of his particular request for a pardon, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cGiven the irregularity and the absence of pardons, I think it would be a very bad idea to single out someone of such a high profile.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right. In Massachusetts, just four pardons have been granted over the last dozen years. If Wahlberg got one of the next ones, it would be going to a person whose unpardoned offenses don\xe2\x80\x99t shadow him the way most former prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 do. He\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong poster boy for the right cause.'b'Financial generosity shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a factor in his (or anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s) favor: That\xe2\x80\x99s just the criminal-justice system\xe2\x80\x99s version of income inequality.'b'In his application he argued that getting a pardon could be an inspiration to people trying to turn their lives around and hoping for forgiveness. But to the less advantaged of them, it would be the opposite: a confirmation that being white, rich and famous earns you special treatment.'b'What he\xe2\x80\x99s asking for isn\xe2\x80\x99t just an image overhaul, a routine Hollywood rewrite.'b'If he can\xe2\x80\x99t see that, he needs better glasses.'b'Doctors and patients debate an assertion that the yearly exam is \xe2\x80\x9cbasically worthless.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Skip Your Annual Physical'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Ezekiel J.

As Nanna got out of the car, she tripped over her friend Shirley\xe2\x80\x99s cane, fell to the pavement and came down hard on her elbow. Back at home, she headed to the kitchen to get some dessert \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cand my left leg just crumpled.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the hospital, the doctors ordered X-rays, but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see anything wrong. After two weeks of therapy, Nanna was sent home, but she\xe2\x80\x99d made up her mind. After 30 years of living in Florida, 28 of them as a widow, and most of those spent insisting that the only way she\xe2\x80\x99d go back to her native Michigan was \xe2\x80\x9cin a box,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanna asked her older daughter, my Aunt Marlene, to find her a sunny place near Detroit.'b'Last summer, she moved into an independent living facility with access to a range of services and activities. She has her own apartment, with a kitchen, but can eat her meals in a dining hall. After giving her a few days to unpack and settle in, I got her on the phone. How was it going?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d Nanna began. Her apartment was lovely. The food was just fine, and there were all kinds of classes and courses to while away the hours. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you made any friends?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked, in the same chipper tone I used when my younger child returned from her first day at kindergarten.'b'There was a pause. Then: \xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t let me sit at their table!\xe2\x80\x9d Nanna cried.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWait, what?

I had a lunchbox.

High school doesn\xe2\x80\x99t last forever, everyone grows up. But Nanna\xe2\x80\x99s experience suggests otherwise. It says that the cruel, like the poor, are always with us, that mean girls stay mean \xe2\x80\x94 they just start wearing support hose and dentures.'b'A recent Cornell University study by Karl Pillemer proves the point, showing that aggression among residents in nursing homes is widespread and \xe2\x80\x9cextremely high rates of conflict and violence\xe2\x80\x9d are common. According to the study\xe2\x80\x99s news release, one in five residents was involved in at least one \xe2\x80\x9cnegative and aggressive encounter\xe2\x80\x9d with another resident during a four-week period. Sixteen percent were cursed or yelled at; 6 percent were hit, kicked or bitten; 1 percent were victims of \xe2\x80\x9csexual incidents, such as exposing one\xe2\x80\x99s genitals, touching other residents, or attempting to gain sexual favors;\xe2\x80\x9d and 10.5 percent dealt with other residents\xe2\x80\x99 entering their rooms uninvited, or rummaging through their belongings.'b'Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re brawling on the playground or battling over the best seats in chair-cercize, bad behavior is constant, and the rituals for trying to get in with the in-crowd don\xe2\x80\x99t change much. Nanna\xe2\x80\x99s quest for \xe2\x80\x9cthe Cadillac of walkers,\xe2\x80\x9d a $400 number not covered by Medicare, mirrored my search a decade ago for the nearly thousand-dollar Bugaboo that would signal to my urban-mommy cohort that I belonged.'b'What transforms with age are the criteria for judgment: not looks, not wealth, not the once-coveted ability to drive at night. When you get to be Nanna\xe2\x80\x99s age, you\xe2\x80\x99re reduced to a number \xe2\x80\x94 the younger the better. Even in a residence for the elderly, the 80-somethings will still be cold to the 95-year-olds. Now 99, my Nanna is completely cognizant of what\xe2\x80\x99s going on. Her memory, both short- and long-term, is excellent. But once her new neighbors heard her age, they knew they didn\xe2\x80\x99t want her at their table.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy question is, are they rude? Are they nasty? Or is it that she\xe2\x80\x99s not hearing, or is interpreting something that\xe2\x80\x99s not really something? I can\xe2\x80\x99t tell,\xe2\x80\x9d says Aunt Marlene. \xe2\x80\x9cI think there\xe2\x80\x99s definitely cliques. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if there\xe2\x80\x99s a way to alleviate the feeling of being left out. At 99, do you end up with a group? Does that happen? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. At first I thought, it just takes time. Now I wonder \xe2\x80\x94 maybe this is the way it is. Maybe you can\xe2\x80\x99t expect anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bad behavior doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change. Nor does the response from the ones on the sidelines, watching and hoping for the best. Even with lowered expectations, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard. I fret about my first grader getting shut out of the four-square game or my sixth grader sitting alone at lunch. My mom and her sister wonder if their mother is suffering the same kind of isolation, exclusion and loneliness; the pain of having outlived every single one of your contemporaries, of having lots to say and no one to listen.'b'Nanna tries. Every day, she takes a class: Yiddish, current events, even iPad 101. She gets dressed up for dinner, with a pretty scarf, a new sweater. She\xe2\x80\x99s gotten to know her neighbors, table-mates, even the one who forgets her name between one dinner and the next, and she\xe2\x80\x99s joined a mah-jongg game \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ceven though I haven\xe2\x80\x99t played in years.\xe2\x80\x9d The ledge outside her front door is home to a little stuffed bear, dressed in University of Michigan regalia, a hopeful sentry, and maybe a conversation starter.'b'I try, too. Over Thanksgiving, we celebrated Nanna\xe2\x80\x99s 99th birthday, with all 12 of her great-grandchildren on hand to tour the new apartment. Down in the lobby, my 6-year-old, Phoebe, and I met a beautifully dressed, immaculately made-up woman sitting on a bench with a cane, waiting for her niece to take her to Thanksgiving dinner at 5. It was 2. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to see my kitty?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked, and my daughter happily agreed. I learned that, like Nanna, the woman had moved in over the summer, was a Michigan native, and seemed sharp and aware. Feeling like a guy at a bar \xe2\x80\x94 another echo of another acceptance-and-rejection ritual \xe2\x80\x94 I asked for her number.'b'Then Phoebe and I took the elevator back up to Nanna\xe2\x80\x99s apartment, where the refrigerator door is covered with pictures of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, and I announced, \xe2\x80\x9cNanna, I think I made you a friend.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They commanded global attention for a fleeting few days last spring. Across the world, millions prayed for and tweeted about the plight of the more than 200 Nigerian schoolgirls abducted in northeastern Nigeria by the vicious militant group Boko Haram. The first lady, Michelle Obama, joined the cause, 'b'posting a selfie'b' looking downcast and demanding that the militants \xe2\x80\x9c#BringBackOurGirls.\xe2\x80\x9d The United States government hastily put together a task force of experts and dispatched drones to search for the hostages.'b'Soon, though, the world largely moved on.'b'In recent months, the horrors in remote districts of Nigeria, Africa\xe2\x80\x99s most populous country, have multiplied as the insurgent group has taken new hostages, carried out bombings and scorched entire villages in a quest to wrest territory from government control.'b''b'Newly released satellite images'b' taken in early January corroborate chilling accounts of the recent assaults on Baga and Doro Gowon, two small towns that came under attack on Jan. 3. Researchers with Amnesty International, which released the images, said that roughly 3,720 structures, including homes, were destroyed or damaged by fire.'b'On Jan. 10, a girl witnesses described as being about 'b'10 years old detonated explosives'b' hidden under her veil in a market in Maiduguri, a teeming commercial district in an area controlled by Boko Haram, killing an estimated 20 people.'b'While some of the girls taken hostage in April by Boko Haram 'b'escaped'b', the terrorist group, whose name roughly translates to \xe2\x80\x9cWestern education is forbidden,\xe2\x80\x9d has taken hundreds of other female hostages, according to the Human Rights Watch Nigeria researcher Mausi Segun, 'b'who interviewed several of the students who fled.'b''b'The number of towns under Boko Haram control has expanded from 11 last fall to 17, according to Human Rights Watch. In recent weeks, it has become harder to get an accurate measure of the scale and death toll of attacks because the militants have dismantled telecommunications systems in the areas they have seized. Death toll estimates for the recent attacks on villages ranged from a few hundred to thousands.'b'Until relatively recently, the Nigerian government consistently downplayed the strength of the group, which seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate in Nigeria. As it ramped up attacks last year, Boko Haram laid bare 'b'the weakness of the country\xe2\x80\x99s security forces'b', which have failed to mount an adequate response.'b'Last spring, the United States 'b'dispatched some 80 Air Force personnel'b' to neighboring Chad to fly drones in an effort to help the missing girls. It also sent a Pentagon-led team of some 30 specialists tasked with advising the Nigerian government on intelligence and operational matters. The drone team is long gone. A Pentagon spokesman said last week that surveillance drone flights over Nigeria have become \xe2\x80\x9cinfrequent.\xe2\x80\x9d Only three Pentagon officials remain on the task force.'b'Washington and others in the international community could do more to alleviate the suffering of Nigerians in areas controlled by Boko Haram by providing humanitarian aid and building up the capacity of the Nigerian security forces. But fighting this insurgency will require a Nigerian government willing and able to take on the security challenge effectively. This will require institutional reforms to bolster governance in remote parts of the country and curb heavy-handed practices by the security forces that have alienated many civilians.'b'The 'b'presidential and legislative elections'b' are scheduled to take place next month, but some Nigerians have suggested that the balloting be put off until the violence ebbs. Delaying the elections would be a mistake, however. Newly elected Nigerian leaders might have a chance to chart out a plan to reassert government control in areas lost to the militants.'b'THE idea of yet a third Mitt Romney campaign for the presidency, once the idle dream of a few Romney bundlers and now apparently something embraced by the Man From Bain Capital himself, has been greeted by most Republicans with a mixture of horror, exhaustion and embarrassment. The polite ones sound like a girl before the senior prom who can\xe2\x80\x99t believe that the stumblebum date who ruined her last school dance is in line first to ask her again: 'b'No, please, not this time'b'. The rest sound like the characters in the third act of a horror movie, confronting a shambling revenant that just keeps coming: 'b'How do we kill this thing?'b''b'And these attitudes are understandable. Romney was not, perhaps, quite as terrible a presidential candidate as memories of his worst moments might lead one to believe: He ran ahead of many Republican Senate candidates; he had the most successful presidential debate performance in recent memory; he persuaded the public that he was 'b'closer to the ideological middle'b' than President Obama.'b'But his failures were ... conspicuous. There was the threadbare policy agenda, linked to a self-defeating theory that the election would be decided by the unemployment rate alone. There were the various rich-guy disasters that played into the White House\xe2\x80\x99s effort to portray him as the candidate of the richest 0.47 percent. And most unforgivable, given his promise of a ruthless private sector competence, there were the polling failures and ground game debacles that let Obama coast to victory.'b'What would Romney re-redux offer? Nothing obvious: Romney\xe2\x80\x99s a decade removed from elected office, with nothing on his r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 since except the permanent campaign. As a white, superrich, late-60-something male, he\xe2\x80\x99s the walking embodiment of his party\xe2\x80\x99s image problems. He won the last nominating contest because on the debate stage he looked like Aragorn son of Arathorn among a collection of dwarves and hobbits (plus Jon Huntsman\xe2\x80\x99s elf lord and Ron Paul\xe2\x80\x99s Gollum). Unless meteors strike several state capitols and the United States Senate, that won\xe2\x80\x99t be true this time.'b'So a third Romney run will almost certainly be a blind alley for a man who should be thinking of a better way to serve his country and his fellow man.'b'But should Republicans actively fear a Romney run? I think not: If the conventional wisdom is correct about its folly, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see what harm it can do, save to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s own ego and self-image, to have that folly ruthlessly exposed.'b'Another run 'b'would'b' be genuinely frightening for Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 and this is probably why the reaction against it has been so intense \xe2\x80\x94 if there were any chance of Romney doing what he did in 2012: monopolizing fund-raising to a point where other potentially electable candidates stay out; carpet-bombing his opponents with attack ads; and essentially forcing the party faithful to accept him, flaws and all.'b'But unless G.O.P. power brokers are truly crazy \xe2\x80\x94 and based on 'b'the response to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s trial balloon'b' they aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x94 that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen. Not even close. Instead, a Romney candidacy would depend on a small circle of backers while ceding immense fund-raising territory to Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio ... the list goes on. He wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite resemble his old rivals Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, each of whose insurgent campaigns were floated by a single megadonor, but he would be closer to their position than to that of the commanding Mitt of old.'b'And he would resemble Gingrich and Santorum in other ways. In 2008, he had the backing of key voices in the conservative movement; in 2012, he had the establishment (however reluctantly) behind him. In 2016, he would be on his own, hanging out in Iowa living rooms and New Hampshire diners, trying to win primaries on the basis of debate performances and flesh-pressing and even (gasp!) ideas, like any other long-shot candidate.'b'Which is why, purely as human drama, Romney 3.0 could actually be interesting to watch. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll campaign more openly as a Mormon, running ads like the moving testimonials that aired just before Clint Eastwood\xe2\x80\x99s prime time weird-out at the Republican convention, in which his faith and works are played up rather than hidden. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll roll out a sweeping policy agenda on poverty, as he claims he wants to do, amid incredibly awkward but maybe touching photo ops with the rural unemployed and inner-city kids. Maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll sock Mike Huckabee in the jaw during a debate.'b'Or maybe he\xe2\x80\x99ll be wooden, clueless and entitled; finish sixth in Iowa and fourth in New Hampshire; and drop out. In which case he\xe2\x80\x99ll lose some dignity, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t lose anything at all.'b'So Mitt, it\xe2\x80\x99s your call. I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it, you won\xe2\x80\x99t win it, but I respect a Romney\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose.'b'OUR galaxy, the Milky Way, is home to almost 300 billion stars, and over the last decade, astronomers have made a startling discovery \xe2\x80\x94 almost all those stars have planets. The fact that nearly every pinprick of light you see in the night sky hosts a family of worlds raises a powerful but simple question: \xe2\x80\x9cWhere is everybody?\xe2\x80\x9d Hundreds of billions of planets translate into a lot of chances for evolving intelligent, technologically sophisticated species. So why don\xe2\x80\x99t we see evidence for E.T.s everywhere?'b'The physicist Enrico Fermi first formulated this question, now called the 'b'Fermi paradox'b', in 1950. But in the intervening decades, humanity has recognized that our own climb up the ladder of technological sophistication comes with a heavy price. From climate change to resource depletion, our evolution into a globe-spanning industrial culture is forcing us through the narrow bottleneck of a sustainability crisis. In the wake of this realization, new and sobering answers to Fermi\xe2\x80\x99s question now seem possible.'b'Maybe we\xe2\x80\x99re not the only ones to hit a sustainability bottleneck. Maybe not everyone \xe2\x80\x94 maybe no one \xe2\x80\x94 makes it to the other side.'b'Since Fermi\xe2\x80\x99s day, scientists have gained a new perspective on life in its planetary context. From the vantage point of this relatively new field, astrobiology, our current sustainability crisis may be neither politically contingent nor unique, but a natural consequence of laws governing how planets and life of any kind, anywhere, must interact.'b'The defining feature of a technological civilization is the capacity to intensively \xe2\x80\x9charvest\xe2\x80\x9d energy. But the basic physics of energy, heat and work known as thermodynamics tell us that waste, or what we physicists call entropy, must be generated and dumped back into the environment in the process. Human civilization currently harvests around 100 billion megawatt hours of energy each year and dumps 36 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the planetary system, which is why the atmosphere is holding more heat and the oceans are acidifying. As hard as it is for some to believe, we humans are now steering the planet, however poorly.'b'Can we generalize this kind of planetary hijacking to other worlds? The long history of Earth provides a clue. The oxygen you are breathing right now was not part of our original atmosphere. It was the so-called Great Oxidation Event, two billion years after the formation of the planet, that drove Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmospheric content of oxygen up by a factor of 10,000. What cosmic force could so drastically change an entire planet\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere? Nothing more than the respiratory excretions of anaerobic bacteria then dominating our world. The one gas we most need to survive originated as deadly pollution to our planet\xe2\x80\x99s then-leading species: a simple bacterium.'b'The Great Oxidation Event alone shows that when life (intelligent or otherwise) becomes highly successful, it can dramatically change its host planet. And what is true here is likely to be true on other planets as well.'b'But can we predict how an alien industrial civilization might alter its world? From a half-century of exploring our own solar system we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned a lot about planets and how they work. We know that Mars was once a habitable world with water rushing across its surface. And Venus, a planet that might have been much like Earth, was instead transformed by a runaway greenhouse effect into a hellish world of 800-degree days.'b'By studying these nearby planets, we\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered general rules for both climate and climate change. These rules, based in physics and chemistry, must apply to any species, anywhere, taking up energy-harvesting and civilization-building in a big way. For example, any species climbing up the technological ladder by harvesting energy through combustion must alter the chemical makeup of its atmosphere to some degree. Combustion always produces chemical byproducts, and those byproducts can\xe2\x80\x99t just disappear. As astronomers at Penn State recently discovered, if planetary conditions are right (like the size of a planet\xe2\x80\x99s orbit), even relatively small changes in atmospheric chemistry can have significant climate effects. That means that for some civilization-building species, the sustainability crises can hit earlier rather than later.'b'Even if an intelligent species didn\xe2\x80\x99t rely on combustion early in its development, sustainability issues could still arise. All forms of intensive energy-harvesting will have feedbacks, even if some are more powerful than others. A 'b'study by scientists'b' at the Max Planck Institute in Jena, Germany, found that extracting energy from wind power on a huge scale can cause its own global climate consequences. When it comes to building world-girdling civilizations, there are no planetary free lunches.'b'This realization motivated me, along with Woodruff Sullivan of the University of Washington, to look at sustainability in its astrobiological context. As we describe in a recent paper, using what\xe2\x80\x99s already known about planets and life, it is now possible to create a broad program for modeling co-evolving \xe2\x80\x9ctrajectories\xe2\x80\x9d for technological species and their planets. Depending on initial conditions and choices made by the species (such as the mode of energy harvesting), some trajectories will lead to an unrecoverable sustainability crisis and eventual population collapse. Others, however, may lead to long-lived, sustainable civilizations.'b'Such research is, however, more than prospecting for scientific curiosities.'b'One answer to the Fermi paradox is that nobody makes it through \xe2\x80\x94 that climate change is fate, that nothing we do today matters because civilization inevitably leads to catastrophic planetary changes. But our models may show that isn\xe2\x80\x99t the case.'b'By studying sustainability as a generic astrobiological problem, we can understand if the challenge we face will be like threading a needle or crossing a wide valley. Answering this question demands a far deeper understanding of how planets respond to the kind of stresses energy-intensive species (like ours) place on them. It\xe2\x80\x99s an approach no different from that of doctors using different kinds of animals, and their molecular biology, to discover cures for human disease.'b'With this perspective, we also gain an essential truth. We are one form of life, on one planet, in a universe of countless planets. Through hard-won scientific gains, we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun discovering the patterns and laws governing planets together with the life they host. Ten thousand years from now the Democrats and the Republicans and their squabbles over climate change will be long gone. But the laws of planets and life we\xe2\x80\x99re now revealing won\xe2\x80\x99t have changed. Not on this world or any other.'b'HAVANA \xe2\x80\x94 A VARIATION of the scene has played out in sporadic nightmares I began having as a child. A band of guerrilla fighters with scraggly beards, dirty camouflage uniforms and rifles slung over their shoulders walk toward me. Their glares are callous, their words gruff. I watch as black rubber boots caked with mud advance toward me. It is too late. I am cornered, trapped.'b'Growing up in Colombia, I imagined being kidnapped as the only way to end up face-to-face with militants from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a Marxist-inspired guerrilla group that has battled the government for over half a century. Yet, on a recent afternoon, I found myself with two members of the FARC, unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes, as they nursed drinks at a hotel bar in Havana, sitting on pastel green chairs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you guys by chance Colombian?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked meekly, verifying that these were the men who had agreed to meet me after several awkward phone calls earlier in the week. When they nodded, I sat at their table for the first of a series of fascinating conversations with countrymen I grew up fearing and loathing.'b'Years ago, had we met on a country road, these men would likely have seen me as fair game to hold for ransom, an embodiment of the class of privileged Colombians they call oligarchs. Years ago, I might have felt relief, even a bit of delight, to see news footage of their bodies left on the battlefield. But this is a new era for Colombians. So I shook hands and ordered a round of beers.'b'A little over two years ago, the first team from the FARC traveled from jungle hideouts to Havana for peace talks with the government of President Juan Manuel Santos. The negotiations here, by far the most expansive effort to de-escalate one of the longest-running armed conflicts in modern history, have forced all Colombians to take stock of a painful past. There is reason to be hopeful: Late last year, the FARC declared a unilateral, indefinite cease-fire that seems to be largely holding, and just days ago, the Colombian government stated its willingness to work toward a bilateral suspension of hostilities as soon as possible.'b'The FARC, which is estimated to have 7,000 members, is by far the largest insurgency group in Colombia\xe2\x80\x99s conflict, which over the decades has been fueled by entrenched inequality and a multibillion-dollar narcotics trade. Getting it to disband would not bring about peace overnight, but it would go a long way toward ending a cycle of bloodshed that has left an estimated seven million victims, including people who have been slain, abducted and displaced amid the fighting. Over the past four decades, more than 39,000 Colombians have been kidnapped, according to government estimates.'b'If a peace deal is signed, Mr. Santos has vowed to put it before voters as a referendum before it becomes binding. But just how much Colombians are willing to forget, forgive and put behind them is a vexing question.'b'My first meeting with the FARC members lasted about half an hour and for the most part, we stuck to pleasantries. I asked to interview Luciano Mar\xc3\xadn Arango, better known by his alias, Iv\xc3\xa1n M\xc3\xa1rquez, the second-in-command and lead negotiator in Havana. They offered to get him to answer a few questions in writing, before eventually committing to a meeting.'b'A couple of days later, they summoned me again to the hotel, and in the lobby, I was asked to surrender my cellphone before being guided into a small conference room.'b'Inside, were two FARC leaders whose faces I recognized from the news and fugitive bulletins. Jorge Torres, 61, known by the alias Pablo Catatumbo, and Felix Antonio Mu\xc3\xb1oz, 55, who uses the nom de guerre Pastor Alape, were sitting on soft couches. With them were two young women, who were part of their delegation. Both men are among the FARC leaders under indictment in the United States for allegedly smuggling more than $25 billion worth of cocaine. Washington has offered up to $2.5 million for information leading to the arrest of each.'b'The FARC members were cordial, but reserved, as Cuban waiters served us beer. I asked what they had heard from their victims, many of whom have been invited to Havana to offer their accounts. Mr. Mu\xc3\xb1oz said that the prevailing sentiment during the peace negotiations in Havana is not recrimination over the past. \xe2\x80\x9cDespite the pain, the victims have not conveyed hate, but rather an immense desire for peace,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. Mu\xc3\xb1oz, however, was quick to point out that the people who have traveled to Havana to offer testimony as the two sides map out an accord include victims of government forces and right-wing paramilitaries, which committed some of the most heinous abuses in the conflict. Many FARC members, he told me, have suffered enormously, too.'b'The women, who spoke little at first, appeared to watch me warily. I asked one, who goes by the alias Camila Cienfuegos, who wore butterfly earrings and had piercing black eyes, how she wound up in the group. As a child, she told me, she dreamed of being a journalist. But in her late teens, she saw no good avenues to get ahead in life and found in the guerrillas camaraderie and protection.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou see the differences that exist,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Cienfuegos, 34. \xe2\x80\x9cSome people can go to school, and some people can\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d Samy Flores, 27, said Colombians who are raised in districts wrecked by violence are often forced to pick a side. She did so as a teenager.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll that surrounds you is war and suffering,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you remain as a civilian, you\xe2\x80\x99re exposed. And you feel a responsibility for the freedom of Colombians.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I grew up in a house with two maids and attended a private American school where many of my classmates were dropped off in bulletproof cars packed with bodyguards. For years, many wealthy Colombians had the ability to keep the war at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, a troubling reality but not an imminent threat. As a child, after watching the news, I would sometimes ask my father, as he tucked me into bed, how close the nearest battleground was. Four, six hours, he would say, comfortingly.'b'But in fact it was a lot closer. One ordinary evening when I was around 9, we were robbed at gunpoint in our house. As heavily armed thieves packed my mother\xe2\x80\x99s jewelry and our electronic appliances into bags, one spotted a framed photo of me, smiling as a 3-year-old, at Walt Disney World. \xe2\x80\x9cI also would have wanted my kids to meet Mickey Mouse,\xe2\x80\x9d the robber said derisively. The men forced my dad to open a safe at gunpoint, warning that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t, they would abduct my 2-year-old sister. We had no reasonable expectation that the men would be caught or punished. But we had the comfort of knowing we had money to replace the appliances, build a wall around the house and hire an armed guard.'b'During the 1990s, a war once largely confined to the countryside increasingly crept into the cities. Targeted assassinations of judges and prosecutors became routine. Bombings occurred with chilling frequency. Kidnappings, most carried out by the FARC, were so rampant that many Colombians took out ransom insurance.'b'Several classmates abruptly moved abroad. Weeks after high school graduation, the parents of a close friend from school, Adriana Escobar, were snatched by the FARC at their country house some 30 miles from Bogot\xc3\xa1.'b'Jorge Cavelier, my friend\xe2\x80\x99s stepfather, and her mother, Margarita Lega, were locked in a tiny, squalid room with a twin bed. They urinated and defecated in jars and were constantly reminded that a rescue attempt would force their captors to put a bullet through their heads. Mr. Cavelier was freed in December 1999, after more than five months in captivity, once his family paid a ransom that had been brokered for the release of the couple. The FARC reneged on the deal, though, holding Ms. Lega for six more months as it extorted even more money from desperate relatives.'b'When I finally got an audience with Mr. Mar\xc3\xadn, the group\xe2\x80\x99s top man in Havana, he showed no remorse for all the kidnappings, though even the FARC has disavowed that tactic.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRetentions,\xe2\x80\x9d he corrected me, \xe2\x80\x9cwere done to support rebellion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also brushed aside questions about the group\xe2\x80\x99s role in drug trafficking, which has been well documented, and said he hoped the United States would roll back the criminal cases that would hang over FARC leaders after a peace agreement is signed. He is the subject of a bounty of up to $5 million offered by the United States.'b'While he is chillingly unapologetic about kidnapping, Mr. Mar\xc3\xadn said he had found the testimony of the victims of both sides haunting, an experience that forced the negotiators and international observers in the room to reflect on a brutal history. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve borne witness to the pain that weighs on many Colombians as a result of this confrontation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'At the negotiation table in Havana, the two sides have reached tentative agreements about agrarian reforms, a long-term approach to curb the drug trade and a political framework that would allow the guerrilla group to compete at the ballot box. The ongoing session has focused on victims\xe2\x80\x99 rights.'b'The final and most complex task, which negotiators hope to conclude this year, involves agreeing on who will be punished, and how severely, for abuses committed in wartime, and how to absorb rank-and-file guerrilla members into civilian society. Mr. Mar\xc3\xadn argues that guerrilla leaders shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t face prison sentences. \xe2\x80\x9cNo peace process has led to that outcome,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not going to ask for forgiveness for having taken up arms.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'RECENTLY, I asked Mr. Cavelier, my friend\xe2\x80\x99s stepfather, who now lives in Miami, what he would like to see happen. His career as an artist was derailed for years after the kidnapping. His wife, to this day, feels afraid every time she visits Colombia. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everyone must be held responsible for their acts,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cavelier said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how they could argue that there weren\xe2\x80\x99t victims, that this was all about their political ambitions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was no discernible anger in his voice, but he was not optimistic. \xe2\x80\x9cThese people have a different type of conscience,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the FARC. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re unable to speak a single truthful word.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Colombian government officials are struggling to draw up a transitional justice framework that strikes the right balance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBlanket amnesty is out of the question,\xe2\x80\x9d the government\xe2\x80\x99s top negotiator, Sergio Jaramillo, said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has to be accountability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Mar\xc3\xadn said Colombians who have played leading roles in the conflict, including statesmen, ministers, generals and businesspeople, must come together at the end of the peace talks for an \xe2\x80\x9cact of collective pardon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to pledge to a \xe2\x80\x98never again,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'That night, after our meeting, I lay awake thinking about how vulnerable and anxious I felt during much of my childhood. I yearned for the country I left behind as a teenager and thought about the dimming extent to which it still felt like home. I don\xe2\x80\x99t trust Mr. Mar\xc3\xadn. But our best hope might require having faith in his words.'b'The lead article in the first edition of Charlie Hebdo after the massacre at its Paris offices by Islamists claiming to avenge cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad \xe2\x80\x94 the edition distributed as an astonishing five million copies \xe2\x80\x94 raised a thorny, sensitive question. After thanking all those who had shown solidarity with the magazine, its editor in chief, G\xc3\xa9rard Biard, asked a question that, he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctorments us\xe2\x80\x9d:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre we finally going to rid our political and intellectual vocabulary of the dirty term \xe2\x80\x98la\xc3\xafcard int\xc3\xa9griste\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Loosely translated, those words mean \xe2\x80\x9cdie-hard secularist.\xe2\x80\x9d What Mr. Biard was challenging was the argument that committed secularists like himself and the staff of Charlie Hebdo had essentially brought this tragedy upon themselves, and that there is, by implication, a sort of moral equivalence between deeply held secularist views and the \xe2\x80\x9creligious totalitarianism\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 his words \xe2\x80\x94 that he and his staff loved to skewer.'b'Over the years, he went on, Charlie Hebdo and other champions of la la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x94 the secularism enshrined in French politics \xe2\x80\x94 had been assailed as \xe2\x80\x9cIslamophobes, Christianophobes, provocateurs, irresponsible, throwers of oil on the fire, racists\xe2\x80\x9d and the like.'b'Even as people lamented the massacre, he wrote, some of them offered a maddening qualifier: \xe2\x80\x9cYes, we condemn terrorism, but.......\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes, burning down a newspaper is bad, but..... We have heard it all, and our friends as well....\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Obviously there can be no \xe2\x80\x9cbut\xe2\x80\x9d in condemning the murderous attack on Charlie Hebdo, or the ideology that encourages murder in the name of religion.'b'Irreverent magazines like Charlie Hebdo have been a fixture in Western societies for many years, and France has a strong tradition of such journalism.'b'The Internet, moreover, has opened the door to almost every level and form of expression.'b'Yet there are legitimate questions raised about freedom of expression in this tragedy.'b'In the wake of the terror attack, French authorities began aggressive enforcements of a law against supporting or justifying terrorism, including arrests of people who spoke admiringly about the shootings at Charlie Hebdo. Not surprisingly, their actions have raised questions of a double standard \xe2\x80\x94 one for cartoonists who deliberately insult religion, when their cartoons are certain to antagonize Muslims at a time when anti-Muslim feelings are already at high levels in France and across much of Europe, and another for those who react by applauding terrorists.'b'The difference, according to French authorities, is between the right to attack an idea and the right to attack people or incite hatred.'b'The distinction is recognized in the various laws against hate speech or inciting violence that exist in most Western states.'b'As a consequence of World War II, France and several other European countries have laws against denying the Holocaust, and with a rise in anti-Semitism in France, authorities have actively sought to curb hate speech, like the anti-Semitic routines of a comedian, Dieudonn\xc3\xa9 M\xe2\x80\x99bala M\xe2\x80\x99bala.'b'Freedom of expression is broader in the United States, but there, too, there are legal limitations on speech that involves incitement, libel, obscenity or child pornography.'b'But drawing the line between speech that is disgusting and speech that is dangerous is inherently difficult and risky.'b'In Israel, mocking Muhammad can bring a prison term, as it did for Tatiana Susskind, a Russian immigrant who posted drawings of the Prophet as a pig in Hebron in 1997.'b'She was accused, among other things, of committing a racist act and harming religious sensitivities, and sentenced to two years in prison. Laws like those in France against \xe2\x80\x9cwords or acts of hatred\xe2\x80\x9d are based on what is often a subjective judgment. And any constraints on freedom of expression invite government abuse.'b'Tastes, standards and situations change, and in the end it is best for editors and societies at large to judge what is fit \xe2\x80\x94 or safe \xe2\x80\x94 to print.'b'That the tragedy in Paris has served to raise these questions is in no way an insult to the members of the Charlie Hebdo staff who perished.'b'Shocking people into confronting reality was, after all, what their journal \xe2\x80\x94 which they proudly called a \xe2\x80\x9cjournal irresponsable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was all about.'b'The Olympic spirit has come to this: Two authoritarian countries are vying to host the 2022 Winter Games, competing to endure a huge financial strain for the benefit of burnishing their public image. The withdrawal of Oslo in October left Beijing, China\xe2\x80\x99s capital, and Almaty, the largest city in Kazakhstan, as the contenders. They formally submitted their bids to the 'b'International Olympic Committee'b' this month.'b'That helps explain why the president of the International Olympic Committee, the German lawyer Thomas Bach, pushed through landmark human rights reforms at a big Olympic summit meeting in Monaco last month.'b'For the first time, host countries must sign a contract that requires protections for human rights, labor and the environment. These \xe2\x80\x9cinternational agreements and protocols\xe2\x80\x9d are meant to protect against abuses such as Russia\xe2\x80\x99s anti-gay law, passed ahead of last year\xe2\x80\x99s Winter Games in Sochi, and the labor and human rights abuses before and during the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing. These reforms are about to get a rigorous test in the global spotlight \xe2\x80\x94 whether the 2022 Games are in China, which welcomed journalists to Beijing in 2008 with a censored Internet, or Kazakhstan, which locks up critics and closes down newspapers.'b'Over the past decade, Human Rights Watch has documented how major sporting events are also accompanied by human rights violations when games are awarded to serial human rights abusers. Repressive countries promised to respect media and other rights to secure the events, then reneged and relied on international sporting bodies to stay silent.'b'As these countries prepare for events, forced evictions without fair compensation free up space for the massive new infrastructure construction that Olympics require. Migrant workers are cheated and labor under long hours and sometimes deadly working conditions. Construction leads to environmental and other complaints. Activists who object are silenced or jailed. Beijing locked up critics of the Olympics. In Russia, an environmentalist drew a three-year prison sentence, and members of the feminist band Pussy Riot were beaten and detained, for their protests of the Sochi Games. Given the abuses, is there any hope for change?'b'If there is the political will to implement them, the contract reforms could improve conditions in countries that host big sporting events. Autocrats are increasingly turning to international sporting events to boost their global standing, so the regulations adopted by their governing bodies might be the only way to make human rights advances in some of the most abusive places.'b'At Sochi last year, for example, the I.O.C. pressured the Russian government to take action against the theft of wages from workers who helped build Olympic venues and infrastructure. Some 500 companies were investigated, and inspectors found that thousands of workers had been cheated out of more than $8 million in wages. The general director of a top construction company was arrested on suspicion of withholding wages. This action resulted from a specific reform from the 2009 Olympic Congress: a promise that the I.O.C. would intervene in the event of \xe2\x80\x9cserious abuses,\xe2\x80\x9d including abuses of migrant workers.'b'In Iran, hard-liners and reformists alike cheer the country\xe2\x80\x99s volleyball successes. A law student, Ghoncheh Ghavami, was jailed in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s notorious Evin prison last year after she protested a ban on women entering a stadium to watch an International Federation of Volleyball World League match. In November, the federation (known as FIVB, the acronym in French) called on the Iranian government to release Ms. Ghavami, and affirmed its commitment to \xe2\x80\x9cinclusivity and the right of women to participate in sport on an equal basis.\xe2\x80\x9d The federation warned that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s policy could limit its ability to host international tournaments in the future. Ms. Ghavami was released on bail shortly thereafter, but not before a revolutionary court convicted her of \xe2\x80\x9cpropaganda against the state\xe2\x80\x9d and sentenced her to one year in prison. She is appealing.'b'In 2012, Saudi Arabia allowed two women, at the last moment, to compete at the London Summer Games. But it still forbids sports for all girls in state schools and has no women\xe2\x80\x99s sports federations. The Saudis should win a gold medal in brazenness for sending a 199-member men-only team to last fall\xe2\x80\x99s Asian Games, claiming, \xe2\x80\x9cTechnically, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to introduce any ladies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Human rights and sports crises are not limited to the Olympics. Russia, despite its record of worker abuse, was awarded the 2018 World Cup. This summer, authoritarian Azerbaijan will roll out the welcome mat for the first European Games in Baku, despite escalating repression, including the December arrest of a top investigative journalist.'b'As Qatar builds an estimated $200 billion of infrastructure for the 2022 World Cup, hundreds of South Asian migrant workers have died working on construction projects. FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, is ripe for institutional reform. In May, it will hold a once-in-a-generation presidential election, in which the current president, Sepp Blatter of Switzerland, will seek a fifth term against stiff competition, including Prince Ali bin al-Hussein of Jordan, who has championed reforms to advance women\xe2\x80\x99s participation. Those candidates should back human-rights-based reforms to the FIFA Charter and set out their position on the human rights, discrimination, corruption and labor crises that have dogged the body.'b'The Olympic reforms passed in December mean that if future host countries fail in their duty to uphold rights, the I.O.C. is now obliged to enforce the terms of the hosting agreement \xe2\x80\x94 including the ultimate sanction of withdrawing the Olympics. And for those who break rules like nondiscrimination, the punishment should be a ban on playing and hosting, as the I.O.C. imposed on apartheid South Africa from 1964 to 1992 and Taliban-run Afghanistan from 1999 to 2002.'b'Mr. Bach has started the ball rolling, but with abuses mounting around global sporting events, it\xe2\x80\x99s time for other sporting federations like FIFA to begin reforms. Fans, corporate sponsors and the general public are increasingly turned off by human rights violations. The I.O.C. reforms aren\xe2\x80\x99t a panacea, but they represent an important step forward.'b''b' 'b'Minky Worden, 'b' director of global initiatives at Human Rights Watch, is the editor of \xe2\x80\x9cChina\xe2\x80\x99s Great Leap: The Beijing Games and Olympian Human Rights.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'Live free or die: This is the maxim of our age. But the freedoms we celebrate are particular and limited. We fetishize the freedom of business from state control; the freedom not to pay taxes; the freedom to carry guns and speak our minds and worship whom we will. But despite, in some cases because of, this respect for particular freedoms, every day the scope of our lives appears to contract.'b'Half a century ago, we were promised that rising wealth would mean less work, longer vacations and more choice. But our working hours rise in line with economic growth, and they are now governed by a corporate culture of snooping and quantification, of infantilizing dictats and impossible demands, all of which smothers autonomy and creativity. Technologies that promised to save time and free us from drudgery (such as email and smartphones) fill our heads with a clatter so persistent it stifles the ability to think.'b'Public spaces in our cities are reduced to pasteurized piazzas, in which loitering without intent to shop is treated as suspicious. Protest is muted by dozens of constraining laws. Young people, who have no place in this dead-eyed, sanitized landscape, scarcely venture from their bedrooms. Political freedom now means choosing between alternative versions of market fundamentalism.'b'Even the freedoms we do possess we tend not to exercise. We spend hours every day watching other people doing what we might otherwise be doing: dancing, singing, playing sports, even cooking. We venture outdoors to seek marginally different varieties of stuff we already possess. \xe2\x80\x9cGetting and spending, we lay waste our powers/Little we see in Nature that is ours,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote William Wordsworth, and it is truer today than it was then.'b'We entertain the illusion that we have chosen our lives. Why, if this is the case, do our apparent choices differ so little from those of other people? Why do we live and work and travel and eat and dress and entertain ourselves in almost identical fashion? It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder, when we possess and use it so little, that we make a fetish out of freedom.'b'Perhaps we have forgotten the bitter complaint made by Benjamin Franklin in 1753: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen an Indian Child has been brought up among us, taught our language and habituated to our Customs, yet if he goes to see his relations and make one Indian Ramble with them, there is no perswading him ever to return.\xe2\x80\x9d But when European Americans \xe2\x80\x9chave been taken prisoners young by the Indians, and lived a while among them, tho\xe2\x80\x99 ransomed by their Friends, and treated with all imaginable tenderness to prevail with them to stay among the English, yet in a Short time they become disgusted with our manner of life ... and take the first good Opportunity of escaping again into the Woods, from whence there is no reclaiming them.\xe2\x80\x9d In 1785 Hector de Cr\xc3\xa8vecoeur asked two European refuseniks why they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t come home. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reasons they gave me would greatly surprise you: the most perfect freedom, the ease of living, the absence of those cares and corroding solicitudes which so often prevail with us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We arose in a thrilling, terrible world. The African savannas on which the first hominids evolved were dominated by saber-toothed and false saber-toothed cats, giant hyenas and bear dogs. When human beings arrived in the Americas, 14,000 years ago, they found ground sloths the weight of elephants; a beaver eight feet from nose to tail; armadillos like small cars; giant lions and sabertooths; short-faced bears whose shocking armory of teeth and claws suggests they drove giant lions and saber-tooths off their prey. A bird in Argentina had a wingspan of 26 feet. Fanged salmon nine feet long migrated inland from the Pacific coast.'b'We carry with us the psychological equipment, rich in instinct and emotion, required to navigate that world. But our survival in the modern economy requires the use of few of the mental and physical capacities we possess. Sometimes it feels like a small and shuffling life. Our humdrum, humiliating lives leave us, I believe, ecologically bored.'b'At times this sensation has overwhelmed me. It happened in a newly discovered bone cave in southern England. The walls and floor were encrusted with calcite crystals that glittered in the torchlight. One of the archaeologists with whom I was exploring it handed me the atlas vertebra of a Bronze Age cow. Then he picked up another bone, this time with both hands: another atlas vertebra, but monstrous. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same species as the first one. But this is the wild version. The aurochs.\xe2\x80\x9d As I turned it over in my hands, feeling its great weight, I experienced what seemed like an electric jolt of recognition. It felt raw, feral, pungent, thrilling. The color seemed to drain from modern life.'b'I felt it again when stalking up a tidal channel with a trident, trying to spear flounders. After two hours scanning the sand intently for signs of the fish, I was suddenly transported by the fierce conviction that I had done it a thousand times before. I felt it most keenly when I stumbled across the fresh corpse of a deer in a wood. I hoisted it onto my shoulders. As soon as I felt its warmth on my back, my skin flushed, my hair stood on end and I wanted to roar. Civilization slid off like a bathrobe. I believe that in these cases I accidentally unlocked a lumber room in the mind, in which vestigial faculties shaped by our evolutionary past are stored. These experiences ignited in me a smoldering longing for a richer and rawer life than the one I lead.'b'Unless we are prepared to reject civilization altogether and live in the woods, there is no complete answer to this predicament. But I think there is a partial one. Across many rich nations, especially the United States, global competition is causing the abandonment of farming on less fertile land. Rather than trying to tame and hold back the encroaching wilds, I believe we should help to accelerate the process of reclamation, removing redundant roads and fences, helping to re-establish missing species, such as wolves and cougars and bears, building bridges between recovering habitats to create continental-scale wildlife corridors, such as those promoted by the Rewilding Institute.'b'This rewilding of the land permits, if we choose, a partial rewilding of our own lives. It allows us to step into a world that is not controlled and regulated, to imagine ourselves back into the rawer life from which we came, to discover, perhaps, the ecstasy I experienced when I picked up that deer. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have to give up our washing machines and computers and eyeglasses and longevity to shed our ecological boredom and recover some measure of the freedom that has been denied to us. Perhaps we do need to remember who we are.'b''b'\n'b'George Monbiot 'b' is an ecologist, journalist, and the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cFeral: Rewilding the Land, the Sea, and Human Life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cTo misname things is to add to the world\xe2\x80\x99s unhappiness.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether or not Albert Camus really did utter these words, they are an astonishingly apt description of the situation in which the French government now finds itself. Indeed, the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius no longer even dares pronounce the real name of things.'b'Mr. Fabius will not describe as \xe2\x80\x9cIslamists\xe2\x80\x9d the terrorists who on Wednesday, Jan. 7, walked into the offices of the newspaper Charlie Hebdo, right in the heart of Paris. Nor will he use \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic State\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the radical Sunni group that now controls territory in Syria and Iraq. No reference can be made to \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic fundamentalism,\xe2\x80\x9d for fear that Islam and Islamism might get conflated. The terms \xe2\x80\x9cDaesh\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDaesh cutthroats\xe2\x80\x9d are to be favored instead, even though in Arabic \xe2\x80\x9cDaesh\xe2\x80\x9d means the very thing to be hidden: \xe2\x80\x9cIslamic State.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Let us call things by their rightful names, since the French government seems reluctant to do so. 'b'France'b', land of human rights and freedoms, was attacked on its own soil by a totalitarian ideology: Islamic fundamentalism. It is only by refusing to be in denial, by looking the enemy in the eye, that one can avoid conflating issues. Muslims themselves need to hear this message. They need the distinction between Islamist terrorism and their faith to be made clearly.'b'Yet this distinction can only be made if one is willing to identify the threat. It does our Muslim compatriots no favors to fuel suspicions and leave things unspoken. Islamist terrorism is a cancer on Islam, and Muslims themselves must fight it at our side.'b'Once things are called what they are, the real work begins. Nothing has been done yet. Whether from the right or the left, one French administration after another has failed to size up the problem or the task to be accomplished. Everything must be reviewed, from the intelligence services to the police force, from the prison system to the surveillance of jihadist networks. Not that the French security services have let us down: They proved their courage and determination again during the Jan. 9 hostage crisis in a kosher grocery near the Porte de Vincennes in Paris. However their actions have been hobbled by a series of mistakes committed by the powers that be.'b'These mistakes must also be called by their names. I will mention only three, but they are of crucial importance.'b'First, the dogma of the free movement of peoples and goods is so firmly entrenched among the leaders of the European Union that the very idea of border checks is deemed to be heretical. And yet, every year tons of weapons from the Balkans enter French territory unhindered and hundreds of jihadists move freely around Europe. Small surprise then that Amedy Coulibaly\xe2\x80\x99s machine gun came through Belgium, as the Walloon media have reported, or that his partner Hayat Boumeddiene fled to Syria under the nose of law enforcement.'b'Second, the massive waves of immigration, both legal and clandestine, our country has experienced for decades have prevented the implementation of a proper assimilation policy. As Hugues Lagrange, a sociologist at the French National Center for Scientific Research (C.N.R.S.), has argued, culture has a major influence on the way immigrants relate to French society and its values, on issues such as the status of women and the separation of state and religious authority.'b'Without a policy restricting immigration, it becomes difficult, if not impossible, to fight against communalism and the rise of ways of life at odds with la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9, France\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive form of secularism, and other laws and values of the French Republic. An additional burden is mass unemployment, which is itself exacerbated by immigration.'b'Third, French foreign policy has wandered between Scylla and Charybdis in the last few years. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy\xe2\x80\x99s intervention in Libya, President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s support for some Syrian fundamentalists, alliances formed with rentier states that finance jihadist fighters, like Qatar and Saudi Arabia \xe2\x80\x94 all are mistakes that have plunged France into serious geopolitical incoherence from which it is struggling to extricate itself. Incidentally, Gerd M\xc3\xbcller, Germany\xe2\x80\x99s federal minister of economic cooperation and development, deserves praise for having the clear-sightedness, like the Front National, of accusing Qatar of supporting jihadists in Iraq.'b'These mistakes are not inevitable. But to rectify them, we must act quickly. The Union Pour Un Mouvement Populaire and the Parti Socialiste have called for a committee to investigate the recent terrorist attacks. That will hardly solve matters. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you want to bury a problem, set up a committee,\xe2\x80\x9d the French statesman Georges Cl\xc3\xa9menceau once said.'b'For now, one emergency measure can readily be put into action: Stripping jihadists of their French citizenship is an absolute necessity. In the longer run, most important, national border checks must be reinstated, and there should be zero tolerance for any behavior that undermines la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9 and French law. Without such measures, no serious policy for combating fundamentalism is possible.'b'France has just gone through 12 days it will never forget. After pausing to grieve its dead, it then rose up to defend its rights. Now the French people, as if a single person, must put pressure on their leaders so that these days in January will not have been in vain. From France\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy must spring hope for real change. The petty logic of political parties cannot be allowed to stifle the French people\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate aspirations to safety and liberty.'b'We, the French, are viscerally attached to our la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9, our sovereignty, our independence, our values. The world knows that when France is attacked it is liberty that is dealt a blow. I began by saying that we must call things by their names. I will end by saying that some names speak for themselves. The name of our country, France, still rings out like a call to freedom.'b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94 \xc2\xab Mal nommer les choses, c\xe2\x80\x99est ajouter au malheur du monde. \xc2\xbb Qu\xe2\x80\x99Albert Camus l\xe2\x80\x99ait prononc\xc3\xa9e ou non, cette phrase d\xc3\xa9crit \xc3\xa9tonnamment bien la situation dans laquelle se trouve l\xe2\x80\x99actuel gouvernement de la France.

No burned tobacco leaves, no cancer-causing tar: a public health revolution in waiting.'b'The problem is, not enough smokers are switching to e-cigarettes, despite their relative safety \xe2\x80\x94 and understandably so. Smokers are barraged with news about inaccurate labeling, shoddy counterfeits and poorly made e-cigarettes that emit toxins and cancer-causing chemicals in vapor. And to the frustration of smokers, public health experts and, yes, manufacturers, the Food and Drug Administration, which has not yet set up sensible regulations, is making the situation worse.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that the initial public enthusiasm over e-cigarettes is waning: A 'b'report'b' last year in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine showed that while nearly 85 percent of smokers believed that e-cigarettes were safer than cigarettes in 2010, that number had dropped to 65 percent in 2013.'b'Quality concerns are likely to keep rising: This year Chinese manufacturers, the most frequent culprit in safety oversight, are expected to ship more than 300 million e-cigarettes to the United States and Europe. Many of these products will be perfectly safe; the issue is that, so far, we lack an effective regulatory regime to distinguish the good from the bad.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that the F.D.A. has been idle. Last year it proposed a \xe2\x80\x9cdeeming rule\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 in effect, a blueprint for a regulatory framework for e-cigarettes. But given the avalanche of public comments (more than 135,000) and the importance of getting it right, a regulatory pathway will not be cleared anytime soon.'b'Consider the complexity. The proposal has some useful provisions, such as a ban on sale to minors and a requirement to disclose ingredients. But the proposal would also push e-cigarettes into the hugely burdensome regulatory framework that Congress set up for any new tobacco product.'b'That would be a mistake. To appreciate the extent of the unnecessary burden, consider \xe2\x80\x9cpre-market review.\xe2\x80\x9d Companies would have to demonstrate not only that each specific product was beneficial to intended users (adult smokers), but they would also have to show the consequences to teens and nonsmokers. Gathering these data would be vastly time consuming and expensive: According to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s own estimates, conducting the necessary scientific investigations and preparing a pre-market application would take on average more than 5,000 hours and cost more than $300,000.'b'Only the large tobacco producers would be able to shoulder these costs, driving many of the 450 or so small e-cigarette makers from the market. This would suppress the innovation that\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to expanding, refining and enhancing the safety and appeal of e-cigarettes.'b'Pre-market review is commonly used to prove that very risky products, like drugs, medical devices, pesticides and aircraft engines, aren\xe2\x80\x99t harmful. But the point of e-cigarettes is not that they are safe, but that they are significantly safer than cigarettes.'b'Instead of waiting years to develop burdensome regulations, the F.D.A. should act now by setting interim safety guidelines. These guidelines would not carry the force of law, but they could go far to bolster smokers\xe2\x80\x99 confidence that a safer way to inhale nicotine exists.'b'The agency should start by focusing on a few basic steps. It should outline basic good-manufacturing practices for the devices and liquids, including limits on the amount of chemicals, like formaldehyde, and metals, like nickel, that can be present in the aerosols. It should disallow outright some contaminants in the nicotine solution and flavorings.'b'It should require manufacturers to ensure that all batches of chemicals are traceable and that all sources of hardware are known. The guidelines should also require makers to verify that e-cigarette batteries can be charged safely and that they will operate safely in the course of normal use. Interim guidelines should require manufacturers to use childproof packaging that carries a warning: \xe2\x80\x9cThis product contains nicotine, which is addictive and is intended for adult smokers only.\xe2\x80\x9d Also, a mechanism for reporting adverse effects is needed.'b'Finally, the F.D.A. should allow companies to tell smokers about the benefits of switching to vaping products. Labels could read: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile more research is needed, it is likely that e-cigarettes meeting F.D.A. interim safety guidelines are much safer than smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such minimal standards are overdue. The longer it takes the F.D.A. to set them, the longer smokers risk confusion about the virtues of switching \xe2\x80\x94 and keep inhaling deadly smoke.'b'TUCSON \xe2\x80\x94 IN December 2011, a wild gray wolf set foot in California, the first sighting in almost a century. He\xe2\x80\x99d wandered in from Oregon, looking for a mate. In October 2014, for the first time in almost three-quarters of a century, a gray wolf was seen loping along the forested North Rim of the Grand Canyon, in Arizona. She had walked hundreds of miles, probably from Wyoming or Idaho.'b'The return of these animals to the homes of their ancestors \xe2\x80\x94 however fleeting \xe2\x80\x94 was a result of their 40-year protection under the Endangered Species Act.'b'OR-7, or \xe2\x80\x9cJourney,\xe2\x80\x9d as schoolchildren named the first wolf, had been born to the Imnaha pack, the first one in Oregon for many decades. When he wandered south, his brother, OR-9, wandered east. Shortly after he crossed into Idaho (where wolves are not protected), he was shot dead. OR-7 lived on, after his repeated incursions into California (where wolves are protected), to sire a litter of pups just north of the state line. He became the subject of a 'b'documentary'b' \xe2\x80\x94 in California, even a wolf can be a star.'b'The story of the Grand Canyon wolf, though, may be over: Three days after Christmas, it appears, she was 'b'shot and killed'b' in Utah by a man media outlets have called a \xe2\x80\x9ccoyote hunter.\xe2\x80\x9d (A DNA test is pending.)'b'For almost two centuries, American gray wolves, vilified in fact as well as fiction, were the victims of vicious government extermination programs. By the time the Endangered Species Act was passed, in 1973, only a few hundred of these once-great predators were left in the lower 48 states. After numerous generations of people dedicated to killing wolves on the North American continent, one generation devoted itself to letting wolves live. The animals\xe2\x80\x99 number has now risen to almost 5,500, thanks to their legal protection, but they still occupy less than 5 percent of their ancient home range.'b'Since 1995, the act has guided efforts to raise wolves in captivity, release them, and follow them in the wild. Twenty years ago this month, the first gray wolves were 'b'reintroduced'b' to Yellowstone National Park.'b'But this fragile progress has been undermined. Since 2011, the federal government has moved to remove federal protection for gray wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountains (Idaho, Montana and Wyoming) and in the western Great Lakes (Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan), the two population centers. Management of the species was turned over to these states, which responded with a zeal that looks like blood lust.'b'Relying on the greatly exaggerated excuse that wolves threaten cattle and sheep, the states opened their doors to the killing of wolves. (In some states, bait can be used to lure the animals to their deaths; in Montana, private landowners can each kill 100 wolves each year; in Wisconsin, up to six hunting dogs on a single wolf is considered fair play.) Legions of wolf killers rose to the challenge, and the toll has been devastating: In just three and a half years, at least 3,500 wolves have been mowed down.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s been an outcry from conservationists, ecologists and people who simply like wolves, but this has not stopped the killers. Some say wolves are a threat to their livestock investments (despite the existence of generous rancher-compensation programs in all wolf states save Alaska); others invoke fear of wolves; still others appear to revel in killing. Online, you can find pictures of wolf carcasses held up proudly as trophies and men boasting of running over wolves with their cars. Judges have started to step in. In September, a federal court decided that wolf management in Wyoming \xe2\x80\x94 which had allowed people to kill as many wolves as they wanted, throughout 84 percent of the state \xe2\x80\x94 should be returned to the federal government. In December, also in response to a lawsuit, another federal court reinstated protections for wolves in the western Great Lakes. These decisions should make clear that the states alone simply can\xe2\x80\x99t be entrusted with the future of our wolves.'b'In Washington, the threats persist. The Fish and Wildlife Service is considering a proposal that would strip federal protection from almost all gray wolves in the lower 48 states, not just the ones in the Rockies and the Midwest. Meanwhile, right-wing Republicans in the new Congress are 'b'champing at the bit'b' to remove the wolves from protection under the act \xe2\x80\x94 politics trumping science.'b'President Obama should direct the Fish and Wildlife Service to retain protection for wolves; if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t, they could be wiped off the face of the American landscape forever. A unified wolf-recovery plan for the nation is required. Not only do wolves play an important role in keeping wilderness wild, but they were here long before we were, and deserve to remain. Not for nothing was the environmentalist Aldo Leopold transformed by the sight of a \xe2\x80\x9cfierce green fire\xe2\x80\x9d in a dying wolf\xe2\x80\x99s eyes.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen wild gray wolves only once, as they trotted across a dirt road in front of my own family car in a New Mexican forest. There were three of them on the road, no doubt a wolf family, and three of us in the car: my husband, my daughter and me. In the back seat, my little girl was engrossed in a picture book and didn\xe2\x80\x99t look up fast enough. I want her to have another chance; I want her to keep living in a world where something beautiful and wild lurks at the edge of sight.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s now official: 2014 was 'b'the warmest year on record'b'. You might expect this to be a politically important milestone. After all, climate change deniers have long used the blip of 'b'1998'b' \xe2\x80\x94 an unusually hot year, mainly due to an upwelling of warm water in the Pacific \xe2\x80\x94 to claim that the planet has stopped warming. This claim involves a complete misunderstanding of how one goes about identifying underlying trends. (Hint: Don\xe2\x80\x99t cherry-pick your observations.) But now even that bogus argument has collapsed. So will the deniers now concede that climate change is real?'b'Of course not. Evidence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter for the \xe2\x80\x9cdebate\xe2\x80\x9d over climate policy, where I put scare quotes around \xe2\x80\x9cdebate\xe2\x80\x9d because, given the obvious irrelevance of logic and evidence, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a debate in any normal sense. And this situation is by no means unique. Indeed, at this point it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to think of a major policy dispute where facts actually do matter; it\xe2\x80\x99s unshakable dogma, across the board. And the real question is why.'b'Before I get into that, let me remind you of some other news that won\xe2\x80\x99t matter.'b'First, consider the Kansas experiment. Back in 2012 Sam Brownback, the state\xe2\x80\x99s right-wing governor, went all in on supply-side economics: He drastically cut taxes, assuring everyone that the resulting boom would make up for the initial loss in revenues. Unfortunately for his constituents, his experiment has been 'b'a resounding failure'b'. The economy of Kansas, far from booming, has lagged the economies of neighboring states, and Kansas is now in fiscal crisis.'b'So will we see conservatives scaling back their claims about the magical efficacy of tax cuts as a form of economic stimulus? Of course not. If evidence mattered, supply-side economics would have faded into obscurity decades ago. Instead, it has only strengthened its grip on the Republican Party.'b'Meanwhile, the news on health reform keeps coming in, and it keeps being more favorable than even the supporters expected. We already knew that the number of Americans without insurance is dropping fast, even as the growth in health care costs moderates. Now we have evidence that the number of Americans experiencing 'b'financial distress due to medical expenses'b' is also dropping fast.'b'All this is utterly at odds with dire predictions that reform would lead to declining coverage and soaring costs. So will we see any of the people claiming that Obamacare is doomed to utter failure revising their position? You know the answer.'b'And the list goes on. On issues that range from monetary policy to the control of infectious disease, a big chunk of America\xe2\x80\x99s body politic holds views that are completely at odds with, and completely unmovable by, actual experience. And no matter the issue, it\xe2\x80\x99s the same chunk. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten involved in any of these debates, you know that these people aren\xe2\x80\x99t happy warriors; they\xe2\x80\x99re red-faced angry, with special rage directed at know-it-alls who snootily point out that the facts don\xe2\x80\x99t support their position.'b'The question, as I said at the beginning, is why. Why the dogmatism? Why the rage? And why do these issues go together, with the set of people insisting that climate change is a hoax pretty much the same as the set of people insisting that any attempt at providing universal health insurance must lead to disaster and tyranny?'b'Well, it strikes me that the immovable position in each of these cases is bound up with rejecting any role for government that serves the public interest. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the government to impose controls or fees on polluters, you want to deny that there is any reason to limit emissions. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the combination of regulation, mandates and subsidies that is needed to extend coverage to the uninsured, you want to deny that expanding coverage is even possible. And claims about the magical powers of tax cuts are often little more than a mask for the real agenda of crippling government by starving it of revenue.'b'And why this hatred of government in the public interest? Well, the political scientist Corey Robin argues that most self-proclaimed conservatives are actually 'b'reactionaries'b'. That is, they\xe2\x80\x99re defenders of traditional hierarchy \xe2\x80\x94 the kind of hierarchy that is threatened by any expansion of government, even (or perhaps especially) when that expansion makes the lives of ordinary citizens better and more secure. I\xe2\x80\x99m partial to that story, partly because it helps explain why climate science and health economics inspire so much rage.'b'Whether this is the right explanation or not, the fact is that we\xe2\x80\x99re living in a political era in which facts don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that those of us who care about evidence should stop seeking it out. But we should be realistic in our expectations, and not expect even the most decisive evidence to make much difference.'b'Earlier this month, the Pew Research Center 'b'released a study'b' that found that most wealthy Americans believed \xe2\x80\x9cpoor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is an infuriatingly obtuse view of what it means to be poor in this country \xe2\x80\x94 the soul-rending omnipresence of worry and fear, of weariness and fatigue. This can be the view only of those who have not known \xe2\x80\x94 or have long forgotten \xe2\x80\x94 what poverty truly means.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEasy\xe2\x80\x9d is a word not easily spoken among the poor. Things are hard \xe2\x80\x94 the times are hard, the work is hard, the way is hard. \xe2\x80\x9cEasy\xe2\x80\x9d is for uninformed explanations issued by the willfully callous and the haughtily blind.'b'Allow me to explain, as James Baldwin put it, a few illustrations of \xe2\x80\x9chow extremely expensive it is to be poor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'First, many poor people work, but they just don\xe2\x80\x99t make enough to move out of poverty \xe2\x80\x94 an 'b'estimated 11 million Americans'b' fall into this category.'b'So, as the Pew report pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cmore than half of the least secure group reports receiving at least one type of means-tested government benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And yet, whatever the poor earn is likely to be more heavily taxed than the earnings of wealthier citizens, according to a new analysis by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. As The New York Times 'b'put it last week'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAccording to the study, in 2015 the poorest fifth of Americans will pay on average 10.9 percent of their income in state and local taxes, the middle fifth will pay 9.4 percent and the top 1 percent will average 5.4 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In addition, many low-income people are \xe2\x80\x9cunbanked\xe2\x80\x9d (not served by a financial institution), and thus nearly eaten alive by exorbitant fees. As 'b'the St. Louis Federal Reserve pointed out'b' in 2010:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnbanked consumers spend approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of a government benefits check and between 4 percent and 5 percent of payroll check just to cash them. Additional dollars are spent to purchase money orders to pay routine monthly expenses. When you consider the cost for cashing a bi-weekly payroll check and buying about six money orders each month, a household with a net income of $20,000 may pay as much as $1,200 annually for alternative service fees \xe2\x80\x94 substantially more than the expense of a monthly checking account.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even when low-income people can become affiliated with a bank, those banks are increasingly making them pay \xe2\x80\x9csteep rates for loans and high fees on basic checking accounts,\xe2\x80\x9d as 'b'The Times\xe2\x80\x99s DealBook blog'b' put it last year.'b'And poor people can have a hard time getting credit. As 'b'The Washington Post'b' put it, the excesses of the subprime boom have led conventional banks to stay away from the riskiest borrowers, leaving them \xe2\x80\x9call but cut off from access to big loans, like mortgages.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One way to move up the ladder and out of poverty is through higher education, but even that is not without disproportionate costs. As the 'b'Institute for College Access and Success noted'b' in March:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGraduates who received Pell Grants, most of whom had family incomes under $40,000, were much more likely to borrow and to borrow more. Among graduating seniors who ever received a Pell Grant, 88 percent had student loans in 2012, with an average of $31,200 per borrower. In contrast, 53 percent of those who never received a Pell Grant had debt, with an average of $26,450 per borrower.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And often, work or school requires transportation, which can be another outrageous expense. According to the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLow- and moderate-income households spend 42 percent of their total annual income on transportation, including those who live in rural areas, as compared to middle-income households, who spend less than 22 percent of their annual income on transportation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And besides, having a car can make prime targets of the poor. One 'b'pernicious practice'b' that the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. \xe2\x80\x94 and the protests that followed \xe2\x80\x94 resurfaced was the degree to which some local municipalities profit from police departments targeting poor communities, with a raft of stops, fines, summonses and arrests supported by police actions and complicit courts.'b''b'As NPR reported'b' in August:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn 2013, the municipal court in Ferguson \xe2\x80\x94 a city of 21,135 people \xe2\x80\x94 issued 32,975 arrest warrants for nonviolent offenses, mostly driving violations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The story continued:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-area public defender group, says in its report that more than half the courts in St. Louis County engage in the \xe2\x80\x98illegal and harmful practices\xe2\x80\x99 of charging high court fines and fees on nonviolent offenses like traffic violations \xe2\x80\x94 and then arresting people when they don\xe2\x80\x99t pay.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The list of hardships could go on for several more columns, but you get the point: Being poor is anything but easy.'b'The Florida judiciary is no stranger to misconduct and corruption. During 'b'one tawdry stretch'b' in the early 1970s, three of the state\xe2\x80\x99s supreme court justices resigned over corruption scandals. One was caught on a gambling junket in Las Vegas that had been paid for by a greyhound track owner with a case pending before the court. Two others stepped down after trying to tamper with cases involving campaign supporters.'b'In response to 'b'these and other embarrassments'b', Florida passed significant reforms, including a law banning judicial candidates from personally asking potential campaign donors for money. Like similar laws in 29 of the other 38 states where at least some judges are elected, it was a straightforward way to reduce a serious threat to judicial independence.'b'And yet this law may soon become the latest victim of the post-Citizens United era, where money is speech and more of it is only better.'b'On Tuesday, the United States Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in a 'b'case'b' challenging Florida\xe2\x80\x99s personal-solicitation ban as a violation of the First Amendment. The lawsuit was brought by Lanell Williams-Yulee, a lawyer who was disciplined for writing, signing and sending a fund-raising letter to voters in 2009, when she was running to be a county court judge.'b'The Florida Supreme Court upheld the law, as has every other state supreme court to consider such a challenge. Federal appeals courts have split on the question.'b'Opponents of the law 'b'say'b' it restricts political speech that is at the heart of the First Amendment. They agree that states have a compelling interest in protecting judicial independence, but argue that the ban on direct requests for cash is futile, since candidates may still establish fund-raising committees and express their gratitude to individual donors. They say judges can always recuse themselves from problematic cases, and that existing contribution limits reduce the risk of corruption.'b'But the decision to recuse is generally left up to the individual judge, and the survival of remaining contribution limits under the current Supreme Court is far from certain.'b'More to the point, most people believe that campaign donations influence a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s conduct once in office. In one 'b'recent poll'b', 87 percent of voters said campaign contributions and spending by independent groups affect judicial decisions, and 'b'almost half'b' of state judges themselves agree. Research backs up those instincts: For example, 'b'a 2013 study'b' found that the more business interests donated to judicial campaigns, the more likely judges were to issue pro-business rulings.'b'Given the increasing supremacy of money in judicial campaigns, bans on direct, personal requests for cash do not seem so restrictive. In Florida, for instance, supreme court justices 'b'raised'b' a total of $7,500 in campaign funds between 2000 and 2010. In 2014, the three justices facing retention elections raised $1.5 million.'b'Free speech is a core American value, but so are due process and an independent judiciary. Judges, even elected ones, are not lawmakers or political leaders, and should not be put in the position of acting like them. Judges simply cannot seem impartial when they have to ask for money from the same people who appear before them in court. As one Ohio Supreme Court justice 'b'put it'b', \xe2\x80\x9cI never felt so much like a hooker down by the bus station in any race I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been in as I did in a judicial race.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Appointing judges through a merit-based process, as happens in the federal system, would avoid the significant dangers of campaign-based corruption. But as long as 90 percent of state judges around the country are elected, and as long as the Supreme Court continues to allow ever more money to flow into all elections, states must be able to respond with reasonable and targeted measures that combat the improper influence of that money. There is no other way to protect the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in its judges.'b'The recent terrorist attacks in Paris prompted millions to take to the streets to show national solidarity and to pay tribute to the 17 people murdered. The attacks have also inspired a lot of soul-searching, as the French struggle to understand how three men, born and raised in France, could have trained the murderous intent of Al Qaeda and the Islamic State on their own countrymen. And the attacks have revealed a larger, existential threat to France: that its social compact may be torn apart by sectarian polarization.'b'The profiles of the three attackers \xe2\x80\x94 Amedy Coulibaly and the brothers Ch\xc3\xa9rif and Sa\xc3\xafd Kouachi \xe2\x80\x94 are an indictment of the decades-long failure of France to address long-festering alienation and exclusion among too many Muslim immigrants and their French-born children. Unemployment is as high as 'b'40 percent among youths'b' in France\xe2\x80\x99s disadvantaged neighborhoods. All three attackers grew up in poverty. Ch\xc3\xa9rif Kouachi and Mr. Coulibaly spent time in prison. All ultimately found deadly purpose in Islamist terrorism.'b'Prison was the crucible of their radicalization. There are five million to six million Muslims in France, less than 10 percent of the total population, but 60 percent of France\xe2\x80\x99s prison inmates are of \xe2\x80\x9cMuslim culture or religion,\xe2\x80\x9d according to a report presented to France\xe2\x80\x99s National Assembly. It was in prison that Mr. Kouachi and Mr. Coulibaly met the Qaeda recruiter Djamel Beghal. To stem recruiting by Islamist extremists in prisons, the government of President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande has announced it will seek to isolate identified Islamist proselytizers from other prisoners.'b'There is also the problem of France\xe2\x80\x99s secularism. A ban on head scarves in public schools and on full-face veils feels to many Muslims like an unfair constraint on their religious freedom. Some also find it hard to accept that blasphemy is not a crime in France, and that Charlie Hebdo and other publications have a right to satirize religious leaders. Some students in French schools with large immigrant and Muslim populations refused to participate in the national minute of silence following the Charlie Hebdo attack because they objected to what they had heard about the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s depictions of the Prophet Muhammad.'b'As of mid-December, 621 citizens and residents of France were running off to fight in Syria and Iraq or were already there, according to the government. Many of them are young and self-radicalized, having fallen prey to slick films \xe2\x80\x94 produced by the Islamic State and other jihadist groups and disseminated on social media \xe2\x80\x94 that glorify jihad as the ultimate rebellion against parental and societal expectations. The Hollande government has tried to deal with this phenomenon by passing a law that restricts travel abroad by would-be jihadists, but it must also use the current crisis to find engaging alternatives for people who might find refuge in the jihadist message.'b'French Muslims, who are as scared of terrorists as everybody else, also have to fear anti-Islam prejudice and attacks. There were 60 recorded threats and attacks against Muslims during the six days following the Jan. 7 attack on Charlie Hebdo. There is a real danger the right-wing National Front will seek political advantage by fueling anti-Muslim hysteria.'b'At a visit to the Institut du Monde Arabe on Thursday, President Hollande assured France\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims that hate crimes would be punished and that the government would protect Muslims, as it would all French citizens. France\xe2\x80\x99s minister of education, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, who is French-Moroccan, is to announce new measures on Monday to better explain French \xe2\x80\x9crepublican values\xe2\x80\x9d in the schools. For the lesson to work, the Hollande government must find ways to make those values a reality for the many French youths who feel marginalized from French society.'b'There is much to like in the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, announced last Wednesday, to reduce harmful methane emissions from oil and gas drilling. The proposal \xe2\x80\x94 which calls for detailed rules to be unveiled in early summer \xe2\x80\x94 is the first federal effort to directly regulate methane, the main component of natural gas and a major contributor to climate change. The regulations will apply to all new oil and gas wells, and be national in scope, thus setting minimum standards for what is now a patchwork quilt of state laws.'b'They will make a dent in the billions of cubic feet of gas that now escape unchecked into the atmosphere. But only a dent. Officials at the Environmental Protection Agency said their goal was to cut methane emissions by between 40 and 45 percent in the next decade, a laudable ambition. But rules that apply only to new facilities, as these do, won\xe2\x80\x99t do the trick; over the next five years, 90 percent of methane emissions are expected to come from existing oil and gas operations.'b'The agency said it hoped for voluntary measures to modernize existing operations. But if history is any guide, mandatory regulation of some sort will almost certainly be necessary. The natural gas industry in particular has been alarmingly slow to clean up its act despite widespread public concern over the threats to air and water quality presented by the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing.'b'Methane accounts for about 9 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions in this country. But its chemical properties make it a more potent trapper of heat than carbon dioxide, by far the main greenhouse gas. Although methane is also produced by agricultural operations and other sources like landfills, the easiest leaks to control are those that occur in the drilling and transmission of natural gas, and, to a lesser extent, oil. These emissions are expected to rise substantially as industry exploits new and old deposits through hydraulic fracturing and as the preferred fuel for power plants gradually shifts from coal to natural gas.'b'President Obama promised to address methane emissions last March as part of his broader climate action plan. Controlling methane is one of the last missing pieces of his climate strategy, which already includes much stronger fuel economy standards for vehicles and proposed rules governing carbon dioxide emissions from new and existing power plants. He cannot meet his pledge of reducing America\xe2\x80\x99s greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025 without tackling methane. Though inadequate, the new plan is a welcome and necessary step toward that goal.'b'Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s voters shocked themselves and the world this month by tossing out their president, who crushed the Tamil insurgency in 2009 and then led the country, along with his brother as defense secretary, to the brink of authoritarianism. The new president has promised to restore freedom of the press, independence of judges, and the rights of religious and ethnic minorities.'b'Democracy advocates, including Secretary of State John Kerry, say this is the country\xe2\x80\x99s most important chance  to open a new chapter in more than a decade.'b'But the country must make sure that members of the ousted regime do not return to power and that the new government can secure its authority. The United States \xe2\x80\x94 and only the United States \xe2\x80\x94 can do something to help make that happen.'b'The former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, and his brother, Gotabaya Rajapaksa, aren\xe2\x80\x99t politically dead yet. Critical parliamentary elections are scheduled for April. The new president, Maithripala Sirisena, rode to electoral victory on the back of a diverse group of parties. He must now consolidate his power so that democratic reform can  go ahead.'b'What can the United States do to help? Mr. Kerry said the United States would take up longstanding human rights concerns with the new government. The State Department has spearheaded the creation of a United Nations investigation into war crimes committed under the Rajapaksa regime during the country\xe2\x80\x99s civil war, which lasted from 1983 to 2009.'b'But that inquiry offers both too much and too little at this point. Too much,  because pushing for full, sweeping accountability in this fragile moment of transition could destabilize the new government and jeopardize the warming of relations between the United States and Sri Lanka. Too little, because the United Nations investigation doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have any teeth \xe2\x80\x94 the panel leading it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the powers of a criminal tribunal, and cannot even impose a financial penalty.'b'Here is where Washington can play a constructive role.'b'Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the former defense secretary, oversaw the Sri Lankan armed forces\xe2\x80\x99 worst atrocities during the final stages of the civil war and, as it happens, he is a naturalized American citizen. (Indeed, he used to live in Los Angeles, where he worked as a computer systems operator at  Loyola Law School.)'b'As a citizen, Mr. Rajapaksa can be held liable under the War Crimes Act  of 1996, which puts war crimes anywhere in the world under the jurisdiction of United States courts if the perpetrator, or the victim, is a United States citizen. Put another way, the United States has a perfect justification to go after Mr. Rajapaksa individually.'b'Independent observers have long viewed Gotabaya Rajapaksa as an obstacle, perhaps even more than his brother, to a smooth political transition in Sri Lanka. There is little indication that he will respect the new government, which has opened an investigation to look into widely reported allegations that he and his brother attempted to engineer a military coup to overturn the election results.'b'It is in the new government\xe2\x80\x99s interest to move decisively to protect its democratic victory by eliminating the threat  of Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s return to power.  That is a distinct possibility if his brother, Mahinda, succeeds in a bid to maintain control over the powerful opposition party.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why marginalizing Mr. Rajapaksa now is important. The new president, Mr. Sirisena, has signaled that he is open to domestic criminal prosecutions to ward off foreign war crimes trials. And the president\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman has indicated that the government may be willing to prosecute specific war crimes, such as the so-called White Flag incident, in which surrendering Tamil leaders with white flags were allegedly executed by soldiers on the final day of the civil war. That\xe2\x80\x99s a highly significant statement because, as many Sri Lankans know, and as the State Department reported to Congress, the army chief at the time said that Mr. Rajapaksa gave the order \xe2\x80\x9cthey must all be killed,\xe2\x80\x9d and later added that he would be willing to testify in a war crimes trial.'b'But proceeding against Mr. Rajapaksa will be politically challenging for the new Sri Lankan government to do on its own. The United States could help by signaling its own interest in opening a criminal case against Mr.  Rajapaksa in the event that Sri Lanka doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. That would give the new government both an opportunity and a justification to clean its house. Because of Mr. Rajapaksa\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship, the United States would also be less vulnerable to accusations that it was meddling in the affairs of another nation.'b'The Obama administration might even say, in a very public way, that it will decide whether to proceed with its own criminal inquiry after giving Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s new establishment an opportunity to move first. Such signals from the United States could help politically marginalize the Rajapaksas at a critical point in the life of the country. They would also bolster President Sirisena\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to have the country repudiate the past and recognize that its best future lies with his administration. The United States should do its part to bring accountability to Sri Lanka and assist its transition to democracy.'b''b'\n'b'Ryan Goodman 'b' is a professor of law, politics and sociology at New York University and co-editor in chief of the blog Just Security.

The former is an accepted, lawful method of marketing consumer goods and services. The latter is an illegal business operation that should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'b'Hundreds of direct selling firms in the United States (sometimes referred to as multilevel marketers) that are members of the Direct Selling Association are progressive companies with sound business practices that provide opportunities to millions around the globe. These companies, including Herbalife, have committed themselves to the highest level of marketplace ethics and a rigorous self-regulatory code.'b'We should consider the consequences to the individuals who sell and consume their products \xe2\x80\x94 and the communities their parent companies serve \xe2\x80\x94 before placing scarlet letters upon their legitimate businesses.'b'JOSEPH N. MARIANO'b'\nPresident'b'\nDirect Selling Association'b'\nWashington, Jan. 13, 2015'b''b''b''b'IN the last 40 years, more than one billion acres of tropical forests have vanished, equivalent in size to over half of the continental United States. The rate of cutting, burning and clearing shows no signs of abating.'b'Tropical forests store huge amounts of carbon. When their trees are cut or burned, the carbon is eventually released into the atmosphere, mixing with oxygen to form the long-lasting greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. The pace of deforestation is so great today that it accounts for an estimated 12 to 15 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions annually.'b'Economic forces drive this destruction \xe2\x80\x94 for timber, rangeland, mining and development. But there is also a powerful economic argument for preservation. Forests\xe2\x80\x99 carbon reserves can be monetized and sold as offsets to greenhouse gas emitters who need them to comply with regulatory emissions limits, or who voluntarily want to reduce their carbon footprint.'b'These offsets typically are sold by utilities or other industrial companies that have reduced their emissions below a government-imposed cap. The offsets equal the emissions below the cap; their price is determined by supply and demand. The buyers are companies whose emissions are above the cap; the offsets are subtracted from their excess emissions, enabling them to avoid penalties. There is also a voluntary market where companies and individuals buy offsets to reduce their carbon footprint. The revenue is used to finance energy efficiency and other projects to reduce emissions.'b'These markets are booming, with trades each year in the tens of billions of dollars. But a potential pool of offsets has been largely left off the table \xe2\x80\x94 offsets that represent carbon emissions 'b'avoided 'b'by not destroying tropical forests. These were difficult to value because there was no way to accurately quantify the carbon savings. Nor were there reliable, transparent systems to ensure these forests would remain standing or that proceeds would be returned to local communities.'b'For those reasons, the European Union, which has the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest system for trading carbon offsets, has not allowed offsets for what\xe2\x80\x99s known as avoided deforestation. Other carbon markets, like the one run by the California Air Resources Board, are considering it.'b'The objections are now being addressed. In recent years, accurate and inexpensive techniques have been developed to quantify and verify carbon emissions that would be avoided by not destroying forests. Credible mechanisms for indemnifying offset credits (meaning, an acre of forest will always be protected even if the specific acre behind the credit is destroyed) and returning the proceeds from the sale of the offsets to local communities have also been devised. A new system that combines all of those components and biodiversity conservation, known as the 'b'Rainforest Standard'b', which we and 60 other scientists, lawyers and businesspeople have developed, is now being tested in South America to safeguard a 1.6-million-acre forest.'b'Although this expanse is designated a \xe2\x80\x9cprotected area,\xe2\x80\x9d it has only four guards. This is not unusual. In the Amazon and elsewhere, there\xe2\x80\x99s not enough money to adequately safeguard protected forests from threats like illegal logging and ranching. This is where forest offsets can make a real difference. Allowing them to be traded would give carbon reserves tangible value that could be sold for real money, which could be used to protect these biologically diverse forests.'b'The added benefit is that saving a tropical forest of, say, a million acres would prevent roughly 367 million tons of carbon dioxide from escaping into the atmosphere, where some of it would remain for thousands of years.'b'In our pilot project, a major corporation has agreed to buy one million offset credits over 20 years. All of the money will underwrite a trust fund to manage and protect the forest and help local communities develop sustainable livelihoods such as eco-tourism, fish farming and beekeeping.'b'A second, smaller project has just started in Southeast Asia, and we are working to replicate these projects elsewhere.'b'Corporations in growing numbers understand what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake. In September, 40 major companies, including Kellogg and Nestl\xc3\xa9, pledged to cut tropical deforestation in half by 2020 and stop it entirely by 2030. The group included some of the largest companies handling palm oil, which vow to impose tough standards on production, limiting activities that are devastating old-growth tropical forests, especially in Southeast Asia.'b'Offsets, whether compulsory or voluntary, can be another tool for protecting tropical forests. The European Union and other carbon markets should reconsider their policies. These forests can have a worth beyond the value of their plunder as governments and industries turn to market-based solutions to slow the warming of our planet.'b'The state of the union, food-wise, is not good. The best evidence is that more than 46.5 million Americans are receiving SNAP benefits \xe2\x80\x94 formerly food stamps \xe2\x80\x94 a number that 'b'has not changed much'b' since 2013, when it reached its highest level ever.'b'Even if you allow for fraud, 'b'which barely exists'b' (imagine being so desperate that you\xe2\x80\x99d risk imprisonment for $130 a month; I doubt you can), the number would be far higher if everyone who was eligible knew it, if pride and stigma were not issues and if it were easier to enroll. Still, 15 percent of the nation is bad enough; it\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 'b'equivalent to the population of Spain'b'.'b'Yet when you look at the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Your Feedback'b'\xe2\x80\x9d page on the White House website, among the 16 suggested topics on what the administration should address in its last two years, the word \xe2\x80\x9cfood\xe2\x80\x9d is used precisely zero times. No surprise, because 'b'President Obama'b' has been steadfastly short-sighted about this. (He has not been blind, and compared to his predecessor he\xe2\x80\x99s been downright brilliant. But you need a better yardstick than W. by which to measure presidents.)'b'As 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve written before'b', there are no hungry people with money. I\xe2\x80\x99m all for the administration\xe2\x80\x99s stated goal of boosting income for the least well-off, but raising the minimum wage in minimal fashion is not going to cut it, because its value, adjusted for inflation, is only marginally up from the all-time low. Even a raise to $10 'b'would not bring it to its 1968 value'b', which is why the cry for a national minimum of $15 makes so much sense.'b'So does the establishment of a national food policy, something on which we can hope the new White House senior policy adviser for nutrition policy, 'b'Deb Eschmeyer'b', can focus. Because the issues that confront most Americans directly are income, food (thereby, agriculture), health and 'b'climate change'b'. (And, of course, war, but let\xe2\x80\x99s leave that aside for now.)'b'These are all related: You can\xe2\x80\x99t address climate change without fixing agriculture, you can\xe2\x80\x99t fix health without improving diet, you can\xe2\x80\x99t improve diet without addressing income, and so on. The production, marketing and consumption of food is key to nearly everything. (It\xe2\x80\x99s one of the keys to war, too, because large-scale agriculture is dependent on control of global land, oil, minerals and water.)'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s hands are famously tied by Congress, though not entirely. He has shown resolve on immigration, on Keystone XL and on climate change in general \xe2\x80\x94 his new 'b'rules on methane'b' are tame but welcome, especially given 'b'the increasing power of loony climate-change deniers'b' in the Senate. Although we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the endgame here, at least there\xe2\x80\x99s a welcome willingness to fight.'b'But we need Obama to show that same resolve in defending SNAP, because as usual 'b'the program is under siege'b' \xe2\x80\x94 despite the fact that the number of people eligible for food stamps has not declined during the so-called economic recovery, which has been 'b'largely meaningless'b' for the vast majority of Americans.'b'In fact, as the economy \xe2\x80\x9crecovers,\xe2\x80\x9d the corporate elite \xe2\x80\x94 who were rescued in 2009 after nearly self-destructing in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 have become richer, while the income of most Americans 'b'has stagnated or declined'b'. (Although real median income is up from its 2011 low, it remains down about 6 percent since 2008. Some recovery.) While raising the minimum wage and addressing income inequality are huge issues, protecting 'b'existing 'b'programs for the less well off is the most important battle right now.'b'In a similar boat are the improvements to the Child Nutrition Act (the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act), which, to President and Mrs. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s credit, are powerful forces for good in the American diet, because by positively influencing eating patterns in young people you positively influence them for life. Yet these progressive dietary steps are 'b'also being attacked by Big Food'b' and its reactionary Congressional allies. Again, it\xe2\x80\x99s critically important to defend this good work.'b'We might hear a word or two about this tonight, but I doubt it. And there are a number of other food-related themes and opportunities for progress that President Obama might mention that he will not. (I will ecstatically apologize if I\xe2\x80\x99m wrong \xe2\x80\x94 not that this matters much.) A promise to develop a 'b'national food policy'b' could ostensibly address all of them at once, but let me single out some crucial issues in most need of attention.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Get antibiotics out of the food supply. The 'b'Food and Drug Administration'b'\xe2\x80\x99s (FDA) voluntary guidelines for reducing those antibiotics given to animals (some 80 percent of all antibiotics in the country, and a leading factor in the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria) should be declared a failure, and a mandatory ban on the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry \xe2\x80\x94 with the exception of treating sick animals, of course \xe2\x80\x94 should be put in place.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Tie reducing greenhouse gas emissions to reining in the industrial production of animals. Regardless of the eminently debatable percentage of GHG emissions attributed to animal production, it\xe2\x80\x99s significant. In my view, the administration has all but ignored this.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Support the strongest front-of-package food labeling that the FDA can possibly develop. There are a number of directions the FDA may go with new product labeling, and one that quantifies the amount of sugar, in language people can actually understand, would be most helpful.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Defend the menu-labeling program that\xe2\x80\x99s mandated under the Affordable Care Act.'b'In preparing to write this piece, I asked some friends and colleagues (Raj Patel, Marion Nestle, Scott Faber, Ricardo Salvador, Michael Pollan and a few others) to suggest what I might include. Nestle\xe2\x80\x99s response \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cMake sure that no American goes hungry\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 pretty much sums up the priorities of everyone who responded. And I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say that all of us are in at least general agreement on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve written above. If not, I\xe2\x80\x99ll hear from the dissenters, trust me, and post those notes on my blog.'b'But let me quote Pollan on what he\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear the president say:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am expanding the portfolio of my new senior policy adviser for nutrition policy, Deb Eschmeyer, to encompass all the policy areas that food touches: agriculture, nutritional health and environmental health. She will be charged with harmonizing our policies across these three areas, so that, for example, our agricultural policies contribute not just to the prosperity of American farmers but to the health of our people and the land.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All the president has to do tonight is recite that paragraph, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have gained more credibility with advocates of good food than he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to do in his remaining two years in office.'b'All college commencements are happy, but community-college commencements are the happiest of all. Many of the graduates are the first in their extended family to have earned degrees. When their name is read, big cheering sections erupt with horns and roars from the stands.

The graduates often know exactly where they\xe2\x80\x99re going to work; they walk with an extra sense of security as they head off campus.'b'These bright days serve as evidence that America can live up to its dream of social mobility, that there is hope at a time when the ladder upward seems creaky and inadequate.'b'So when President Obama unveils his community-college plan in the State of the Union address Tuesday night, it represents an opportunity \xe2\x80\x94 an opportunity to create days like that for more students.'b'Obama\xe2\x80\x99s headline idea is to make community college free. It would reduce two years of tuition costs to zero for students with decent grades and who graduate within three years.'b'The evidence from a similar program in Tennessee suggests that the simple free label has an important psychological effect. Enrollment there surged when high school students learned that they could go to community college for nothing.'b'The problem is that getting students to enroll is neither hard nor important. The important task is to help students graduate. Community college drop out rates now hover somewhere between 66 percent and 80 percent.'b'Spending $60 billion over 10 years to make community college free will do little to reduce that. In the first place, community college is already free for most poor and working-class students who qualify for Pell grants and other aid. In 2012, 38 percent of community-college students had their tuition covered entirely by grant aid and an additional 33 percent had fees of less than $1,000.'b'The Obama plan would largely be a subsidy for the middle- and upper-middle-class students who are now paying tuition and who could afford to pay it in the years ahead.'b'The smart thing to do would be to scrap the Obama tuition plan. Students who go to community college free now have tragically high dropout rates. The $60 billion could then be spent on things that are mentioned in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal \xe2\x80\x94 but not prioritized or fleshed out \xe2\x80\x94 which would actually increase graduation rates.'b'First, you\xe2\x80\x99d focus on living expenses. Tuition represents only a fifth of the costs of community-college life. The bulk is textbooks, housing, transportation and so on. Students often have to take on full-time or near-full-time jobs to cover the costs, and, once they do that, they\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to lose touch with college.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99d subsidize guidance counselors and mentors. Community colleges are not sticky places. Many students don\xe2\x80\x99t have intimate relationships with anyone who can guide them through the maze of registration, who might help bond them to campus.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99d figure out the remedial education mess. Half of all community-college students arrive unprepared for college work. Remedial courses are supposed to bring them up to speed, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear they work, so some states are dropping remediation, which could leave even more students at sea.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99d focus on child care. A quarter of college students nationwide have dependent children. Even more students at community colleges do. Less than half of community colleges now have any day-care facilities. Many students drop out because something happens at home and there\xe2\x80\x99s no one to take care of the kids.'b'In short, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t write government checks for tuition. You\xe2\x80\x99d strengthen structures around the schools. You\xe2\x80\x99d focus on the lived environment of actual students and create relationships and cushions to help them thrive.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve had two generations of human capital policies. Human Capital 1.0 was designed to give people access to schools and other facilities. It was based on the 1970s liberal orthodoxy that poor people just need more money, that the government could write checks and mobility will improve.'b'Human Capital 2.0 is designed to help people not just enroll but to complete school and thrive. Its based on a much more sophisticated understanding of how people actually live, on the importance of social capital, on the difficulty of living in disorganized circumstances. The new research emphasizes noncognitive skills \xe2\x80\x94 motivation, grit and attachment \xe2\x80\x94 and how to use policy levers to boost these things.'b'The tuition piece of the Obama proposal is Human Capital 1.0. It is locked in 1970s liberal orthodoxy. Congress should take the proposal, scrap it and rededicate the money toward programs that will actually boost completion, that will surround colleges, students and their families with supporting structures. We don\xe2\x80\x99t need another program that will lure students into colleges only to have them struggle and drop out.'b'Last week, several Republican senators, including John McCain, called on President Obama to stop releasing detainees from the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba.

Three years into his detention \xe2\x80\x94 years during which he was isolated, tortured, beaten, sexually abused and humiliated \xe2\x80\x94 Slahi wrote a 466-page, 122,000-word account of what had happened to him up to that point.'b'His manuscript was immediately classified, and it took years of litigation and negotiation by Slahi\xe2\x80\x99s pro bono lawyers to force the military to declassify a redacted version. Even with the redactions, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Guant\xc3\xa1namo Diary'b'\xe2\x80\x9d is an extraordinary document \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cA vision of hell, beyond Orwell, beyond Kafka,\xe2\x80\x9d as John le Carr\xc3\xa9 aptly describes it in a back cover blurb \xe2\x80\x94 that every American should read.'b'A native of Mauritania, Slahi, 44, is fluent in several languages \xe2\x80\x94 he learned English while in Guant\xc3\xa1namo \xe2\x80\x94 and lived in Canada and Germany as well as the Muslim world. He came under suspicion because an Al Qaeda member, who had been based in Montreal \xe2\x80\x94 where Slahi had also lived \xe2\x80\x94 was arrested and charged with plotting to bomb the Los Angeles International Airport in 1999. Slahi was questioned about this plot several times, but he was always released. After 9/11, Slahi was detained again for questioning. That time, he was turned over to the American authorities, in whose captivity he has been ever since.'b'What was he accused of? Slahi asked this question of his captors often and was never given a straight answer. This, of course, is part of the problem with Guant\xc3\xa1namo, a prison where being formally charged with a crime is a luxury, not a requirement. His efforts to tell the truth \xe2\x80\x94 that he had no involvement in any acts of terrorism \xe2\x80\x94 only angered his interrogators. \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like a dog, walks like a dog, smells like a dog, barks like a dog, must be a dog,\xe2\x80\x9d one interrogator used to say. That was the best his captors could do to explain why he was there. Yet the military was so sure he was a key Al Qaeda player that he was subjected to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d techniques that had been signed off by the secretary of defense, Donald Rumsfeld, himself.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpecial interrogation techniques,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, is a euphemism for torture. The sections of the book that describe his torture make for harrowing reading. Slahi was so sleep-deprived that he eventually started to hallucinate. Chained to the ground, he was forced to \xe2\x80\x9cstand\xe2\x80\x9d in positions that were extremely painful. Interrogators went at him in shifts \xe2\x80\x94 24 hours a day. Sometimes during interrogations, female interrogators rubbed their breasts over his body and fondled him.'b'It is hard to read about his torture without feeling a sense of shame.'b'Does Slahi crack? Of course: to get the torture to stop, he finally lied, telling his interrogators what he thought they wanted to hear, just as torture victims have done since the Inquisition. \xe2\x80\x9cTorture doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee that the detainee cooperates,\xe2\x80\x9d writes Slahi. \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to stop torture, the detainee has to please his assailant, even with untruthful, and sometime misleading [intelligence].\xe2\x80\x9d McCain, who was tortured in Vietnam, knows this; last month, he made a powerful speech in which he condemned America\xe2\x80\x99s use of torture, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of torture compromises that which most distinguishes us from our enemies, our belief that all people, even captured enemies, possess basic human rights.\xe2\x80\x9d That is also why it is so disheartening that McCain 'b'has allied himself'b' with those who want to keep Guant\xc3\xa1namo open.'b'In 2010, a federal district judge 'b'ruled in favor of Slahi\xe2\x80\x99s habeas corpus petition'b' because the evidence against him was so thin. The government appealed, and the order remains in limbo.'b'I asked Nancy Hollander, one of Slahi\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers, to describe her client. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is funny, smart, compassionate and thoughtful,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. All of these qualities come through in his memoir, which is surprisingly without rancor. \xe2\x80\x9cI have only written what I experienced, what I saw, and what I learned firsthand,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes toward the end of his book. \xe2\x80\x9cI have tried not to exaggerate, nor to understate. I have tried to be as fair as possible, to the U.S. government, to my brothers, and to myself.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the wonders of the book is that he does come across as fair to all, even his torturers.'b'But the quote that sticks with me most is something that one of his guards told him, something that could stand as a fitting epitaph for Guant\xc3\xa1namo itself: \xe2\x80\x9cI know I can go to hell for what I did to you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among the many reasons for economic stagnation in the eurozone is the failure of the European Central Bank to buy government bonds to stimulate lending. A damaging lawsuit filed by a group of German citizens in 2012 made the bank even less likely to act. Last week, that legal challenge suffered a defeat when a'b' preliminary opinion 'b'from the European Court of Justice sided with the bank.'b'The opinion from the advocate general of the court, Pedro Cruz Villal\xc3\xb3n, signals that the full court will rule that the central bank has the legal authority to buy government bonds. Mr. Villal\xc3\xb3n was unstinting in declaring that the central bank has 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion\xe2\x80\x9d'b' in how it conducts monetary policy. He said that a program of bond purchases announced in 2012 but has never been used does not violate European Union treaties. The full court, which generally sides with the advocate general, is expected to rule in a few months.'b'Officials at the central bank have said that the legal challenge is not the reason that they have held back from buying bonds, at least so far. But it is clear that the lawsuit has had some effect because the central bank has stalled for months on bond purchases even as the eurozone\xe2\x80\x99s inflation rate has fallen steadily; in December, 'b'consumer prices fell'b' at an annual rate of 0.2 percent.'b'The Germans brought this lawsuit before their country\xe2\x80\x99s Federal Constitutional Court, which 'b'ruled against'b' bond purchases last year but sought the opinion of the European Court of Justice. The plaintiffs have argued that the central bank does not have the authority under European Union treaties to buy bonds issued by the 19 eurozone countries because that would amount to loaning money to those governments. But the bank\xe2\x80\x99s plan was to buy bonds held by private investors, which it argued does not amount to loaning money directly to governments.'b'While bond purchases by the central bank are not an economic miracle cure, they can play an important role, especially when benchmark interest rates are at or close to zero. It has become increasingly clear that the European Central Bank, along with European governments, has been too meek. The size of the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'balance sheet'b', which is a measure of how active it has been in supporting the economy, has been falling steadily since 2012. By contrast, the size of the Federal Reserve\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet has grown sharply, helping to support the American recovery.'b'The advocate general\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is not likely to change the views of many German leaders and citizens. The 'b'country\xe2\x80\x99s representatives'b' on the central bank\xe2\x80\x99s governing council, for example, will probably still oppose or seek to limit bond purchases. But the president of the bank, Mario Draghi, should have more than enough votes to begin bond purchases. In 2012,'b' Mr. Draghi said 'b'the bank \xe2\x80\x9cis ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s time for it to deliver on its promise.'b'The start of 2015 finds no letup in the attacks on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally protected right to make her own childbearing decisions. Republican lawmakers and organizations devoted to dismantling reproductive freedom have succeeded in shrinking the already inadequate number of abortion providers, making it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, for women \xe2\x80\x94 especially young and poor women \xe2\x80\x94 to obtain safe and legal abortion services in large swaths Texas and other parts of the country.'b'The dismal situation, created by the wave of new state abortion restrictions in Republican-led states over the past four years, would be even worse if not for the willingness of some judges to block unconstitutional laws. Defenders of abortion rights have had their hands full trying to block or at least minimize new restrictive laws, totaling 231, according to the 'b'Guttmacher Institute'b', exceeding the total for the entire previous decade.'b'Even as court battles play out in Texas and elsewhere over aggressive limitations, such as medically unnecessary hospital affiliation requirements for doctors who perform abortions and rules forcing abortion facilities to meet hospital-style building codes, legislatures in states like Missouri and Tennessee are gearing up to pile on more restrictions.'b'So is Congress, where Republicans now control both the House and Senate.'b'Already, six bills reviving old, bad ideas have been introduced in the new Congress, including one that would deny federal funds for family planning to any organization that provides abortions. Its main target is Planned Parenthood, which provides access to birth control, and breast and cervical cancer screening for millions of low-income women, and offers abortion services.'b'On Thursday, the House is expected to vote on the deceptively named Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, sponsored by Representative Trent Franks, Republican of Arizona. This measure would prohibit almost all abortions 20 weeks after fertilization, flouting the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s standard of fetal viability, generally put at 22 to 24 weeks post-fertilization.'b'It has other problems, too. It contains no exception to protect a woman\xe2\x80\x99s health, as current law mandates, or for the majority of rapes and incest crimes that go unreported. Its dangerously constricted exception for situations in which a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life is in jeopardy would require women to wait until their condition becomes life-threatening before terminating a pregnancy. And it would force women to decide whether to go forward with a pregnancy before learning of a major fetal abnormality or serious risks to their own health.'b'Criminal penalties, fines and reporting requirements would scare off doctors from helping women in need of competent and compassionate care.'b'The bill\xe2\x80\x99s supporters cite polls showing the popularity of a 20-week ban. But polls also indicate that opinions can change quickly when the real-world impact is better understood. The proposed 20-week ban on the 2013 ballot in Albuquerque was defeated by a vote of 55 percent to 45 percent. Although it would have applied just in Albuquerque, it would have affected the entire state, since the only New Mexico clinics that perform post-20-week abortions are in that city.'b'It remains to seen whether the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, will be able to muster the 60 votes needed to pass the bill in his chamber, but he has vowed to try, notwithstanding President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s past veto threat.'b'Republicans scoff at accusations that they are waging a war against women. But this should not obscure a basic fact: The ability of women to control their reproductive lives is essential for their health, careers and equality.'b'The first thing to know about the'b' lawsuit 'b'brought by two dozen states to block President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions on immigration is that it is a meritless screed wrapped in flimsy legal cloth and deposited on the doorstep of a federal district judge in Brownsville, Tex.'b'The second thing to know is that the judge, Andrew Hanen, may well look kindly on the suit. He made news in 2013 with a politically charged ruling accusing the Obama administration of criminally conspiring with Mexican drug cartels to smuggle children over the border (he 'b'really'b' said that), which is surely why the plaintiffs like their chances.'b'The judge held the first hearing in the case on Thursday and could rule as early as next month. If he blocks Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s actions \xe2\x80\x94 which seek to protect millions of immigrants from deportation and to grant them permission to work \xe2\x80\x94 this would complicate things for the administration, which is planning to start signing people up for the programs in February.'b'But there is a third thing to know: Sound legal scholars are not too worried that Judge Hanen alone will be able to kill the administration\xe2\x80\x99s programs and force the White House to abandon other reforms of enforcement policies. Even if the judge buys the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 bogus line, the government still seems likely to win on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit or the Supreme Court. The states\xe2\x80\x99 standing to sue is dubious; their claims of damage are 'b'speculative'b' at best. There is no evidence that executive action will do anything to increase illegal immigration, and there is clear data showing that giving work permits to immigrants who are already here helps, not hurts, state economies.'b'Above all, the programs rest on a rock-solid legal footing: the principle of prosecutorial discretion, under which Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s Homeland Security Department intends to use its limited resources to go after dangerous, high-priority immigration violators instead of low-priority ones. Upending that principle \xe2\x80\x94 and the Supreme Court said as recently as 2012 that \xe2\x80\x9ca principal feature of the removal system is the broad discretion exercised by immigration officials\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 could sow broad confusion over all the executive branch\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement decisions, creating what one immigration-law expert concisely'b' called 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ca royal mess.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So things will likely be O.K., but they may get bumpy in the meantime.'b'Potential applicants for deportation relief and their families need to hold firm and not let themselves be confused or bullied into not coming forward. The success of the Obama programs, one of the most positive developments on immigration reform in years, will depend on wide participation.'b'The Obama administration has an urgent job this year: setting up an ambitious, smoothly functioning effort that could grant relief to more than four million people. All the anti-immigrant side has to do is keep trying to block reform, and, failing that, to spread chaos, confusion and anxiety.'b'The country is not going to deport everybody \xe2\x80\x94 even many Republicans admit that, but they continue to refuse to do anything to fix the system. After Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s disastrous presidential pose on \xe2\x80\x9cself-deportation,\xe2\x80\x9d the party went through a stretch of sobriety and sought to enhance its damaged brand by getting in line with the public, which rejects mass deportation in favor of having immigrants come forward, pay taxes and get right with the law. But now we have Republican governors and attorneys general pressing a 25-state lawsuit, joining their counterparts in Congress who are waging a legislative assault on Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions. The party has reverted back to its original strategy: intimidation, exclusion and fear.'b'EDMONTON, Alberta \xe2\x80\x94 In December, a new prostitution law came into force in 'b'Canada'b'. The Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act, or Bill C-36, criminalizes the purchase (but not the sale) of sexual services, and restricts the advertisement of sexual services and communication in public for the purpose of prostitution. The bill replaces legislation, overturned in December 2013 by Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court, which criminalized acts associated with selling sexual services. In its 2013 ruling, the Court deemed these laws in violation of sex workers\xe2\x80\x99 rights to safety and security, and gave Prime Minister Stephen Harper\xe2\x80\x99s Conservative government one year to implement new legislation.'b'Many hoped this would be Canada\xe2\x80\x99s chance to emulate New Zealand, where the buying and selling of consensual sex between adults was decriminalized in 2003, and provisions were introduced to protect sex workers\xe2\x80\x99 health and safety. In New Zealand, valid certificates are required for prostitution businesses with more than four employees; their location and advertising may be regulated. Five-year reviews found no evidence that decriminalization had increased the size of the sex industry. Sex workers reportedly found it easier to refuse a client, felt more protected from attacks and safer to report abuse. And the health benefits are clear: A 2012 United Nations study concluded that New Zealand\xe2\x80\x99s approach increased \xe2\x80\x9caccess to H.I.V. and sexual health services and is associated with very high condom use rates.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Instead of implementing such proven policies, Bill C-36 has \xe2\x80\x94 as Justice Minister Peter MacKay, who sponsored the legislation, told the Senate Committee in September\xe2\x80\x94 effectively made prostitution \xe2\x80\x9cillegal for the first time in Canada.\xe2\x80\x9d Not only does it reproduce many of the statutes struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013, it goes further, making it a crime to purchase sexual services. Ontario\xe2\x80\x99s premier, Kathleen Wynne, has expressed \xe2\x80\x9cgrave concern,\xe2\x80\x9d and has rightly asked her province\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general to rule on its constitutionality. But the laws are here to stay, at least for a while: Alan Young, lead counsel on the 2013 case, estimates that it could take five to six years for a new challenge to reach the Supreme Court.'b'In Canada, it remains a crime to profit from the prostitution of others, or to communicate in certain public spaces for the purpose of selling sex. But Bill C-36 now makes it illegal to buy sex, and for third parties to advertise the sale of sexual services in newspapers or online. Generally, the result of laws like these is to displace street-based sex workers to remote, often unsafe areas, so clients may avoid police detection. Even those with access to private spaces will likely feel more threatened: Under Bill C-36, it is illegal to buy sex anywhere, including indoors. And the restrictions on advertising and communication limit sex workers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to screen clients or negotiate transactions. Of course, this was entirely the point. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to make life safe for prostitutes,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Donald Plett, a Conservative, told the Senate in September, \xe2\x80\x9cwe want to do away with prostitution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If abolishing prostitution is the goal for some Canadian legislators, precedent suggests that the new measure is unlikely to succeed. Bill C-36 follows the example of Sweden, Norway and Iceland, where the purchase \xe2\x80\x94 but not the sale \xe2\x80\x94 of sex was criminalized in legislation passed since the late 1990s. Proponents of this so-called Nordic model (also implemented, in various forms, in South Korea, Finland, Israel and Britain), argue that sex industries follow market principles of supply and demand, hence targeting demand will decrease supply.'b'But there is hardly a consensus on this. Advocates of the Nordic model note that criminalizing the purchase of sex reduced street prostitution in Sweden. In 2008, however, the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare reported that, though prostitution rates dropped immediately following the implementation of criminalization legislation in 1999, they rebounded by about two-thirds within a few years. A 2012 report by the Global Commission on H.I.V. and the Law found that Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csex trade remains at pre-law levels\xe2\x80\x9d; it \xe2\x80\x9csimply moved further underground,\xe2\x80\x9d or online.'b'And the Nordic model has often-damaging effects on sex workers\xe2\x80\x99 health and safety. A 2010 review published by the Swedish Institute found that criminalization resulted in heightened harassment of sex workers, who felt that they were \xe2\x80\x9chunted\xe2\x80\x9d by the police, and treated as \xe2\x80\x9cincapacitated persons\xe2\x80\x9d whose \xe2\x80\x9cwishes and choices are not respected.\xe2\x80\x9d The 2012 Global Commission report found that criminalization makes their lives \xe2\x80\x9cless safe and far riskier in terms of H.I.V.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Canada, these effects will be most deeply felt by indigenous women. Overrepresented in the country\xe2\x80\x99s street-based sex industries, they experience higher rates of stigmatization and violence, and are already inadequately protected by the police: In 2012, British Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Missing Women Commission of Inquiry cited the poor relationship between the police and sex workers, influenced by Canada\xe2\x80\x99s prostitution laws, as a factor in disappearances and murders of indigenous women. The new legislation will likely worsen the situation.'b'Bill C-36 allocates $17 million over five years \xe2\x80\x94 a relatively small amount \xe2\x80\x94 to helping sex workers leave prostitution. But this use of funds will do little to improve the lives of sex workers, and nothing for those who can\xe2\x80\x99t, or don\xe2\x80\x99t want to, quit. Rather than attempting to do away with prostitution entirely, Canada should, like New Zealand, devote its resources to ensuring that sex workers have adequate access to healthcare and other social services, and are not trafficked or otherwise exploited.'b'In Canada, the passage of Bill C-36 has sparked resistance. Vancouver has indicated its intent to prioritize municipal sex-work 'b'guidelines adopted in 2013'b', whereby enforcement is \xe2\x80\x9ca last resort.\xe2\x80\x9d NOW magazine, a Toronto weekly, 'b'has refused to comply'b' with the advertising ban; if the government counters, this could lead to the first test of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.'b'At Senate hearings in September, Kerry Porth, a former sex worker and chairwoman at the Pivot Legal Society, a Canadian advocacy group, argued that Bill C-36 would lead to \xe2\x80\x9cmore exploitation, more violence, and more desperation.\xe2\x80\x9d Sadly, instead of taking this opportunity to pass truly meaningful reforms, Canada has merely replaced one flawed policy with another.'b'Outside of America, we\xe2\x80\x99re all hypocrites when it comes to free speech.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve lived in the United States and I am a lifelong admirer of it, not least because Americans are so committed to free speech that they will defend neo-Nazis\xe2\x80\x99 right to march in public. That\xe2\x80\x99s challenging, particularly for a grandchild of Holocaust survivors like me, but free speech is the lifeblood of a vibrant democracy.'b'In my native 'b'Australia'b', though, we have no bill of rights and no explicit, constitutionally protected right to free speech. Not until the late 1990s did the High Court finally find an implied right of political communication in the Constitution.'b'That right is limited, and allows all kinds of restrictions that would be unconstitutional in the United States. In Australia, hate speech is specifically banned under 'b'section 18C of the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act'b'. This provision makes it unlawful to \xe2\x80\x9coffend, insult, humiliate or intimidate\xe2\x80\x9d a person or group on the basis of their \xe2\x80\x9crace, colour or national or ethnic origin.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Section 18C became a major political issue in 2011 when a 'b'court ruled unlawful'b' two newspaper articles by a conservative columnist named Andrew Bolt, in which he argued that light-skinned Aborigines chose to identify as Aboriginal for personal gain, dismissing their deeply held cultural identity as indigenous Australians. Mr. Bolt should have been mercilessly ridiculed for these odious views. Instead, he is regarded by many as a free speech martyr because he was prosecuted for causing offense.'b'Then, last year, the government made a push to effectively repeal 18C. But its effort was botched through a combination of overreach, misreading the public mood and lack of community consultation.'b'It looked as if 18C was here to stay.'b'The political culture surrounding free speech is fundamentally different outside America. As the judge in the Bolt case wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean and Australian approaches are based on different traditions including a greater deference to political authority.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I find that when I write for an Australian audience, I need to go back to first principles \xe2\x80\x94 to explain that there is not, and should not be, a right to not be offended; to point out that the correct response to racial slurs and Holocaust denial is ridicule, not censorship; to say that free speech means nothing if it protects only speech we find innocuous.'b'Americans need no such reminders; these are axioms, not points of contention. Australia, however, was not born in revolution, with fiery speeches and Federalist Papers about freedom and democracy.'b'Ours has been a fitful, anxious, tepid separation from England, like a fawn taking first steps, hoping for its mother\xe2\x80\x99s encouragement. England never adopted a bill of rights, so why should we? The Union Jack still defaces our flag.'b'Australia\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence rests on the idea that hate speech harms democracy by discouraging the victims of vilification from participating in public life. This is piffle. Anti-Semitism isn\xe2\x80\x99t banned in the United States, for instance, but American Jews remain fully engaged in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s political and civic life. In contrast, hate speech is 'b'banned in France'b', yet Jews there feel persecuted and embattled.'b'Such flimsy legal reasoning suffices in a country that has no constitutional protections for speech. Judges pay lip service to free speech while making a case for restricting it.'b'The fallout from the Charlie Hebdo affair may have changed that. The horrific Paris attacks and \xe2\x80\x9cJe Suis Charlie\xe2\x80\x9d campaign have exposed the hypocrisy of those in Australia who, on one hand, claim to support free speech, and, on the other, would ban Charlie Hebdo by law. Which it effectively 'b'would be'b', under 18C. What couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be done with a Kalashnikov in Paris could be handily achieved by the draconian restrictions of Australia\xe2\x80\x99s statutes.'b'This has laid bare a fundamental problem in Australia\xe2\x80\x99s polity and mobilized a new movement for reform. Australia\xe2\x80\x99s human rights commissioner, 'b'Tim Wilson'b', has support from members of Parliament to prepare the ground for change.'b'Australia should not only repeal 18C, but also enact a bill of rights that includes language like America\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment. Incitement to violence is already covered in the criminal law; all other speech should, with very limited exceptions, remain free from government restriction. If individuals\xe2\x80\x99 reputations are smeared, there is defamation law, but the causing of offense cannot be unlawful in a free society.'b'However, the reformers must learn from last year\xe2\x80\x99s errors, and make these changes gradually. Politics is the art of the possible. Many supporters of 18C, both in Labor and in minority communities, quietly agree that the current provision is overbroad. Free speech is not a partisan issue; it should transcend politics and become a bedrock principle of our democracy.'b'In the wake of Charlie Hebdo, we Australians must recognize that free speech is the right from which all others flow. We may be offended by what others say, but we ought to defend to the death their right to say it. The time has come to begin anchoring First Amendment values in Australian political culture.'b''b' 'b'Gabriel Sassoon 'b' is the foreign communications adviser to a deputy speaker of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Knesset, a political adviser to the Israeli Labor Party and a member of the Australian Labor Party.'b''b''b'Greece'b' is back as a focal point of the world financial crisis. While coming elections are spooking the markets, the supposed cause of the crisis has not changed. Greece has a declared debt of 319 billion euros, or about $369 billion, 175 percent of its 182-billion-euro ($210 billion) gross domestic product. This sounds like a nearly impossible task for any government: to govern effectively, spur economic growth and avoid default. The shackles of the declared Greek debt have effectively paralyzed the country. Yet maybe all of this debt drama is unnecessary.'b'The way this story is usually told, inside and outside Greece, is as a morality play: the profligate Greeks don\xe2\x80\x99t pay taxes and their banks and elites, in turn, rob Greek citizens and foreign investors alike. The Greeks, it seems, need to be held accountable and to pay back their debt at any cost.'b'The brutal and counterproductive response has been austerity. But given Greece\xe2\x80\x99s problems, what the country really needs is transparency and accountability. Greece has a very weak tradition of accounting, with few homebred trained accountants. The government does not use International Public Sector Accounting Standards, or Ipsas, which measure liabilities and assets over time, similar standards to those used by leading governments, businesses, banks and investors at all levels. It\xe2\x80\x99s of little surprise that without internationally verifiable accounting standards, no one feels the need to be accountable.'b'This lack of accountants not only means poor administration; it also means that the Greek government has done a lousy job of accounting for its debt number. In fact, the debt has been calculated to be larger than it actually is, or would be if one used Ipsas.'b'Without real accounting, we also can\xe2\x80\x99t evaluate the claims of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras\xe2\x80\x99s government \xe2\x80\x94 as well as those of numerous commentators \xe2\x80\x94 that Greece has made improvement in its fiscal position over the last two years. If the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank (known as the troika) are giving Greece 283 billion euros ($327 billion) of financing in return for good economic indicators \xe2\x80\x94 and credit ratings agencies like Moody\xe2\x80\x99s shake Greek and eurozone economies with pronouncements made on these numbers \xe2\x80\x94 one would think they would want to verify the numbers, using Ipsas, which would be much more transparent and something people outside the troika could realistically evaluate.'b'But the Greeks are not the only ones content with bad accounting and fishy numbers. The troika itself does not use Ipsas in calculating Greek debt, but rather what is confusingly called the Maastricht definition of debt, which is based on face value.'b'Think of face value as a promise to pay something in the so-far-distant future because its value is essentially worthless today if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get interest payments. This means that the troika calculates debt neither according to its financial worth, but rather according to a political agreement that ignores very low interest rates and the fact that money increases in value the longer you can hold and invest it. This is working to Greece\xe2\x80\x99s advantage, but Greece can\xe2\x80\x99t show it, and thus benefit from better credit ratings.'b'Neither economic principles nor international accounting standards would regard this as an acceptable way to report a debt position. Greece was so cash-strapped and used to European Union handouts that its leaders signed off on the bailout deal without international accounting standards.'b'The fact that Germany has acted as a vigilant gatekeeper over Greece\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to abide by the agreed debt and austerity measures should deserve scrutiny. Look again at the 57 billion euros ($66 billion) in German loans through the lens of accounting logic. The loans have been made at under 2 percent with maturities as far out as 2054.'b'That means that, in reality, the interest on this loan is under market rates. Giving loans well under market rates with gaping repayment schedules amounts to a grant. According to Ipsas standards on German debts, this portion of the debt alone would require only about 13 billion euros ($15 billion), leaving Germany with a considerable 44-billion-euro ($51 billion) loss.'b'But given the current draconian austerity conditions, Germany might be able to avoid showing the losses on the loan, yet it will destroy Greece in the process. Germany\xe2\x80\x99s demands for both austerity and overvaluing of the debt are both unjust and counterproductive for Greek and European stability.'b'Greek debt is not what it seems. One reason might be that the Germans have refused to price the debt fairly, or properly report its value, which means in the short run that they extract more austerity from the Greeks than they should, and that they also keep this loan off the budget balance sheets because it would come up as a loss under any legitimate accounting standard.'b'A little-known fact is that the Germans also do not use Ipsas and have notably opaque public finance standards. This means their potential loss on the Greek loan is out of sight of the German public, who, not great fans of the Greek bailout, would be even less enthusiastic if they understood the terms.'b'It should also be noted that the Greek crisis has contributed to the 15 percent drop in value of the euro over the last year, and, with this low rate, German exports have been given a huge boost.'b'By overstating Greek debt and effectively creating a false sense of crisis (the Greeks have been bailed out), the troika is undermining growth and investment through both the drama of overstated debt and by austerity measures that are ripping apart Greek society. If Greece continues with the yoke of this inaccurate debt number, it faces more recession and possibly political unrest, further destabilizing a hobbled Europe and the euro.'b'Greek leaders should demand neither more austerity nor debt default. They should simply ask that the debt be calculated using Ipsas. And while they are at it, they should implement Ipsas at home to boost confidence, investment, credit and political stability. Clear accounting would show the Greek debt to be lower, stabilize the country, and bring confidence to Greece and, correspondingly, to the euro.'b'LAGOS, Nigeria \xe2\x80\x94 Here in 'b'Nigeria'b'\xe2\x80\x99s commercial hub, it is tempting to regard Boko Haram, the Islamist terrorist group that for more than five years has waged war in the country\xe2\x80\x99s far northeast, as a distant tragedy. We are, of course, aware of the fallout: the thousands of deaths, the hundreds of thousands of displaced persons, the destroyed infrastructure \xe2\x80\x94 schools, churches, mosques, homes, police stations \xe2\x80\x94 that will take years, and millions of dollars, to rebuild. But in southern Nigeria, it is easy to feel removed from the crisis.'b'The reality, though, is that the insurgency\xe2\x80\x99s impact ripples out across the country. A visit last year to a popular fabric market in Abeokuta, a city about 60 miles north of Lagos, brought this home to me.'b'I was there to interview the merchants about their work. When we talked about the challenges they faced, I expected the usual: electricity, taxation, access to credit. So I was surprised when one woman mentioned Boko Haram. A number of her customers lived in northern Nigeria and had stopped placing orders since the insurgency began.'b'The trade links between north and south are even more apparent in agriculture. Much of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s food comes from the troubled region. Potiskum, a city that the jihadist militants have attacked on several occasions in recent years, killing dozens, is one of the largest cattle markets in West Africa. Chibok, the village from which hundreds of girls were abducted last April, is a village of farmers, growing grain that goes to market across the country.'b'I spoke with the father of one of the missing girls last year, a few months after the abductions. Like many farmers in the area, he was too scared to go out in the fields to plant anything, and the season was almost over. Not only would he be unable to feed his remaining family, but there would also be nothing to sell.'b'For Nigerians, the economy is an ever-present concern: The country often seems at the mercy of cyclical oil prices, currency devaluations and budget deficits. But Boko Haram\xe2\x80\x99s campaign of terror has emerged as the single most important issue facing Nigeria.'b'What is unfamiliar and hard to adjust to is the sort of threat to the nation that Boko Haram represents. Nigeria is no stranger to instability: Our history is rife with communal clashes and civil unrest, with casualty figures unimaginable in America. In the late 1960s, the country was torn apart by a civil war over the secession of the Biafra region that resulted in the deaths of more than a million people.'b'But no crisis in recent history has matched that created by the insurgency in the north. The cumulative death toll now exceeds 11,000. Boko Haram\xe2\x80\x99s stated aim is to create an Islamic caliphate, but it shows little impulse toward establishing its legitimacy as an alternative government. The reports of a massacre this month in Baga, and satellite images of wholesale destruction in nearby Doro Gowon, affirm the fact that Nigeria is facing an army of psychopaths masquerading as Islamic proselytizers \xe2\x80\x94 and the only reasonable response should be military force.'b'Instead, the government keeps stumbling from one disaster to another, leaving most of us mystified about why the insurgency has been so horribly mishandled. After the Chibok girls were kidnapped, it took President 'b'Goodluck Jonathan'b' three weeks to address the nation, and months went by before he met with their families.'b'The international community, too, has grown impatient. The United States government has refused to sell arms to Nigeria, not trusting either the competence or human rights record of the military. When a Nigerian plane, laden with $9.3 million in cash, was detained in South Africa last September, the government was forced to admit that it was trying to purchase weapons on the black market. Soon after, a triumphant declaration of a cease-fire with Boko Haram turned out to be a hoax; senior government officials had been hoodwinked.'b'The fiascos continue. The Baga massacre was greeted with silence from the president, while the military played down the number of casualties. Instead, Mr. Jonathan condemned the terrorist attacks in Paris, and we were treated to media photos of the wedding of the president\xe2\x80\x99s niece, which took place on the weekend the news about Baga broke.'b'With about a month to go until the general election, such missteps have come to define Mr. Jonathan\xe2\x80\x99s government. The opposition has accused him of corruption, pointing to the country\xe2\x80\x99s ballooning (but seemingly ineffective) security budget.'b'At an election rally in southwestern Nigeria earlier this month, I heard an opposition politician tell the crowd that the only way to ensure the safety of their children was to vote for Muhammadu Buhari. General Buhari, a 72-year-old retired army officer who ruled Nigeria 30 years ago, is the best placed to win of the candidates challenging Mr. Jonathan.'b'His All Progressives Congress party promotes an ambitious program to create jobs, tackle corruption, provide free education and health care, and invest in infrastructure, but its plans have been short on detail. Yet, for many, the desire for change is stronger than the doubts about a civilian Buhari presidency.'b'In his campaigning, Mr. Jonathan vigorously rebuts the idea that he has underperformed or is too tolerant of corruption. But he has mostly avoided mentioning Boko Haram. Perhaps he has realized that by now his cache of platitudes \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cTerrorism is a global problem,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNigeria is not alone in dealing with it,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNigeria will triumph\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 sound hollow in a stump speech.'b'Nigerians need to take the decisive action that their president has failed to offer. My hope is that on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, when the election takes place, Nigerians will remember the missing girls of Chibok, and the dead residents of Baga and the refugees of the north, and vote out a man who has demonstrated, beyond doubt, that he cannot inspire confidence as a commander in chief.'b''b' 'b'Tolu Ogunlesi 'b' is a journalist, poet and photographer, and the author of, most recently, the novella \xe2\x80\x9cConquest and Conviviality.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'With campus sexual assault a major topic of national concern and conversation, universities are experimenting with ways to reduce sexual violence. One popular strategy is to crack down on fraternities. The University of Virginia, for instance, suspended frat activities after the publication of the 'b'now-discredited'b' Rolling Stone story on the gang rape of a freshman; then it 'b'announced'b' new 'b'safety measures'b', including a rule stipulating that at least three \xe2\x80\x9csober and lucid\xe2\x80\x9d frat members monitor parties. Clemson, Emory and Johns Hopkins, among others, 'b'have also'b' moved to curtail Greek mayhem.'b'The decision to strike at frats makes sense: They\xe2\x80\x99re hubs for binge drinking and hooking up, sometimes consensual and sometimes not. But instead of only regulating fraternities, administrators might want to consider a more free-market approach to changing the campus party scene. Specifically, they could rattle the virtual monopoly that frats often have on large parties by encouraging other, possibly more responsible groups to throw parties that are less dangerous for women.'b'Who could compete with fraternities and bring more party choice to universities? Sororities.'b'As The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Alan Schwarz explained 'b'on Monday'b', most national Greek-letter sororities do not throw keggers. They are, in fact, barred from serving alcohol at their residences. Julie Johnson, an officer at the National Panhellenic Conference, said in an interview that the point of the ban was to \xe2\x80\x9censure safety\xe2\x80\x9d as well as compliance with drinking-age laws. She also said she did not foresee the rule \xe2\x80\x9cchanging anywhere in the near future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like many policies aimed at stamping out bad behavior by banning it, however, the alcohol prohibition doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually appear to be keeping sorority women safe. For one thing, women in sororities are more likely than their non-Greek counterparts to report having problems with alcohol, according to a 'b'2007 study'b'.'b'The ban also gives frats undue control over the party scene. It\xe2\x80\x99s frat members who get to mix the drinks, establish the \xe2\x80\x9cambience\xe2\x80\x9d (sticky floors, dim lights, music loud enough to mask arguments or even cries of protest) and determine the guest list. If a frat member wants to bring a girl back to his bed, all he has to do is get her upstairs \xe2\x80\x94 not across campus in full view of other students, who could theoretically intervene if they saw anything suspicious. Yet undergraduate women keep attending frat parties because, as one freshman told Mr. Schwarz, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what we know.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Imagine if sororities offered undergraduates a nighttime alternative to frat parties. They probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw cake-and-tea affairs, or anything remotely P.G., but it stands to reason that female hosts would prevent the worst excesses \xe2\x80\x94 like 'b'punch spiked'b' with 'b'date-rape drugs'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that can lead to violence. And perhaps they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let a classmate lead another, drunker classmate upstairs to a locked room.'b'Telling fraternities not to throw parties is overbearing; telling undergraduates not to attend frat parties won\xe2\x80\x99t work; and telling undergraduates to control their drinking at frat parties probably won\xe2\x80\x99t work, either.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a movement on campuses to 'b'lower the national drinking age'b' as a counterintuitive way to reduce binge drinking. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether that would work. But, in that spirit, universities could try to reduce the problems associated with binge drinking by encouraging sororities to assume the role of social counterweight to fraternities.'b' 'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'While a Jan. 12 'b'editorial'b' rightly underscores Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to European energy security and promoting intercultural dialogue, it shows little appreciation for the changing realities in Eurasia.'b'Should America\xe2\x80\x99s partners relate to Washington based on what they learn about the United States from WikiLeaks, a source that you quote, or through the prism of individual cases, where the American view of justice differs from perceptions abroad?

Her primary concern is that some seniors, particularly those with other existing conditions and limited life expectancy, are being encouraged to achieve low blood glucose levels that increase their risk for hypoglycemia.'b'The American Diabetes Association agrees with her concerns, and since 2012 we have recommended that blood glucose targets be 'b'individualized for all diabetes patients'b', including 'b'seniors'b'. Recently, agents with decreased risk of hypoglycemia have become available, providing new options in therapy for people at high risk of morbidity because of hypoglycemia. But while goals should be individualized, having goals is very important.'b'Several major, definitive clinical trials have shown that aggressive blood glucose control reduces the risk for life-impairing and life-threatening microvascular complications, including blindness, kidney disease and amputation.'b'We cannot afford simply to say that once a person reaches 65, glycemic goals and treatment methods can be casually loosened to avoid any chance of hypoglycemia.

If we take the right steps \xe2\x80\x94 including more aggressive recruitment and rewarding of exemplary teachers and the continued implementation of higher standards \xe2\x80\x94 we can help kids at every rung of the economic ladder.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll of these need to be backed by funding,\xe2\x80\x9d Schnur, who has advised the Obama administration on education, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are great examples of what works, such as quality preschool and early learning for low-income children.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the State of the Union both last year and the year before it, President Obama called for universal preschool (to no avail). Some studies have shown that disadvantaged children start falling behind even before that point.'b'The moral is this: Education is a continuous concern and must be a continuous investment, cradle to Ivory Tower. If we don\xe2\x80\x99t recognize and act on that, our reality will never meet our expectations.'b'AS much as we love our digital devices, many of us have an uneasy sense that they are destroying our attention spans. We skitter from app to app, seldom alighting for long. Our ability to concentrate is shot, right?'b'Research shows that our intuition is wrong. We can focus. But our sense that we can\xe2\x80\x99t may not be a phantom. Paying attention requires not just ability but desire. Technology may snuff out our desire to focus.'b'The idea that gadgets corrode our attention span sounds logical. Screen-based activities can take 'b'upward of 11 hours'b' of a teenager\xe2\x80\x99s day, and many demand rapid shifts of attention: quick camera cuts in videos, frenetically paced games, answering questions in multiple apps, not to mention web design that invites skimming. And we often do all this simultaneously, so attention bounces between two (or three or eight) fast-paced tasks. The theory is that the brain\xe2\x80\x99s plasticity turns this quick mental pivoting into a habit, rendering us unable to sustain attention.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s little evidence that attention spans are shrinking. Scientists use \xe2\x80\x9cspan\xe2\x80\x9d to mean two separate things: how much we can keep in mind, and how well we can maintain focus. They measure the former by asking people to repeat increasingly long strings of digits in reverse order. They measure the latter by asking people to monitor visual stimuli for occasional, subtle changes. Performance on these tests today looks a whole lot as it did 50 years ago.'b'Scientists also note that although mental tasks can change our brains, the impact is usually modest. For example, 'b'practice with action video games'b' improves some aspects of vision, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a small boost, not an overhaul of how we see. Attention is so central to our ability to think that a significant deterioration would require a retrofitting of other cognitive functions. Mental reorganization at that scale happens over evolutionary time, not because you got a smartphone.'b'But if our attention span is not shrinking, why do we feel it is? Why, in a 'b'2012 Pew survey'b', did nearly 90 percent of teachers claim that students can\xe2\x80\x99t pay attention the way they could a few years ago? It may be that digital devices have not left us unable to pay attention, but have made us unwilling to do so.'b'The digital world carries the promise of amusement that is constant, immediate and limitless. If a YouTube video isn\xe2\x80\x99t funny in the first 10 seconds, why watch when I can instantly seek something better on BuzzFeed or Spotify? The Internet hasn\xe2\x80\x99t shortened my attention span, but it has fixed a persistent thought in the back of my mind: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t there something better to do than what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing?'b'Are we more easily bored than we were 20 years ago? Researchers don\xe2\x80\x99t know, but recent studies support the suggestion that our antennas are always up. People\xe2\x80\x99s performance on basic 'b'laboratory tests of attention'b' gets worse if a cellphone is merely visible nearby. In 'b'another experiment'b', people using a driving simulator were more likely to hit a pedestrian when their cellphone rang, even if they had planned in advance not to answer it.'b'The direst prediction offered by digital critics \xe2\x80\x94 our phones are really pocket-size deep fryers for the mind \xe2\x80\x94 may be untrue, but the alternative I\xe2\x80\x99ve suggested sounds nearly as bad. The appetite for endless entertainment suggests that worthier activities will be shoved aside. We may buy Salman Rushdie\xe2\x80\x99s book, but we\xe2\x80\x99ll end up sucked in by Flappy Bird.'b'That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t quite seem to be the case, either. Research shows, for example, that the amount of leisure reading hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed with the advent of the digital age. Before we congratulate ourselves, though, let\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledge that brainier hobbies have never been that popular. There have always been ways to kill time.'b'Still, digital activities may be different. Over the last decade, neuroscientists 'b'distinguished two systems of attention'b' and associated thought. One is directed outward, as when you scroll through your email or play Candy Crush. The other is directed inward, as when you daydream, plan what you\xe2\x80\x99ll do tomorrow, or reflect on the past. Clearly, most digital activities call for outwardly directed attention. These two modes of attention work like a toggle switch; when one is on, the other is off. In fact, when attention is outwardly directed, the inwardly directed attention system is somewhat suppressed. Given the amount of time people spend with digital devices, that sounds ominous.'b'Will we actually lose our ability to daydream? Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope not. Among daydreaming\xe2\x80\x99s many merits, 'b'research shows'b', is an association with greater creativity. But there is a dark side of inwardly directed thought, too. Daydreaming often distracts us when we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get something done. And reflection can turn ugly, as when we ruminate about some past insult or error.'b'Digital devices are not eating away at our brains. They are, however, luring us toward near constant outwardly directed thought, a situation that\xe2\x80\x99s probably unique in human experience. A flat cap on time with devices \xe2\x80\x94 the restriction we first think of for ourselves and our kids \xe2\x80\x94 might help. So would parking devices in another room for a while. But it would be more effective if we could learn to recognize in ourselves when escape from our thoughts is O.K. and when reflection is in order. As a bonus, judgments like that require inwardly directed attention, a mental habit that in our smartphone era, we\xe2\x80\x99d be dumb to lose.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been a fan of global conferences to solve problems, but when I read that 'b'the Obama administration is organizing'b' a Summit on Countering Violent Extremism for Feb. 18, in response to the Paris killings, I had a visceral reaction: Is there a box on my tax returns that I can check so my tax dollars won\xe2\x80\x99t go to pay for this?'b'When you don\xe2\x80\x99t call things by their real name, you always get in trouble. And this administration, so fearful of being accused of Islamophobia, is refusing to make any link to radical Islam from the recent explosions of violence against civilians (most of them Muslims) by Boko Haram in Nigeria, by the Taliban in Pakistan, by Al Qaeda in Paris and by jihadists in Yemen and Iraq. We\xe2\x80\x99ve entered the theater of the absurd.'b'Last week the conservative columnist 'b'Rich Lowry wrote an essay'b' in Politico Magazine that contained quotes from White House spokesman Josh Earnest that I could not believe. I was sure they were made up. But I checked the transcript: 100 percent correct. I can\xe2\x80\x99t say it better than Lowry did:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe administration has lapsed into unselfconscious ridiculousness. Asked why the administration won\xe2\x80\x99t say [after the Paris attacks] we are at war with radical Islam, Earnest on Tuesday explained the administration\xe2\x80\x99s first concern \xe2\x80\x98is accuracy. We want to describe exactly what happened. These are individuals who carried out an act of terrorism, and they later tried to justify that act of terrorism by invoking the religion of Islam and their own deviant view of it.\xe2\x80\x99'b'This makes it sound as if the Charlie Hebdo terrorists set out to commit a random act of violent extremism and only subsequently, when they realized that they needed some justification, did they reach for Islam.'b'The day before, Earnest had conceded that there are lists of recent \xe2\x80\x98examples of individuals who have cited Islam as they\xe2\x80\x99ve carried out acts of violence.\xe2\x80\x99 Cited Islam? According to the Earnest theory ... purposeless violent extremists rummage through the scriptures of great faiths, looking for some verses to cite to support their mayhem and often happen to settle on the holy texts of Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama knows better. I am all for restraint on the issue, and would never hold every Muslim accountable for the acts of a few. But it is not good for us or the Muslim world to pretend that this spreading jihadist violence isn\xe2\x80\x99t coming out of their faith community. It is coming mostly, but not exclusively, from angry young men and preachers on the fringe of the Sunni Arab and Pakistani communities in the Middle East and Europe.'b'If Western interventions help foster violent Islamic reactions, we should reduce them. To the extent that Muslim immigrants in European countries feel marginalized, they and their hosts should worker harder on absorption. But both efforts will only take you so far.'b'Something else is also at work, and it needs to be discussed. It is the struggle within Arab and Pakistani Sunni Islam over whether and how to embrace modernity, pluralism and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. That struggle drives, and is driven by, the dysfunctionality of so many Arab states and Pakistan. It has left these societies with too many young men who have never held a job or a girl\xe2\x80\x99s hand, who then seek to overcome their humiliation at being left behind, and to find identity, by \xe2\x80\x9cpurifying\xe2\x80\x9d their worlds of other Muslims who are not sufficiently pious and of Westerners whom they perceive to be putting Muslims down. But you don\xe2\x80\x99t see this in the two giant Muslim communities in Indonesia or India.'b'\xc2\xa0Only Sunni Arabs and Pakistanis can get inside their narrative and remediate it.

The new agenda stands apart from Lyndon Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s War on Poverty, which was focused primarily on the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Other America'b'\xe2\x80\x9d of the very poor.'b'The most damaging contemporary American trend that the proposals seek to counter is the sharply declining share of national income flowing to labor, and the parallel increase in the share flowing to owners of capital. This trend, which accelerated sharply in 2000, is shown in 'b'Figure 1'b', a graphic produced by the White House.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe need to share the wealth,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Charles E.

The money would be used to finance tax cuts and credits for low-to-moderate-income men and women, and to make attendance at community colleges tuition-free.'b'Not only would Obama raise 'b'capital gains tax'b' rates from 23.8 to 28 percent for couples making more than $500,000 in taxable income, but he would eliminate a provision in tax law that allows the very rich to avoid taxation on much of the wealth passed on to their children and he would end a current exemption from taxation on the increase in the value of stocks, bonds and other assets when passed on through inheritance.'b'This exemption, technically called the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'stepped up basis'b',\xe2\x80\x9d is crucial to the unrestricted intergenerational transfer of wealth, a practice that 'b'many liberals'b', and even some conservatives, contend conflicts with equality of opportunity. The Obama plan additionally calls for 'b'a .07 percent fee'b' on financial institutions with more than $50 billion in assets that would produce $110 billion in revenue over 10 years.'b'Van Hollen, in turn, would raise revenues by imposing a transaction tax on stock trades. He would use the money to finance a $1,000 tax credit for workers making less than $100,000 annually, a $20,000 deduction for two-earner families, an annual $250 payment to those who put at least $500 into an approved retirement pension plan, and to substantially increase child care tax credits.'b'Van Hollen would also bar large corporations from deducting C.E.O. and other corporate compensation over $1 million unless employees got pay raises reflecting increases in worker productivity and the cost of living.'b'The Summers-Balls report includes many of the proposals outlined by Obama and Van Hollen. Balls 'b'warned on his blog'b' that \xe2\x80\x9cunfettered markets and trickle-down economics are leading to increasing levels of inequality, stagnating wages and a hollowing out of decent, middle income jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Their report addresses four major economic developments broadly undermining wages and working conditions:'b'First, that \xe2\x80\x9cincreasing global economic integration has also meant increased competition for many workers who produce tradable goods and services.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Second, that \xe2\x80\x9cadvances in robotics and artificial intelligence have put intermediate-skill jobs at risk in what economists call a hollowing out of the labor market.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Third, that \xe2\x80\x9cMajor corporations have opted to use subcontracting to perform basic functions, and many workers are now classified as independent contractors, eroding basic labor law protections.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And fourth, \xe2\x80\x9ccorporations have come to function much less effectively as providers of large-scale opportunity. Increasingly, their dominant focus has been on maximization of share prices and the compensation of their top employees.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In addition, Summers and Balls argue that competition in the banking sector has broken down and \xe2\x80\x9cwill need interventions to support the reasonable functioning of the free market.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What do these points actually signify in practice? In a section titled \xe2\x80\x9cU.S. Policy Response,\xe2\x80\x9d Summers and Balls call for making parent companies responsible for the working conditions of employees of subcontractors; adopting government policies favoring employee stock ownership so that workers benefit from the growing share of national income flowing to capital as opposed to wages; and imposing tough and costly sanctions on employers who use illegal tactics to fight unionization.'b'Not stopping there, Summers and Balls call for a substantial boost in the $24,000 pay ceiling under which employees must get time and a half for overtime work beyond 40 hours a week; increased infrastructure spending of $100 billion a year, or $1 trillion over 10 years; and strengthened provisions in trade agreements guaranteeing collective bargaining rights and basic environmental protections to reduce the movement of American companies to countries with the lowest labor standards.'b'Among their other proposed policy initiatives are creation of an income tax credit for those with moderate pay levels. It would start at $23,260 for joint filers with children, just where the current earned-income tax credit phases out. At $85,000, the credit would diminish, reaching zero at $95,000. They would also change the mortgage interest and property tax deductions into tax credits. Deductions inherently provide larger benefits to those in higher tax brackets. Credits provide equal benefits to all who qualify.'b'Republican leaders in Congress have 'b'already stiff-armed'b' these proposals.'b'In response to Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plan to tax the wealthy to boost breaks for the working class, Michael Steed, spokesman for the speaker of the House, John A. Boehner, said in a statement, \xe2\x80\x9cMore Washington tax hikes and spending is the same old top-down approach we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to expect from President Obama that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe president needs to stop listening to his liberal allies who want to raise taxes at all costs and start working with Congress to fix our broken tax code,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement,'b'Taken together, the Obama, Van Hollen, and Summers interpretations of \xe2\x80\x9cinclusive capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d are a victory for the left of the Democratic Party. This is especially the case for the 'b'Economic Policy Institute'b', which has been conducting a lonely fight for stronger legislative and regulatory initiatives to counter stagnating wages.'b'Josh Bivens, the research director at E.P.I., said in an email that the proposals did indeed \xe2\x80\x9clook like a shift in the Democratic Party on economic policy.\xe2\x80\x9d He said his hope was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe next two years becomes a competition about who is willing to be the most aggressive in trying to boost low/middle-class incomes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dean Baker, co-director of the 'b'Center for Economic and Policy Research'b', called the Obama plan \xe2\x80\x9ca pretty big deal. Raising the capital gains tax rate and ending the stepped-up basis at death are changes that almost exclusively hit the wealthy, and they amount to a fair bit of money.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While none of the proposals, or their advocates, acknowledge this explicitly, one of the objectives of the evolving Democratic economic agenda is to get back support among whites without college degrees \xe2\x80\x93 the polling shorthand version of what is sometimes still called the white working class.'b'In 2014, these voters, who made up 36 percent of the electorate, 'b'cast their ballots'b' for Republican House candidates by a 30-point margin (64-34 percent). This was nearly double the 16-point Republican margin among white college graduates, 57-41.'b'Inclusive capitalism has its critics on the left, nicely summed up by the Guardian columnist 'b'Nafeez Ahmed'b'. He argued last May that the inclusive capitalism movement represented \xe2\x80\x9cless a meaningful shift of direction than a barely transparent effort to rehabilitate a parasitical economic system on the brink of facing a global uprising.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Andrew Grove, founder of Intel, put the push toward \xe2\x80\x9cinclusive capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d in a more positive light. \xe2\x80\x9cOur generation has seen the decisive victory of free-market principles over planned economies,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he told the Economist'b' in 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cSo we stick with this belief largely oblivious to emerging evidence that while free markets beat planned economies, there may be room for a modification that is even better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While the new agenda has no chance of passage in the Republican-controlled Congress, Democrats plan to use the tenets of inclusive capitalism in the 2016 elections. One Democratic goal in putting specific policies forward is to use them as wedge issues to force Republicans to choose between their affluent backers and their supporters in the white working class. This will be no easy task because a decisive majority of whites without college degrees has been voting against Democratic candidates for two decades, making it very difficult for the party to break what has been a Republican hammerlock since 1994.'b'The circumstances facing President Obama as 'b'he delivered his State of the Union address Tuesday night'b' could not have seemed less promising: a presidency with only two years left to get anything done in a Congress that is now totally in the control of a party that has routinely ignored his pleas for cooperation. So he chose wisely to send a simple, dramatic message about economic fairness, about the fact that the well-off \xe2\x80\x94 the top earners, the big banks, Silicon Valley \xe2\x80\x94 have done just great, while the middle and working classes remain dead in the water. His remedy: skim from the rich and redistribute to those below, while deploying other weapons to raise wages and increase jobs.'b'He did not frame the debate over inequality as starkly as many economists have, preferring instead to talk about the virtues of \xe2\x80\x9cmiddle-class economics.\xe2\x80\x9d But he came close. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years, and for decades to come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well? Or will we commit ourselves to an economy that generates rising incomes and chances for everyone who makes the effort?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Obama knows his prospects of getting Congress to agree are less than zero; Republicans dismissed his ideas before he even voiced them. That does not make them irrelevant. Mr. Obama was speaking not just to the present but to the future, to the 2016 presidential elections and even beyond. By simply raising the plight of the middle class (and, looming behind it, the larger issue of economic inequality), he has firmly inserted issues of economic fairness into the political debate. Hillary Rodham Clinton or whomever the Democrats nominate cannot ignore them now. Even Republicans, disinclined to raise taxes on top-tier earners, may find attractive the idea of doing something for those in the middle.'b'Further, while the rhetoric was combative, even defiant in parts, the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposal is hardly radical. It would raise the capital gains tax to 28 percent \xe2\x80\x94 which is where it was in the Reagan era. It would impose ordinary income tax rates on dividends and end a provision in the tax code that shields hundreds of billions of dollars in appreciated wealth passed on to heirs. These changes, plus a new fee on big banks, would finance a set of tax breaks for middle-income families, including credits for two-earner couples, increased child care and college tuition credits, as well as other programs, including two years of tuition-free community college for some students. And the whole thing is designed to be revenue-neutral, the tax increases paying for the new programs to avoid the endless wrangling over deficits that have exhausted both political parties as well as the American public.'b'It was hardly surprising that a president who expects so little from Congress devoted some of his speech to celebrating the things that he has accomplished against considerable odds. With Congress\xe2\x80\x99s help, he rescued the automobile companies, jump-started the renewable energy industry, imposed new rules on financial institutions and, most dramatically, engineered a major overhaul of the health care system. On his own initiative, he ordered major reforms in immigration policy, forged a landmark agreement with the automobile companies on fuel efficiency and proposed tough restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.'b'His task will be to defend these initiatives from almost certain congressional attack, wielding his veto pen, or threatening to wield it, much as President Bill Clinton found himself doing after Newt Gingrich and his Republican majority took over the House in 1995. President Obama should also seek out opportunities to use his executive authority to improve conditions for the middle class and for workers, such as fixing overtime rules, and, at every opportunity, use the bully pulpit on important matters like improving the minimum wage.'b'There is one other thing he must do: Resist his instinct to follow the false promise of compromise. Give-and-take is part of the legislative process, but trade-offs amounting to Republican legislative triumphs are unacceptable. Gridlock seems almost foreordained over the next two years. Mr. Obama should do nothing to confuse the voters as to where the responsibility lies.'b'AT some point in the next few weeks, the Democratic National Committee will announce the location of its 2016 convention. Philadelphia and Columbus are in the running, but for many, the money is on Brooklyn. And the site does seem attractive: The convention would take place at the Barclays Center, a state-of-the-art arena in the hippest borough of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s media capital.'b'But setting aside the wisdom of hosting a Democratic convention in the bluest spot east of Berkeley, the committee should look elsewhere. Brooklyn and Barclays are a logistical and ethical minefield.'b'First, logistics. Despite an estimated 2,000 hotel rooms in Downtown Brooklyn, most of the expected 35,000 visitors will sleep in Manhattan. Though the arena is quite accessible by subway, the city has proposed moving thousands of delegates along temporary dedicated bus lanes across the bridges and through Downtown Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x94 a potential traffic mess along an already congested corridor.'b'More important, the Barclays Center\xe2\x80\x99s neighborhood setting \xe2\x80\x94 a busy commercial center shoehorned into a dense residential zone \xe2\x80\x94 means there will be little parking available and little margin of error for vehicles serving the arena and the trucks going to its loading docks.'b'Backers profess no worries; after all, they say, critics of the arena raised similar concerns after 2003 when its developer, Forest City Ratner, announced that the Nets basketball team would move there from New Jersey, and traffic has been manageable. But arena events still vex the nearest neighbors, especially when limousines and other private vehicles lurk on residential blocks, since there\xe2\x80\x99s little streetside parking and few places to legally idle.'b'The convention would ripple farther than boosters admit. A political conclave, in this security-conscious era, entails a much more robust police presence, with the potential for street and even sidewalk closures in the surrounding blocks (Mayor Bill de Blasio did not acknowledge that nearby businesses might have to close for the convention until that uncomfortable possibility was raised in Politico). And, of course, space must be found for the armies of reporters, film crews and protesters who would inevitably follow.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the arena itself. Do the members of the Democratic National Committee realize that the convention would be in a major construction zone? While the Barclays Center interior is finished (though workers are retrofitting a green roof), its neighboring sites in the Atlantic Yards megaproject, a forest of residential skyscrapers now called Pacific Park Brooklyn, have only just gotten started. Two of those towers that abut the arena will be under construction in summer 2016, bracketing an entire flank of the arena with cranes and construction equipment.'b'The arena also raises ethically sticky questions for the Democrats. While the Barclays Center is owned primarily by Forest City Ratner, 45 percent of it is owned by the Russian billionaire Mikhail D. Prokhorov (who also owns 80 percent of the Brooklyn Nets). Mr. Prokhorov has a necessarily cordial relationship with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s president, Vladimir V. Putin \xe2\x80\x94 though he has been critical of Mr. Putin in the past, last year, at the Russian president\xe2\x80\x99s request, he tried to transfer ownership of the Nets to one of his Moscow-based companies. An oligarch-owned arena is an odd place to host one of American democracy\xe2\x80\x99s premier events.'b'The dubious optics extend to Forest City Ratner\xe2\x80\x99s other partner, the Greenland Holding Group, a Chinese conglomerate that owns most of the planned 16-tower project tethered to the arena. Owned by the government of Shanghai, Greenland now reaps the benefit of the subsidies, tax breaks and cheap land that Forest City Ratner wangled for the project in the 2000s.'b'Perhaps the diciest symbolism regards Greenland and Forest City Ratner\xe2\x80\x99s extensive use of a federal program called EB-5, which allows foreign investors to get visas in exchange for a short-term $500,000 investment (an amount that, on paper, is purported to create 10 jobs).'b'Greenland and Forest City Ratner have already reportedly raised some $250 million through the program; put differently, a Chinese government is making a profit by marketing American residency to its own nationals \xe2\x80\x94 a bizarre, if legal, twist on the law\xe2\x80\x99s intent.'b'Forest City Ratner has long defended the project by citing its promise to include 2,250 \xe2\x80\x9caffordable housing\xe2\x80\x9d units (out of 6,430 total). It\xe2\x80\x99s a promise that the mayor is happy to repeat: At the Dec. 15 groundbreaking for a tower on the eastern end of the site, Mr. de Blasio cited a \xe2\x80\x9c100 percent affordable\xe2\x80\x9d tower as \xe2\x80\x9ca symbol of what we intend to do with our affordable housing plan over and over.\xe2\x80\x9d But affordable housing is a vague term, and in this case, half of those units will go to households earning six figures. While most New Yorkers could use help with housing costs, this departs from Forest City\xe2\x80\x99s promise to help more working-class residents.'b'While Mr. de Blasio tries to sell Barclays Center and Atlantic Yards as an icon of a hip, prospering city, in reality Brooklyn continues to struggle with yawning socioeconomic challenges, including a 35 percent child poverty rate. And while that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a reason not to boost one\xe2\x80\x99s own city, Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s challenge today is not boosting its profile but dealing with the attractiveness of its already enormous global cachet. The last decade has seen a cascade of Manhattan and global wealth pouring into the borough, buying up huge chunks of working-class neighborhoods and converting them into fields of luxury condos. This is gentrification on steroids, an enormous challenge that the mayor can barely dent.'b'The Barclays Center/Atlantic Yards megaproject, which relied on a dubious finding of blight to deliver a gentrifying district to a developer via eminent domain, was even touted as a response to gentrification, but has hardly proven so.'b'Brooklyn and Barclays are fine places to visit. But they are the last place that a political party intent on building a base among the struggling American middle class should choose for its quadrennial close-up.'b'Some Argentines are calling Alberto Nisman, the maverick prosecutor, the 86th casualty of one of the deadliest, unsolved terrorists attacks in modern history: the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires. That seems fitting whether 'b'his death over the weekend'b' turns out to be a suicide, as the government of 'b'President Cristina Fern\xc3\xa1ndez de Kirchner'b' seems eager to establish, or the murder of a man who had learned too much.'b'This much is clear: The best hope of definitively establishing the truth about the horrific 'b'July 18, 1994, bombing'b' and its tortured, politicized investigation is to impanel an international team of jurists who can take a fresh, objective look at the evidence.'b'The truth became more important after Mr. Nisman\xe2\x80\x99s body was discovered inside his apartment on Sunday, hours before he was expected to testify on his startling allegation that Ms. Kirchner cut a deal with the Iranian government to protect some of the culprits of the attack.'b'Ms. Kirchner\xe2\x80\x99s late husband, former president N\xc3\xa9stor Kirchner, appointed Mr. Nisman to lead the inquiry a decade ago after acknowledging a shocking series of blunders by those assigned to the case over the years. Mr. Nisman, 51, became convinced that the bombing was carried out by the Shiite militant movement Hezbollah under orders of the Iranian government. Based on the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s investigation, Argentina got Interpol to issue arrest notices for 'b'seven prominent Iranians'b', including a Hezbollah leader and several government officials.'b'In a strange twist, in January 2013, Argentina announced it had reached a deal with Iran to establish a \xe2\x80\x9ctruth commission\xe2\x80\x9d that would investigate the case jointly. The notion that Iran could be counted on to play a constructive role was questionable at best and rightly met with skepticism from Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s Jewish community.'b'Earlier this month, Mr. Nisman unveiled a 'b'300-page complaint charging'b' that Ms. Kirchner and Foreign Minister H\xc3\xa9ctor Timerman conspired to absolve top Iranian officials in exchange for commercial deals that would benefit both cash-strapped governments. President Kirchner issued stern denials. Mr. Nisman said he would corroborate the allegations in a congressional hearing on Monday.'b'According to the Argentine press, there were no signs that Mr. Nisman was suicidal in recent days. Over the weekend, he prepared for the hearing. He wrote a grocery list for his maid to run to the store on Monday. Despite having a 10-person security detail, Mr. Nisman signaled that he was concerned for his safety, telling an Argentine journalist, Natasha Niebieskikwiat, on Saturday: 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI might turn up dead from all this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Ms. Kirchner, a pugnacious stateswoman who has been vindictive toward enemies in the press and politics, weighed in on the case in 'b'a lengthy, rambling statement'b' posted on her personal website late Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cSuicide,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote, is always a befuddling act. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat led a person to make such a terrible decision and end their life?\xe2\x80\x9d Missing from her note was a message of condolence for Mr. Nisman\xe2\x80\x99s family. But the most glaring omission is the fact that the manner of death is far from a settled question.'b'SEOUL, South Korea \xe2\x80\x94  While 'b'North Korea'b' draws world attention with spectacular and seemingly bizarre actions like the hacking of Sony\xe2\x80\x99s computers or outbursts of bellicose rhetoric, Pyongyang has quietly initiated a round of reforms aimed at liberalizing the economy.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that 'b'Kim Jong-un'b', the young North Korean leader who inherited power in December 2011, will allow economic liberalization to lead the way for political and social change. The repressive regime will continue to be a thorn in the side of world leaders who want to dismantle Pyongyang\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program.'b'But the economic changes hold great promise for improving the lives of millions of North Koreans who have suffered in deep poverty for decades. The new policies should be welcomed and supported by the outside world.'b'The impoverished countryside is the site of a major effort to open up the farming economy. My talks with North Korean refugees and migrant workers in China, as well as nongovernmental organization personnel on the ground, confirm what has been reported in South Korean media over the last few years: An agricultural system apparently implemented in 2013 allows farmers \xe2\x80\x94 who have always worked for a token payment and fixed rations \xe2\x80\x94 to register their households as \xe2\x80\x9cwork teams.\xe2\x80\x9d Such teams are now allowed to keep a larger portion of their harvest, some reports say more than 30 percent. Moreover, for the foreseeable future these family-based groups will toil in the same fields, year after year, giving them an incentive to take better care of the land. Before the change, farmers had worked on land that belonged to state-managed farms and were often moved from one field to another.'b'A new set of market-oriented reforms adopted by the Central Committee of the Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party and by the cabinet of ministers on May 30, 2014, appears to aim to liberalize the economy as a whole. The content of this classified economic policy document was first partially leaked to the South Korean daily Segye Ilbo in June. Later it was confirmed by many sources and is now widely discussed by Pyongyang watchers.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cMay 30 Measures,\xe2\x80\x9d as they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to be known, envision the significant reduction of state control of the economy and a dismantling of central planning. Managers of state enterprises will be allowed to purchase items on a free market, making deals with other enterprises or even private businesses. They will be given the right to fire and hire workers, and pay them as much as they want.'b'At coal mines near the border with China, where the new \xe2\x80\x9csystem of managerial responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d has been tested since late 2013, the best miners may now receive up to $70 a month, an exorbitant wage for the North.'b'Mr. Kim has also left untouched the unofficial private economy, which began to grow in the 1990s and now contributes significantly to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s tiny G.D.P., as much as 50 percent by some estimates. This economy of small businesses like food stalls, bicycle repair shops and truck deliveries, as well as larger ones like small coal mines and fishing companies, has never been explicitly accepted by the government. But since Mr. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s ascension, officials have left this gray market alone.'b'The agricultural reforms are already bearing fruit. In 2013, the country enjoyed the best harvest in decades when \xe2\x80\x94 in a first since the 1980s \xe2\x80\x94 it produced nearly enough food to feed its population on a subsistence level.'b'People on the ground are not surprised. Once farmers were turned from serfs to sharecroppers, the labor input increased dramatically, and it was enough to make a quick difference in  an economy where wooden plows and  oxen still reign supreme.'b'The 2014 harvest was also impressive, in spite of severe drought. European workers from nongovernmental organizations and groups of visiting Chinese experts whom I recently met say that the efficiency of the farmers who now work for a share of crops, instead of fixed rations, increased dramatically. Indeed, as one migrant worker in China told me: \xe2\x80\x9cFarmers take care of the fields, they now believe that the more they produce, the better they eat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The full impact of the reforms in industry will not be felt for a while, but it is likely to be strong: The Hyundai Research Institute even predicts that in 2015 North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product will increase 7 percent.'b'From Mr. Kim\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, it makes sense to usher in economic changes: The old system was slowly falling apart, eroding from within by the development of an unofficial economy and growing disappointment in the official ideology. The reforms are risky, but without reforms the regime is certainly doomed.'b'While the changes are positive for regular North Koreans, one should harbor no illusions: North Korea will remain a problematic place.'b'The regime will never surrender its 'b'nuclear weapons'b'. The leaders firmly believe that they need them as a diplomatic tool and as a deterrent, and their worries have not been ameliorated by the fate of Saddam Hussein and Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the only dictator in history who swapped his nuclear weapons program for the promise of economic benefits from the West.'b'North Korea will remain a human rights abuser. In China, economic reforms led to social liberalization; many Chinese can now do things that would have gotten them killed in the days of Mao. This is not going to happen in North Korea \xe2\x80\x94 because of South Korea.'b'Thanks to strict information control in the North, rumors abound about the economic success of the South, but the true scope of that success remains unknown. If ordinary North Koreans were to become less fearful of the authorities, while also learning about the affluence of the South, they might do what the East Germans did: get rid of the regime and pave the way for a unified Korean Peninsula. From the regime\xe2\x80\x99s viewpoint, this means that only by keeping the populace terrified (but better fed) do they have some chance of maintaining authority.'b'Nevertheless, a reforming North Korea will be an unstable place, with the specter of implosion always looming. The regime\xe2\x80\x99s implosion could mean a civil war in a nuclear state in a region where interests of the United States and China clash.'b'Still, a prospering North Korea will be less inclined to deliberately destabilize the environment: Its leaders will need stability in their neighborhood to make money. Even if North Korea remains repressive, the lives of citizens will improve. And few people would argue that living in a starving dictatorship is better than living in a modestly affluent one.'b''b'\n'b'Andrei Lankov, 'b' a historian of North Korea and a professor at Kookmin University in Seoul, is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Real North Korea.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 Since the Arab Spring 'b'began four years ago'b' whole swathes of the Middle East have been transformed from authoritarian police states into ungoverned, and ungovernable, spaces. In Iraq and Syria, the vacuum left by the receding state has been filled by various Islamist movements. Yet even in these countries, the national governments still retain sovereignty and control over their capital cities.'b'Not so in 'b'Libya'b', where rogue militias 'b'conquered Tripoli'b' in August and set up rival political institutions, forcing the internationally recognized House of Representatives to relocate to the eastern town of Tobruk. Since then, Libya boasts two administrations both claiming to be sovereign.'b'To preserve a semblance of neutrality, the 'b'Libyan Central Bank'b' pays salaries to the militias and bureaucrats of both warring blocs. For months, both sides had clung to hopes of scoring a decisive victory and riding off with the country\xe2\x80\x99s considerable oil wealth. As that prospect waned and the costs of prolonged conflict grew ever greater, moderates of both factions met for peace talks in Geneva. Progress at the negotiating table has led to a 'b'conditional cease-fire'b'.'b'The West\xe2\x80\x99s approach to this crisis has relied on an 'b'oversimplified narrative'b', which sees a legitimate anti-Islamist government in Tobruk facing off against an Islamist administration in Tripoli. This obscures reality: It is local leaders and militia commanders, and not the politicians of both administrations, who hold power in Libya. Moreover, the fighting had descended into a zero-sum grudge match unrelated to religion, with each side ruthlessly attempting to destroy its 'b'opponent\xe2\x80\x99s key infrastructure'b'. In response, businessmen and civic leaders urged their political and militia representatives to embrace dialogue. Some hard-line politicians have balked; they are now being left behind.'b'The coming negotiations should not merely include rival parliamentarians. They should also bring to the table local civic and militia leaders from different tribal and regional blocs, all of whom are seeking to save Libya from destruction while strengthening their positions in a post-conflict settlement.'b'All parties know that these talks are the last chance for a nonmilitary solution. If dialogue fails, the country will be de facto partitioned and the war over resources will resume with increased intensity. If that happens, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has threatened to push for a peacekeeping force.'b'If the international community wishes to give both sides the right incentives to reach a lasting deal, Western democracies must reconsider the logic behind their policies. The 'b'Nov. 6, 2014'b', ruling by the Tripoli-based Libyan Supreme Court provides the perfect pretext. It stated that the constitutional amendment giving rise to the House of Representatives was procedurally invalid, that the June 2014 election should never have happened, and that consequently the ensuing body cannot be vested with sovereignty.'b'Western nations have barely responded \xe2\x80\x94 meekly pointing out that they are studying the decision and that the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was made under duress. But Islamist militia pressure on the court does not necessarily invalidate its carefully worded opinion, which states that neither the House, nor its opponents, nor the expired Parliament, are to be considered Libya\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign authority.'b'Western governments are reluctant to acknowledge the implications of the Supreme Court ruling because many of them are secretly cheering for the Tobruk faction to either reconquer the country or dominate a national unity government. After all, the Tobruk government claims to be fighting Ansar al-Sharia in Benghazi \xe2\x80\x94 the very same group that 'b'killed the American ambassador'b', Christopher Stevens, in 2012.'b'Perversely, the West\xe2\x80\x99s ability to act as a neutral party and promote compromise is hindered by the fact that it has already recognized Tobruk as Libya\xe2\x80\x99s sole sovereign. This aligns the United States and Europe with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which are 'b'backing'b' Tobruk militarily out of a desire to defeat the Muslim Brotherhood throughout the region. Conversely, Tobruk\xe2\x80\x99s opponents receive significant support from Qatar and Turkey.'b'The door is still open for Western nations to formally withdraw their recognition of the House of Representatives in light of the Supreme Court decision. Because the Islamist-aligned \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment\xe2\x80\x9d in Tripoli is 'b'fracturing by the day'b' and possesses an even more tenuous claim to legitimacy than its rival, such a move would leave Libya without any sovereign authority.'b'Western nations should make clear that they will not recognize any sovereign authority if negotiations fail to produce a national unity government committed to completing the constitutional process. They should also take strong steps to prevent regional interference while simultaneously inviting both sides\xe2\x80\x99 external patrons to the table.'b'Once denied outside assistance, the legal trappings of sovereignty, or the possibility of acquiring either via force, both warring blocs would run out of cash and face strong incentives to compromise.'b'And with 'b'oil prices at historic lows'b', the incentives for rogue actors to smuggle pirated oil would be marginal. Finding buyers, even among Russian mafia syndicates or the Libyan factions\xe2\x80\x99 Gulf patrons, would be challenging.'b'Critics argue that withdrawing recognition of the House of Representatives would be a reward to rogue militias for their brutal takeover of Tripoli and their ongoing support of jihadi elements. They also claim that it would provide an incentive for the Islamists to make the talks fail. Both assertions are false. If the West pledges that it will only recognize a Libyan government committed to a transition to constitutional governance, that would effectively stifle the dream of many Islamists that seek to capture the Libyan state and its resources by force.'b'The war in Libya is not about religion or ideology; it is about greed and vengeance.

Women have long been involved in terror of all stripes, from female neo-Nazis in Europe to Chechen \xe2\x80\x9cblack widow\xe2\x80\x9d suicide bombers.'b'Indeed, despite stereotypes about their domesticity and passivity \xe2\x80\x94 the idea that they must always be under men\xe2\x80\x99s influence or tricked into joining \xe2\x80\x94 women are drawn to groups like the Islamic State by many of the same forces as men: adventure, inequality, alienation and the pull of the cause.'b'Once there, they commit violence against other women, including as part of all-female brigades enforcing female morality codes requiring modest dress and sex segregation. They operate checkpoints and go on home raids; they are also reportedly recruiters, trainers of female suicide bombers, wives and homemakers, fund-raisers and propagandists. They also help sanitize the group\xe2\x80\x99s image by posting photos of themselves drinking milkshakes on Instagram and writing chatty, lighthearted tweets.'b'But the news media and policy makers are playing catch-up when it comes to understanding the full extent of women\xe2\x80\x99s roles in jihadist groups. A large part of the problem is the tendency to fixate on terrorist violence against women, whether it be Boko Haram\xe2\x80\x99s mass kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria or the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s sexual violence, slavery, kidnappings and forced marriage. We prefer to see terror through the lens of gender, positing radical Muslim men against women, with the West as their only defender.'b'Myths and misinformation abound. Islamic State fighters are afraid of Kurdish all-women brigades (they aren\xe2\x80\x99t). Women join groups like the Islamic State only to become \xe2\x80\x9cjihadi brides\xe2\x80\x9d (they don\xe2\x80\x99t). The Islamic State mandated 'b'female genital mutilation'b' in Mosul, Iraq (it didn\xe2\x80\x99t).'b'Aphorisms about the motivations of terrorists are appealing; if only it were true that, as the saying goes, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat terrorists fear most is educated girls.\xe2\x80\x9d But building schools and investing in girls\xe2\x80\x99 education should be long-term investments that are ends in themselves, not knee-jerk reactions to extremist violence. Merely defining the West in contrast to \xe2\x80\x9cbarbarism\xe2\x80\x9d and talking of \xe2\x80\x9crescuing\xe2\x80\x9d women fall short at best; at worst, doing so sets women up as symbolic targets for terrorist violence, squeezing them between terror and counterterror.'b'Instead, more attention must be paid to the specific factors that attract women to terrorist groups and the roles they play once there. For example, European women in the Islamic State have spoken of how alienation and restrictions on their religious practices back home, like France\xe2\x80\x99s ban on wearing burqas in public, helped push them into the group (Ms. Boumeddiene\xe2\x80\x99s reported loss of her job as a cashier for wearing the niqab should be examined in this light).'b'Efforts to prevent women from leaving for Iraq and Syria need to address such grievances, just as programs for those who return must be tailored to their specific experiences in the group. The strong influence of social media and peer networks also points to including more young women in these efforts, as well as female community leaders and family members.'b'This may not sound like much, but for some governments, such targeted approaches are a long way off. Many still deny women\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in terror at all, particularly in jihadist groups, or focus only on women\xe2\x80\x99s role in preventing men from radicalizing. Meanwhile, those same groups are deploying more female suicide bombers who can easily evade detection because of such blind spots. Earlier this month Boko Haram detonated bombs strapped to three girls \xe2\x80\x94 possibly some of the abducted schoolchildren \xe2\x80\x94 who were able to make it past security guards because of their age and gender.'b'Terrorists are strategic about using women, in increasingly chilling ways. To fight them, we have to move past simplistic assumptions about gender and terror and get serious about helping women and girls who are on this deadly path, as well as their would-be victims.'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA\xe2\x80\x99S economic proposals in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address were a disappointment. His ideas \xe2\x80\x94 free community college, an enhanced tax credit for child care and higher taxes on high-income earners and large financial institutions \xe2\x80\x94 failed to go beyond mere talking points. With no chance of engaging the Republicans, they will surely die without a hearing.'b'But the president\xe2\x80\x99s proposals do invite a case for a comprehensive tax and entitlement reform, one based not on redistribution but on growth, work and opportunity.'b'Our unwillingness to confront mounting inefficiencies in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s tax code and growing obligations in entitlement programs has led to increasingly limited options.\xc2\xa0Corporate tax reform is held hostage to the misguided idea that tax cuts and tax increases must be balanced within the corporate sector alone, and to the faulty assumption that beneficial tax reform will not raise economic activity.'b'Piling up child tax credits and subsidies for health care over narrow household income ranges, as the president proposes, leads to high rates of taxation on earnings from work as assistance is phased out.\xc2\xa0Likewise, raising marginal tax rates on investment by the well-to-do reduces asset prices and is a threat to continued economic expansion.'b'So how 'b'can 'b'we enhance growth, work and opportunity? Four steps can help get us there.'b'The first is to move to a simple business tax system, with a lower marginal tax rate and no special industry preferences. There would be no separate corporate tax, only a single business income tax for all businesses. Ideally, investment would be expensed, and its cost deducted in the year it was made, rather than deducted gradually. Businesses would be able to bring back overseas profits free of additional United States taxes. A one-time modest tax on current overseas earning could be used to help finance reform. Such a business income tax would encourage both growth and investment opportunities in the United States, while offering more jobs and higher wages to American workers.'b'The second step is to use the individual income tax to better reward work. The top tax rate for most Americans would be the same as the business income tax rate. To maintain progressivity, a surtax on wages would be collected on very high earners. To make work more attractive, low-income workers, including single workers, would receive an expanded earned-income tax credit and a tax credit to buy health insurance (as opposed to the more complex subsidies that exist under the Affordable Care Act). The earned-income tax credit would be phased out gradually.'b'Workers would have the choice of switching to options available under current law for employer-provided health insurance and a health savings account, or a tax deduction for their own health insurance and health savings account as incomes rise. Reductions in marginal tax rates to support work would be paid for by limits on tax deductions for more affluent households.'b'The third step focuses on education and training. Like investment in technology and machines, investment in human capital should be deductible from income. Out-of-pocket educational expenses for bona fide\xc2\xa0schooling and vocational training could be tax deductible for all but affluent households. Personal re-employment accounts could be made available to all individuals facing more than temporary unemployment, with individual financial support for training and a bonus for re-employment.'b'The fourth step is to strengthen retirement security, while acknowledging the need for fiscal consolidation in entitlement spending. Minimum benefits for Social Security and Medicare could be strengthened to ensure that people with low lifetime incomes avoid poverty in old age. To reduce future deficits in these programs and to free up funds to support work and opportunity for younger workers in the future, Social Security benefit growth would be slowed for more affluent individuals.'b'In the same spirit, changing Medicare so that individuals would purchase insurance from one of a number of competing plans, with the federal government paying part of the cost, could focus the largest subsidies for health insurance on those with low lifetime incomes. Converting Medicaid to a block grant \xe2\x80\x94 in which federal support would be turned over to states \xe2\x80\x94 would give governors the flexibility to support health insurance tax credits for low-income residents, community health centers or other experiments in health insurance and delivery at the state level.'b'These four steps offer a road map for growth, work and opportunity without sacrificing income security. Other policies, including free trade, open competition and immigration reform, are also important. But these four steps can take place in a budget discussion, and congressional leaders and the White House have both emphasized the need for a more timely budget resolution.'b'While the reforms I sketched are comprehensive, they can be implemented in discrete steps \xe2\x80\x94 no \xe2\x80\x9cgrand bargain\xe2\x80\x9d is required. And realistic proposals to advance growth, work and opportunity, not ideological talking points, are what we need right now.'b'So the Republican establishment is breathing easy now that the Supreme Court is on the verge of issuing a ruling in favor of 'b'same-sex marriage'b', thus taking the question out of nasty old politics? \xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to be a relief,\xe2\x80\x9d a Republican committeeman from California 'b'told'b' Jeremy W. Peters and Jonathan Martin of The New York Times, explaining that with such a ruling, \xe2\x80\x9cthen it\xe2\x80\x99s off the table.\xe2\x80\x9d Praise the Lord and thank the court.'b'You have to admire the chutzpah of party operatives whose national platform calls for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples, and for whom denouncing \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial activism\xe2\x80\x9d is usually as natural as saluting the flag, lining up right behind the justices who they hope will relieve them of the pesky problem of choosing sides in a fast-fading culture war.'b'But the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 sighs of relief are premature: not because the court will let them down by sending the marriage issue back to the states (of course it may, but I doubt it will), but because marriage equality isn\xe2\x80\x99t the end of the story. It is only, to borrow from Winston Churchill, the end of the beginning.'b'Last April, the Supreme Court ducked 'b'a case'b' that pitted the asserted right of a company \xe2\x80\x94 a New Mexico wedding photography shop \xe2\x80\x94 to refuse to provide its services to a same-sex couple against the couple\xe2\x80\x99s right to be served like anyone else by a business licensed to open its doors to the public. The company, Elane Photography, had lost in the New Mexico Supreme Court. It brought a free-speech claim on appeal, arguing that its owner was being compelled by the state (New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s Human Rights Act covers sexual orientation) to use her \xe2\x80\x9cexpressive\xe2\x80\x9d photographic talents in violation of her religious beliefs.'b'The justices turned the appeal down without comment or recorded dissent. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the court didn\xe2\x80\x99t look closely at the case, Elane Photography v. Willock, which it took to its closed-door, justices-only conference for three consecutive weeks. And that case was just the leading edge of a pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s worth of cases in which florists, bakers and owners of wedding venues are invoking claims of conscience to shield them from having to do business with gay men and lesbians.'b'If this issue appears less than earth-shattering \xe2\x80\x94 won\xe2\x80\x99t there always be a friendlier florist, baker or hotel owner around the corner? \xe2\x80\x94 then try substituting \xe2\x80\x9cinterracial couple\xe2\x80\x9d as the object of discrimination in the years after the Supreme Court, in 'b'Loving v. Virginia'b', struck down state prohibitions on interracial marriage. Of course, by 1967, when the court ruled in Loving, Congress had passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, with its prohibition against racial discrimination in employment and public accommodations. (It took until 1983, in the 'b'Bob Jones case'b', for the court to rule that a university that claimed a religious basis for a ban on interracial dating among its students was therefore ineligible for tax-exempt status.) There is no federal anti-discrimination law that applies to sexual orientation, and 29 states lack such laws as well.'b'A federal measure called the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, protecting gays and lesbians against discrimination on the job, has been pending for years. A version passed the Senate in 2013 but died in the Republican-controlled House. Some major gay-rights groups withdrew their support for the bill last year because the current version contains such a broad set of religion-based exemptions. For example, a religious organization is permitted to require broad categories of employees \xe2\x80\x94 well beyond those who directly serve the organization\xe2\x80\x99s religious mission \xe2\x80\x94 to adhere to a set of \xe2\x80\x9csignificant religious tenets,\xe2\x80\x9d the definition of which would not be subject to judicial review, that plausibly would make it impossible for a gay person to obtain or keep a job.'b'A bill now pending in the Virginia House of Delegates would permit any licensed business, private or public, to refuse service to gay or bisexual people because of \xe2\x80\x9creligious or moral convictions\xe2\x80\x9d held by the business owner \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to same-sex \xe2\x80\x98marriage\xe2\x80\x99 or homosexual behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d (The bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, Delegate Bob Marshall, a co-sponsor of the state\xe2\x80\x99s ban on same-sex marriage that was struck down last year in federal court, placed the word \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d in quotes in the text of the bill.)'b'If the Virginia bill got through the Legislature, Terry McAuliffe, the state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic governor, would veto it. It won\xe2\x80\x99t become law, but in the meantime, every Republican legislator in the increasingly purple state will have to choose sides.'b'The fact is that religion is on the march, and it can only be emboldened by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling last June in the 'b'Hobby Lobby case'b'. That decision, the legal consequences of which are still playing out, permitted an employer running an ordinary for-profit retail business to claim a religious exemption from compliance with the federal requirement to include contraception coverage in its employee insurance plan. (And on Tuesday of this week, the court abandoned its age-old stance of deference toward prison administrators and ruled that a Muslim prison inmate had the right under federal law to keep a beard despite the Arkansas prison\xe2\x80\x99s ban on facial hair. While Islam does not require men to wear beards, the inmate\xe2\x80\x99s belief that he should have one was sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9csincere\xe2\x80\x9d to invoke the statute\xe2\x80\x99s protections, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. 'b'wrote'b' for the unanimous court.)'b'However the justices proceed to resolve the increasingly audacious claims of religious conscience in a post-Hobby Lobby, post-marriage equality world, it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to predict that politicians will be confronting these issues under the glare of a public spotlight. Republicans who expect the Supreme Court to give them a pass from having to take a stand are in for a rude surprise.'b'The same might be said of the consequences for Republicans of prevailing in their latest attack on the Affordable Care Act. This spring, the Supreme Court will hear 'b'arguments'b' in King v. Burwell, the cynical effort manufactured by right-wing think tanks to unravel the law (I\xe2\x80\x99ve 'b'written'b' about this case previously.) At stake is whether the insurance exchanges the federal government set up when 36 Republican-led states refused to set up their own will be dismantled, and whether the millions people who bought subsidized policies on the federal exchanges will have to look elsewhere or go without.'b'Leading Republicans, including Mitch McConnell, now the Senate majority leader, 'b'cheered'b' when the court agreed to hear the case. But now some conservatives are getting cold feet at the prospect of actually winning. They are contemplating the morning-after question: now what? Suppose constituents who have paid no attention to the seemingly arcane issue in the case turn to their Republican governors and say something like: The Supreme Court says the law will work only with state exchanges, so why can\xe2\x80\x99t we have a state exchange? In other words: Save our insurance.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been grimly amusing to watch the scramble that\xe2\x80\x99s now taking place as some of the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent detractors realize they might actually need something with which to placate not only consumers but also the insurance and health care industries. Randy E. Barnett, an architect of the original constitutional attack on the law, published 'b'an op-ed'b' last month in USA Today under the title \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Finally Kill Obamacare.\xe2\x80\x9d Republicans \xe2\x80\x9cneed to start right away,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, in order to have a \xe2\x80\x9cwell-vetted replacement in the pipeline\xe2\x80\x9d that would serve the additional purpose of assuring the justices that they would not simply be tossing millions of people into a void. Among his proposals is to \xe2\x80\x9crestore the private insurance market\xe2\x80\x9d by pricing insurance \xe2\x80\x9caccording to risk\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, to do away with a centerpiece of the current law, which relies on the principles of \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed issue\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity rating\xe2\x80\x9d to bar insurers from penalizing people who have ever actually needed medical care.'b'A Wall Street Journal op-ed by Yuval Levin and James C. Capretta, two associates of conservative policy organizations, 'b'took'b' a different, tax credit-based approach but with a similar goal: \xe2\x80\x9cShow the public that the 'b'G.O.P.'b' has a concrete alternative to offer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Is that a still, small voice that I hear: quick, somebody please take me off the hook?

Another brother moved to the next town over, Minden, a big city relatively speaking (it has 13,000 people), where he is a high school teacher. Minden, just west of Gibsland, is also majority African-American and relatively poor \xe2\x80\x94 55 percent of the residents are black, the median household income is $30,411 and 24 percent of the residents are poor.'b'For years, one of the largest employers in that area was the Louisiana Army Ammunition Plant, about four miles from Minden. The Environmental Protection Agency eventually listed the plant as a Superfund site because for more than 40 years \xe2\x80\x9cuntreated explosives-laden wastewater from industrial operations was collected in concrete sumps at each of the various load line areas,\xe2\x80\x9d and emptied into \xe2\x80\x9c16 one-acre pink water lagoons.\xe2\x80\x9d It was determined that the toxic contamination in soil and sediments from the lagoons was a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor contributor\xe2\x80\x9d to toxic groundwater contamination.'b'But wait, it gets worse.'b'When the plant ceased production, as The Times-Picayune of New Orleans pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Army awarded now-bankrupt Explo Systems a contract in 2010 to \xe2\x80\x98demilitarize\xe2\x80\x99 the propellant charges for artillery rounds\xe2\x80\x9d on the site.

In it, he pointed out that nearly 60 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s hazardous-waste landfill capacity was in \xe2\x80\x9cfive Southern states (i.e., Alabama, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas),\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cfour landfills in minority ZIP codes areas represented 63 percent of the South\xe2\x80\x99s total hazardous-waste capacity\xe2\x80\x9d although \xe2\x80\x9cblacks make up only about 20 percent of the South\xe2\x80\x99s total population.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More recently, in 2012, a study by researchers at Yale found that \xe2\x80\x9cThe greater the concentration of Hispanics, Asians, African-Americans or poor residents in an area, the more likely that potentially dangerous compounds such as vanadium, nitrates and zinc are in the mix of fine particles they breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among the injustices perpetrated on poor and minority populations, this may in fact be the most pernicious and least humane: the threat of poisoning the very air that you breathe.'b'I have skin in this game. My family would fall in the shadow of the plume. But everyone should be outraged about this practice. Of all the measures of equality we deserve, the right to feel assured and safe when you draw a breath should be paramount.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s raise the gas tax.'b'There are several reasons we need to discuss this now. One is that plummeting gasoline prices make the idea very timely. Also, people will be asking you this week what you thought of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address. Even though he did not mention the gas tax, bringing it up will allow you to avoid having an opinion on whether it\xe2\x80\x99s time to close the capital gains stepped-up-basis loophole.'b'The gas tax raises much-needed money for roads and mass transit. Our roads, you may have noticed, are falling apart. Every time you hit a pothole, yell: \xe2\x80\x9cRaise the gas tax!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even more important, it encourages Americans to use fuel-efficient cars. While we\xe2\x80\x99re all happy as clams about falling gas prices, every gallon produces more than 19 pounds of planet-warming emissions. We just had the hottest year on record. The ice floes are melting. Walruses keep piling up along the Alaskan shore, where the babies can get squashed.'b'Raise the gas tax and remember the walruses.'b'Plus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not really a tax! Or at least not necessarily. Just ask Ronald Reagan. When he entered office, Reagan said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the likelihood of a gas tax increase \xe2\x80\x9cunless there\xe2\x80\x99s a palace coup.\xe2\x80\x9d But then, you know, stuff happened and The Great Communicator discovered that a levy on gasoline wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a tax, but merely a \xe2\x80\x9cuser fee.\xe2\x80\x9d So no problem at all, and under his administration the, um, fee was more than doubled.'b'Ah, Ronald Reagan. Perhaps you noticed, during the State of the Union, that President Obama was urging Congress to bring the capital gains tax back up to Reagan-era levels? Who\xe2\x80\x99d have thought? We live in ironic times, people.'b'But about the gas tax. It was also raised under George H.W. (The Good One) Bush, and then again under Bill Clinton. Remember Al Gore breaking the tie in the Senate? Ah, Al Gore.'b'And that was it. The federal gas tax, currently 18.4 cents a gallon, is not indexed for inflation, and it has not gone up since 1993. The Highway Trust Fund, which pays for the federal highway construction program, keeps falling deeper into the red. It\xe2\x80\x99s currently scheduled to implode sometime this spring.'b'The White House has been very clear about its lack of enthusiasm for solving the problem with a gas tax increase. Mainly, the objection is that if Congress wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t pass Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to pay for early education with a tobacco tax, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to fund road repair with a gas tax. This is a pretty good point. However, deeply cynical souls could also argue that the current majority likes road construction more than preschool.'b'During the State of the Union, Obama made his pitch for another idea: reform the tax on overseas business profits, creating a one-time-only windfall of revenue for the government to use in a mega-road-building spree.'b'Three reasons the gas tax is a better idea:'b'1) Walruses.'b'2) Half the members of Congress are eyeing that very same windfall to pay for their own pet programs.'b'3) Only works once. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a coward\xe2\x80\x99s way out,\xe2\x80\x9d says Senator Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican. Genuine fiscal conservatives hate the idea of paying for permanent ongoing programs with one-shot revenues. Corker has been known to complain that he\xe2\x80\x99s been in the Senate for eight years and never saw Congress permanently solve a problem.'b'Last year Corker and Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat of Connecticut, floated the idea of raising the gas tax 12 cents over two years. \xe2\x80\x9cOur bet when we went out on a limb last year was that we could position it as a topic for serious discussion this year, and I hope it\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Murphy.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s working, sort of. A number of prominent Republicans have been muttering things like \xe2\x80\x9cnothing is off the table.\xe2\x80\x9d Senator James Inhofe, the new chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and a man whose position on global warming makes him an enemy to walruses everywhere, has said a gas tax is \xe2\x80\x9cone of the options.\xe2\x80\x9d An option that is not off the table! Truly, the worm has turned.'b'On the other hand, Representative Paul Ryan, the new chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently announced: \xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t pass a gas tax.\xe2\x80\x9d That would seem to be somewhat discouraging, but there are still these gleams of hope that Republicans might come around since:'b'\xe2\x80\x94 You can call it a user fee. (Ask Ronald Reagan.)'b'\xe2\x80\x94 President Obama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like it.'b'\xe2\x80\x94 Compromise is possible. Many conservatives hate the fact that the Highway Trust Fund also helps support mass transit and invests in things like highway beautification and bike paths. There might be some room for give here. Let\xe2\x80\x99s throw something in the fund under the proverbial bus. I nominate \xe2\x80\x9ctransportation museums.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Walrus seconds the motion.'b'As presented in 'b'his State of the State address'b' on Wednesday, 'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious projects'b' for his second term include a much-needed increase in the minimum wage, reform of the justice system, some forgiveness of student loans and a new commission to determine fair pay for legislators. At the top of his list is reforming the New York\xe2\x80\x99s educational system. This is a laudable undertaking that has long needed addressing, Mr. Cuomo said, but also one that will put him directly at loggerheads with the powerful teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions.'b'The governor left unanswered a raft of questions, including whether he\xe2\x80\x99s really getting to the heart of the problem. Most of New York\xe2\x80\x99s educational difficulties are about money, beginning with the politically skewed and unfair way the Legislature hands out money for schools, often depriving the poorest and the least politically powerful districts of the funds and support they need.'b'The governor, who also used the speech to outline a $150 billion budget, conceded that his proposals would be hard to pass in a Legislature divided between a Democratic Assembly and a Republican Senate. But he made clear his willingness to use the budget as a cudgel, which he has become particularly adept at doing. If the Legislature passes his reforms, he said, he would add an additional $1.1 billion (or 4.8 percent) in the pot for schools. If not, he warned, he would limit the increase to 1.7 percent.'b'Among Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s top priorities is to revamp a teacher evaluation system that he calls \xe2\x80\x9cbaloney.\xe2\x80\x9d Fewer than 1 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s teachers were rated ineffective in the most recent evaluations, while only about a third of the state\xe2\x80\x99s students in grades 3 through 8 were proficient in math and language arts. He wants to make it harder for teachers to get tenure and easier to fire ineffective and bad teachers. He wants to bring in a receiver or turnaround specialist to take over schools designated as failing for three years. And he wants to increase the number of charter schools while adding an \xe2\x80\x9canti-creaming\xe2\x80\x9d provision to make certain these schools don\xe2\x80\x99t pick the best students. He wants to require these schools to take a certain percentage of poor or disadvantaged students.'b'Holding the $23.1 billion education budget hostage to reform, however, could mean shorting the state\xe2\x80\x99s schoolchildren. Most estimates of the need, particularly in poorer areas, run from $2 billion to more than $5 billion a year over the present budget.'b'Many of his proposals are likely to ignite the ire of teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions that did not endorse him in the last election, and he can expect considerable resistance from them and their friends in Albany. On the whole, these provisions make good sense. In the long run, however, the most important thing he can do to help the system and the students it is meant to serve is to make sure that all districts \xe2\x80\x94 not just the wealthier ones \xe2\x80\x94 receive the money they need.'b'Since the end of the 1970s, something has gone profoundly wrong in America.'b'Inequality has soared. 'b'Educational progress slowed'b'. Incarceration rates quintupled. Family breakdown accelerated. Median household income stagnated.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s morning again in America\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that was a campaign slogan by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. But, in retrospect, the average American has been stuck since the Reagan era in a predawn darkness of stagnation and inequality, and we still haven\xe2\x80\x99t shaken it off, particularly since 2000. Inequality has increased further under President Obama.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the context for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s call, in 'b'his State of the Union address'b', for greater economic fairness. But first, the caveats. His proposals are dead on arrival in Congress. They won\xe2\x80\x99t be implemented and probably won\xe2\x80\x99t change the public\xe2\x80\x99s thinking: 'b'Research by George C. Edwards'b', a political scientist, finds that presidential speeches rarely persuade the public much.'b'Remember the 2014 State of the Union address? Of course not. Of 18 proposals in it, there was action on two, 'b'according to PBS'b'. Or Obama\xe2\x80\x99s passionate call in his 2013 State of the Union for measures to reduce gun violence? Nothing much resulted, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cguns\xe2\x80\x9d didn\xe2\x80\x99t even pass his lips this time.'b'Yet the bully pulpit still can shape the national agenda and nag at the American conscience. I don\xe2\x80\x99t fully agree with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s solutions \xe2\x80\x94 how could he skip over early-childhood interventions?! \xe2\x80\x94 but he\xe2\x80\x99s exactly right in the way he framed the inequality issue: \xe2\x80\x9cWill we accept an economy where only a few of us do spectacularly well?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some background. Even with the global Great Depression, the United States performed brilliantly in the first three-quarters of the 20th century, with incomes and education mostly rising and inequality flat or falling \xe2\x80\x94 and gains were broadly shared by poor and rich alike. High school graduation rates surged, G.I.\xe2\x80\x99s went to college, and the United States led the world in educational attainment.'b'And, in part of this remarkable era, the top federal income tax rate 'b'exceeded 90 percent'b'. Republicans might remember that point when they warn that Obama\xe2\x80\x99s proposals for modestly higher taxes would savage the American economy.'b'Then, for average Americans, the roof fell in around the end of the 1970s. The \xe2\x80\x9970s were \xe2\x80\x9cthe end of normal,\xe2\x80\x9d the economist James K. Galbraith argues in a new book of that title. Afterward, the economy continued to grow over all, but the spoils went to the wealthy and the bottom 90 percent barely benefited.'b'Median household income is little greater today than it was in 1979. Today, 'b'the typical family in Canada appears better off'b' than the typical American family.'b'By some measures, education \xe2\x80\x94 our seed corn for the future \xe2\x80\x94 has pretty much stalled. More young American men today have less education than their parents (29 percent) than have more education (20 percent). Among industrialized countries as a whole, 70 percent of 3-year-olds go to preschool; in the United States, 38 percent do.'b'I wonder if the celebration of unfettered capitalism and \xe2\x80\x9cgreed is good\xe2\x80\x9d since the Reagan era didn\xe2\x80\x99t help shape social mores in ways that accelerated inequality.'b'In any case, Reagan was right on one point \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe best social program is a productive job\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and Obama offered sound proposals to increase incentives for work. Better child-care and sick-leave policies would also make work more feasible. The United States is the only country among the 34 in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development that provides no paid maternity leave.'b'Oddly, Obama didn\xe2\x80\x99t push early-childhood initiatives, focused on kids from newborns to 5 years old, that have a particularly strong evidence base for creating opportunity.'b'Early-education initiatives poll well, and some of the leaders in programming have been red states like Oklahoma. So while the Obama agenda is mostly for show, expansion of preschool could actually occur at least at the state level.'b'Obama rightly heralded the fall in teenage pregnancy rates. But he had little to do with it (although the MTV show \xe2\x80\x9c16 and Pregnant\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'played a role!'b'), and about 30 percent of American girls still get pregnant by age 19. Making reliable birth control available to at-risk teenagers 'b'would help them'b', reduce abortion rates and even pay for itself in reduced social spending later.'b'In America, 'b'we have subsidized private jets'b', big banks and hedge fund managers. Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it make more sense to subsidize kids? So if higher capital gains taxes can pay for better education, infrastructure and jobs, of course that trade-off is worthwhile.'b'Congressional Republicans seem focused on a pipeline that isn\xe2\x80\x99t even economically viable at today\xe2\x80\x99s oil prices. Let\xe2\x80\x99s hope that the national agenda can broaden along the lines that Obama suggests, so that the last 35 years become an aberration rather than a bellwether.'b'Under Chief Justice John Roberts Jr., the Supreme Court has developed a remarkably sanguine view of race in America. \xe2\x80\x9cThings have changed dramatically,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Roberts 'b'wrote'b' in 2013 in striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act.'b'In other words, he seemed to suggest, this is no longer the country of Bull Connor and fire hoses, and any lingering effects of our entrenched history of racial discrimination are best dealt with if everyone would simply agree to treat each other as equals.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Roberts 'b'wrote'b' in a 2007 case.'b'The court\xe2\x80\x99s latest target in its quest for a race-blind nation is the 'b'Fair Housing Act'b', approved by Congress in 1968 as the final cornerstone of civil rights legislation and broadened in 1988. The act makes it illegal to refuse to sell, rent \xe2\x80\x9cor otherwise make unavailable or deny\xe2\x80\x9d a property to anyone because of race, sex or other protected categories.'b'The question before the judges during oral arguments on Wednesday morning was this: Does that language require that the discrimination be intentional, or does it allow plaintiffs to claim a discriminatory effect, regardless of intent?'b'If ever there was a legal issue that appeared to be settled, this is it. Over four decades, every one of the 11 federal appeals courts to consider the law has found that it covers claims of discriminatory effect. A 2013 'b'regulation'b' issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides explicitly for such claims.'b'This legal consensus is easy to understand. The law was meant to be a broad and powerful tool against the effects of unjust discrimination in housing. Today, persistent housing segregation remains a fact of life for many blacks, with a range of adverse consequences including poorer economic prospects, lower property values and inferior public schools.'b'The ability to show discriminatory effect has only become more important as intentional discrimination has become harder to prove. To take one prominent example, the Justice Department relied on it to negotiate 'b'the largest-ever fair-lending settlement'b' \xe2\x80\x94 $335 million \xe2\x80\x94 with Bank of America in 2011. The bank\xe2\x80\x99s mortgage unit, Countrywide Financial, had charged higher average fees and interest rates to black and Latino borrowers than to whites with the same credit risk, a practice that former assistant attorney general Thomas Perez called \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination with a smile.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even so, the Roberts court had agreed on two earlier occasions to review the scope of the act, suggesting to many people that it is not happy with the law\xe2\x80\x99s mainstream interpretation. The cases were withdrawn or settled at the last minute, with help from the federal government and civil-rights groups worried about how the court would rule.'b'On Wednesday, the justices finally 'b'got their shot'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a third case, out of Dallas, involving federal tax credits that encourage developers to build low-income housing.'b'The challengers argue that the law\xe2\x80\x99s language was never meant to cover anything beyond intentional discrimination. If it did, they say, insurers, developers and lenders could be forced to make race-based decisions in order to avoid liability under the law.'b'During oral argument, Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to support the law\xe2\x80\x99s broader reading. When Congress amended the act in 1988, 'b'he reminded'b' the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer, it was clearly aware of the discriminatory effect standard, yet did not write it out of the law. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that kill your case?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'b'The Fair Housing Act has functioned well, and to the benefit of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable renters and home buyers, for more than 40 years. The court could demonstrate a greater appreciation of the stubborn and long-term effects of racial discrimination, not to mention a basic respect for the expertise of a federal agency, by upholding the universal interpretation of the appellate courts.'b'When we think of the civil rights struggles of the 1960s, certain events tend to come to mind: the March on Washington, for example, or perhaps the Freedom Rides or sit-ins. Others, however, have faded from our collective memory. One of those is the story of the Black Panther Party, the subject of this Op-Doc video. Founded in 1966 in Oakland, Calif., to combat police violence, the Black Panther Party and its story are a key part of our nation\xe2\x80\x99s still-complicated racial narrative.'b'When it was conceived, the Black Panther Party called for \xe2\x80\x9can immediate end to police brutality and murder of Black people.\xe2\x80\x9d Relying on the right to bear arms contained in the Second Amendment to the Constitution, the Panthers organized armed citizen patrols to monitor police behavior. It was a controversial approach to an intractable problem, but it provoked important debate.'b'Of course, the police violence and misconduct that inspired the founding of the Black Panther Party 50 years ago have not gone away. In just the last six months, the deaths of Michael Brown, John Crawford III, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice \xe2\x80\x93 and the lack of indictment of police officers for any of their deaths \xe2\x80\x94 have shaken black communities to the core.'b'But today, unlike in the 1960s, there are no shootouts between protesters and police. There are no organized groups calling for armed revolution on the evening news. Young people protesting police violence are armed not with rifles, but cellphones; shouting not \xe2\x80\x9cOff the Pig,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cHands Up, Don\xe2\x80\x99t Shoot,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI Can\xe2\x80\x99t Breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d Though the problems remain the same, the protests are different. What we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to see is whether police departments and elected officials will be any more responsive to demands for change and accountability than they were 50 years ago.'b'Yes, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the March on Washington are part of the political legacy inherited by today\xe2\x80\x99s activists. But so too is the Black Panther Party. Both stories inform not only where we are today, but also where we might be heading.'b''b'This video is part of a series produced by independent filmmakers who have received major support from the Ford Foundation and additional support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute.'b''b'Op-Docs is The New York Times editorial department\xe2\x80\x99s award-winning forum for short, opinionated documentaries, produced with wide creative latitude and a range of artistic styles, covering current affairs, contemporary life and historical subjects.'b'Op-Doc videos are produced by both renowned and emerging filmmakers who express their views in the first person, through their subjects, or more subtly through an artistic approach to a topic.

The Justice Department abandoned an attempt to force James Risen, a New York Times reporter, to testify about a confidential source. And it tempered internal guidelines for trying to obtain records or testimony from the news media during leak investigations.'b'But these developments are gallingly late, and they do not really settle the big issues raised by President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s devoted pursuit of whistle-blowers and the reporters who receive their information.'b'Mr. Risen was being threatened with a jail sentence in the trial of Jeffrey Sterling, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who is charged with providing classified information for a chapter in a book by Mr. Risen detailing a botched covert effort during the Clinton administration to thwart Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program. The decision not to try to compel Mr. Risen\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was announced in a court motion last week \xe2\x80\x94 but only after Mr. Risen was made to testify at a pretrial hearing and said he would neither reveal his confidential sources nor provide details that might help the government identify them.'b'Soon after the motion was filed, the Justice Department announced a revision in guidelines on leak investigations to delete a reference that offered protections only to \xe2\x80\x9cordinary news-gathering activities\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a vague term that could have been exploited by zealous prosecutors.'b'Both shifts seemed like an attempt by Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. to soften his reputation before he leaves office. It\xe2\x80\x99s not yet clear whether they mean more respect over time for the crucial role of a free press and the ability of reporters to protect their sources.'b'They do not erase the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s record of bringing more leak cases than all the president\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors combined. Beyond the Risen case, the Justice Department secretly subpoenaed telephone records from Associated Press reporters and editors during a leak investigation and obtained a search warrant for a Fox News reporter\xe2\x80\x99s emails as part of another inquiry.'b'The abandoned pursuit of Mr. Risen leaves behind an atrocious legal precedent: a 2-to-1 ruling in 2013 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia, which denied the existence of any reporter\xe2\x80\x99s privilege in the First Amendment or common law. That position was advocated by the Justice Department, and it was repeated in briefs asking the Supreme Court to deny Mr. Risen\xe2\x80\x99s request for review, which it did. The Fourth Circuit includes Maryland and Virginia, home to most national security agencies.'b'Two things are clear. First, dedicated journalists like Mr. Risen are willing to stand up to protect the identity of their sources. The second is the need for a strong federal shield law broadly protective of reporters who do that under the pressure of a high-profile leak investigation.'b'BERLIN \xe2\x80\x94 I am a patriot. Being German, those words don\xe2\x80\x99t come easily, particularly for a leftish, skeptical urbanite like myself. And particularly not now, just a few days before we commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. But yes, I love my country.'b'The reason I say it out loud, now, is that I feel I have to defend Germany against those on the streets of Dresden who also call themselves \xe2\x80\x9cpatriots\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cPatriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West,\xe2\x80\x9d to be precise, which is the name of a loose alliance that brings thousands to the streets every Monday. Since the terror attacks in Paris, the movement has grown: The police counted 25,000 demonstrators on Jan. 12, the Monday after the attacks, a 7,500 jump from the week before. (It canceled its Jan. 19 protest over security concerns.)'b'Known by its German acronym, Pegida, the group has inflicted great harm on the country\xe2\x80\x99s international reputation. Our neighbors and allies are asking whether Germany is stumbling back into the darkness of xenophobia, and rightfully so. Many Germans are asking the same question these days.'b'There are two ways to look at the situation. The optimistic take is to note that, for all the attention Pegida gets inside of Germany and abroad, Germany has never been as liberal, culturally diverse and open toward minorities as it is today.'b'Last year a biennial poll conducted by the 'b'Friedrich Ebert Foundation'b', a foundation associated with the left-wing Social Democrats (and thus unlikely to underestimate the problem), found that anti-foreigner attitudes were at a historic low. While its 2012 poll found that about a quarter of Germans reported hostile views toward foreigners, only 7.5 percent did in 2014. And anti-Semitism, which is on the rise elsewhere in Europe, has dropped significantly, to 4.1 percent from 8.6.'b'Apart from the polls, there is quite a bit of evidence for a new openness. On Jan. 12, 100,000 people went to the streets nationwide in counterdemonstrations against Pegida, showing their solidarity with German Muslims. In Leipzig, 4,800 pro-Pegida protesters were met by 30,000 counterprotesters.'b'Meanwhile, all over Germany, private initiatives are popping up to help refugees. In Duisburg, a local politician has collected 100 bicycles for refugee children. In Zirndorf, doctors are providing refugees with free medication. Even in Dresden, Pegida\xe2\x80\x99s stronghold, groups are helping refugees with the hard tasks of getting settled, like providing translation services at appointments with authorities.'b'Still, the enormous support for Pegida requires us to consider another, darker reading of the situation, as evidence of troubling developments within German society.'b'One is the failure of mainstream politics. There is a tendency among the major parties to move toward the center of the political spectrum, creating an ideological void at its far right and left ends. The far right in particular has lacked political representation in the past years, which helps explain why a new populist party, Alternative f\xc3\xbcr Deutschland, had such enormous success in European and state elections last year. While leaders of the Alternative, as it\xe2\x80\x99s called, claim to be primarily anti-European Union, many have also expressed support for Pegida.'b'Another change revolves around the Internet. In this view, the Pegida people are just the usual frustrated lot looming at the edges of society. Now, emboldened by the reinforcement they find in like-minded communities online, they\xe2\x80\x99re taking to the streets.'b'And a third is the persistence of regional differences. Though Pegida has drawn support in western Germany, it is strongest in the former East Germany. In the East, xenophobic attitudes are still more common than in the West, for a complex mix of reasons, including higher unemployment rates, but also because of feelings of inferiority.'b'We also have to ask what Pegida says about Germany, whatever its causes. It certainly indicates that the relative social peace we are experiencing right now is fragile. But it also shows how the country, still new to the multiethnic game, is struggling with its identity. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the 1950s that the first waves of immigrants arrived, the \xe2\x80\x9cGastarbeiter\xe2\x80\x9d (guest workers) from Turkey and Italy who came to fill the labor gap in the country\xe2\x80\x99s prospering postwar economy.'b'For decades, Germany was able to pretend that the guest workers were just that, guests. But the third generation of Turkish immigrants is now reaching adulthood. At the same time, immigration numbers are rising: Germany\xe2\x80\x99s immigrant population grew by about 430,000 last year. Many came from the Southern European countries that still suffer from the euro crisis, but last year Germany also welcomed some 220,000 refugees, mostly from Syria, Eritrea, Serbia and Afghanistan.'b'The white face of German society is changing at a rapid pace. In this context, the Pegida protests are getting such attention because they act as a weekly checkup of German society. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if every Monday, the news media are putting a trembling hand to the country\xe2\x80\x99s forehead, checking its temperature, wondering whether our ugly, xenophobic past is taking over again. And we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to look back to the 1930s to find that past; in the early 1990s, when the country last saw similar numbers of refugees, an irrational fear of foreigners taking the jobs of \xe2\x80\x9creal Germans\xe2\x80\x9d gripped the country, culminating in anti-immigrant riots in several cities, with several deaths, many wounded and thousands scared.'b'Last week, a 20-year-old refugee from Eritrea was found stabbed to death near his apartment in Dresden. Neighbors reported that swastikas had been painted onto the door of his apartment. Germans held their breath. Was this a neo-Nazi murder? Was there a connection to the Pegida rallies? Then, on Thursday, authorities arrested one of the victim\xe2\x80\x99s roommates, another asylum seeker, who they say has admitted to the attack. Still, we don\xe2\x80\x99t trust ourselves. Why should our neighbors? Why should you?'b'However the investigation turns out, I am an optimist, believing that we will not see history repeated. Germany has come a long way since even the early \xe2\x80\x9990s. And rather than causing violence, Pegida has set off a public debate on Germany\xe2\x80\x99s national identity. This is long overdue. Prominent conservative politicians like Peter Tauber, the secretary general of the Christian Democratic Party, have demanded a new, clearer framework for immigration. Last week, Chancellor Angela Merkel declared that \xe2\x80\x9cIslam is part of Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d It was an assessment, rather than an ideological statement. It was the simple acknowledgment of a simple reality.'b'On Jan. 10, a protester holding a sign \xe2\x80\x9cI am Charlie\xe2\x80\x9d was arrested in Moscow and later sentenced to eight days in jail. A few days later, the federal media watchdog ordered the St. Petersburg edition of the Business News Agency to remove the new cover of Charlie Hebdo from its website. The same agency was warned that reprinting the cartoon depicting the Prophet Muhammad could be considered a criminal offense, and that it would violate the \xe2\x80\x9cethical and moral norms formed in Russia through the centuries of different peoples and faiths living side by side.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Monday, Ramzan A. Kadyrov, whom Vladimir V. Putin appointed president of Chechnya in 2007, held a mass rally in Grozny, the regional capital, against \xe2\x80\x9cthe enemies of Islam.\xe2\x80\x9d It was reportedly attended by tens of thousands of people, many of them sporting slogans that read \xe2\x80\x9cWe love Muhammad,\xe2\x80\x9d in Russian, Arabic and English. The largest banner quoted Mr. Putin: \xe2\x80\x9cIslam is a vital part of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s cultural makeup.\xe2\x80\x9d In his speech, Mr. Kadyrov pledged to defend Russia and denounced Western journalists and politicians.'b'To a certain extent, the rally shows how adept \xe2\x80\x94 at least so far \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Putin has been at mixing religion and politics. It is well known that he relies heavily on the Russian Orthodox Church to bolster his support whenever he needs to draw public attention away from his country\xe2\x80\x99s troubling economic and social ills. But Russia also has a large Muslim population \xe2\x80\x94 nearly one-sixth of its people are Muslim. Moscow alone has two million Muslim residents, and according to some estimates, an equal number of Muslim migrant workers. Mr. Putin wants to keep them in his camp, and this requires pragmatism and the utmost delicacy. The brutal war in Chechnya may have ended, but Islamist rebels, some of them professing loyalty to the Islamic State, still roam the Caucasus, and Moscow is fearful that their influence can easily spread northward.'b'Though the Kremlin was quick to express solidarity with France and condemn terrorism in the aftermath of the Paris attack, the pro-government media placed equal blame at the feet of the Charlie Hebdo journalists for their provocative cartoons, and at the Western liberalism that allows such publications.'b'Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s Russia is not a friendly place for irreverent humor. Early in his presidency the Kremlin banned the widely popular satirical television show \xe2\x80\x9cKukly,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cDolls,\xe2\x80\x9d which mercilessly mocked Russian politicians. In 2012, several members of the punk group Pussy Riot were sent to prison for their protest in Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s largest cathedral. In 2013, the Duma adopted a law that criminalized insulting one\xe2\x80\x99s religious sensibilities.'b'Behind the purported wish to protect the feelings of the faithful lies a pragmatic attempt to maintain the support of conservative Christian, Muslim and Nationalist groups, and to keep Islamic extremists at bay. After all, Russia has been the target of numerous attacks by Chechen and other terrorist groups from the North Caucasus. Neither military actions nor economic policies in the 15 years since Mr. Putin came to power have succeeded in completely stamping out insurgency in that restless Islamic land. Russian media reports indicate that attacks on police and government officials are still common.'b'When Mr. Kadyrov assumed power in Chechnya, the war-ravaged region lay in ruins. Using ruthless methods, he suppressed any opposition, whether from Islamists, other political rivals, or human rights advocates. Counterterrorism operations were formally declared over in 2009. With massive Kremlin aid, he rebuilt Chechnya.'b'Mr. Kadyrov has proven a fierce Putin loyalist, bragging of his readiness to send Chechen \xe2\x80\x9cvolunteers\xe2\x80\x9d wherever the Russian president needs them. Several hundred have been fighting on the side of the rebels in eastern Ukraine, and Mr. Kadyrov recently offered to dispatch more.'b'But the price of peace and order has been the emergence of an Islamic state within Russia. Chechnya\xe2\x80\x99s nominally secular institutions are now thoroughly Islamicized. Public schools have instructors who teach Islam. Each district administration has a qadi, or Islamic judge, who wields de facto power in the district. Shariah courts function in the guise of state courts. Women are ordered to keep covered in public places, and the consumption of alcohol is prohibited. During his \xe2\x80\x9cvirtue campaign,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kadyrov openly declared that a woman is a man\xe2\x80\x99s property and defended \xe2\x80\x9chonor killings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tellingly, Mr. Kadyrov never condemned the massacre at Charlie Hebdo. Instead he denounced the publication\xe2\x80\x99s cover as a provocation against Muslims and declared that anyone who supported Charlie Hebdo was his enemy \xe2\x80\x94 apparently no idle threat from a man who is widely believed to be behind the assassinations of many of his opponents.'b'Despite his vigorous protestations of loyalty to Moscow, it is not clear how comfortable the Kremlin is with such shows of force like the rally on Monday. At one point, Mr. Kadyrov boasted that he could easily get a million Muslims to protest on the streets of Moscow. According to Russian news reports, Muslim leaders had planned to hold a demonstration in Moscow on Sunday, but city officials denied permission for the rally, citing security concerns.'b'It is also telling that the pro-government media\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of the rally in Chechnya on Monday was light. This could have been because the demonstration coincided with celebrations of the Epiphany in Russian Orthodox tradition. But it is also likely that the Kremlin is increasingly concerned with losing control of a man whose job was to bring Chechnya into Russia\xe2\x80\x99s fold and who instead created an Islamic state within the Russian Federation.'b'Mr. Kadyrov, a member of the council of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ruling United Russia party and a decorated Hero of the Russian Federation, admitted several years ago that, for him, Shariah was above any other law. For the moment, President Putin seems to find Shariah more palatable than freedom of speech.'b''b' 'b'Michael Khodarkovsky'b' is a professor of history at Loyola University Chicago and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cBitter Choices: Loyalty and Betrayal in the Russian Conquest of the North Caucasus.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'As astonishing as it was to see Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the New York Assembly, surrender to the F.B.I. on corruption charges Thursday morning, it is even more incredible that he can choose to go on serving in his job while he defends himself against bribery and kickback charges involving millions of dollars.'b'In New York\xe2\x80\x99s sleazy political world, where fairly obvious corruption is not just tolerated but encouraged by ethics laws that barely deserve the name, Mr. Silver does not have to relinquish his power even temporarily. That, in fact, is something he should have done two years ago after the disclosure of his role in silencing a sexual harassment complaint against another lawmaker.'b'Mr. Silver told reporters at the federal courthouse, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I\xe2\x80\x99ll be vindicated,\xe2\x80\x9d and his lawyers called the charges \xe2\x80\x9cmeritless.\xe2\x80\x9d He will have a chance to defend himself in this case. But the system that allows New York lawmakers to engorge their bank accounts in ways that are at best dubious and at worst corrupt deserves no defense, and Mr. Silver is not just part of it. He leads it.'b'The five-count complaint accuses the powerful Mr. Silver of receiving bribes and kickbacks masked as legitimate income earned as a private lawyer. The charges include mail fraud as part of a scheme to refer clients with state business secretly to law firms that then paid Mr. Silver in substantial referral fees. In some cases, Mr. Silver then rewarded these clients with tax breaks, legislative benefits or even state funds he controlled as Assembly speaker, the complaint charges.'b'In one circular scheme that enriched all parties, Mr. Silver, federal investigators say, convinced a physician to refer asbestos cases to him at his law firm, Weitz &amp; Luxenberg. The law firm then paid Mr. Silver for his referral services, and Mr. Silver directed $500,000 from a secret $8.5 million slush fund to the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s research facility. (The doctor is not named in the complaint and has agreed to testify for the prosecutors.) Mr. Silver\xe2\x80\x99s total income reported from Weitz &amp; Luxenberg is more than $650,000 a year, at least according to what he has disclosed. That\xe2\x80\x99s on top of his government salary of $121,000, which alone is more than most Americans make.'b'Mr. Silver is also facing charges of failing to report what could be a substantial amount of income from a small real estate firm. His undisclosed income reportedly came from legal cases involving exemptions to real estate taxes \xe2\x80\x94 an area beyond Mr. Silver\xe2\x80\x99s legal expertise but within his sphere of influence in Albany. In a press briefing Thursday afternoon, United States Attorney Preet Bharara accused Mr. Silver of using his \xe2\x80\x9ctitanic political power\xe2\x80\x9d to pocket these millions and hide the money in six different banks. At this time, the courts have seized $3.8 million of Mr. Silver\xe2\x80\x99s assets, he said.'b'The investigation of Mr. Silver by Mr. Bharara was strengthened by files collected by the anticorruption Moreland Commission in Albany, which deserves credit for not sparing such a powerful political figure. Gov. Andrew Cuomo created the commission with great fanfare and then abruptly shut it down last year to get a budget deal approved by legislators.'b'Mr. Silver was among those who fought subpoenas from the commission demanding a list of clients and descriptions of services provided for pay, according to the indictment. Within two weeks after Mr. Cuomo shut down the commission, Mr. Bharara took control over its files and unfinished investigations. The case against Mr. Silver could be the first of several against Albany lawmakers. Or as Mr. Bharara hinted on Thursday, \xe2\x80\x9cStay tuned.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This dramatic turn of events could be the start of a wholesale cleanup of Albany\xe2\x80\x99s appalling political culture, something voters have wished for and deserved for many years. But it\xe2\x80\x99s only a start.'b'OUR modern criminal justice system is designed to avoid jury trials. Through investigation and considered use of discretion, prosecutors are expected to charge only when there is sufficient evidence to convict. Once charged, defendants are encouraged to plead guilty in part to avoid a \xe2\x80\x9ctrial penalty\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a longer sentence after a trial, often a much longer one. And 95 percent of them do just that. The Supreme Court acknowledged this reality in 2012 when it described our criminal process as \xe2\x80\x9ca system of pleas.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Serial'b',\xe2\x80\x9d the hit podcast about Adnan Syed\xe2\x80\x99s 2000 conviction for strangling his former high school girlfriend, Hae Min Lee, focuses on the question of whether Mr. Syed was unjustly convicted. Found guilty of first-degree murder and kidnapping after a five-week trial and two hours of jury deliberation, Mr. Syed is now serving a sentence of life plus 30 years. If he is innocent, this outcome is indeed a tragedy.'b'But if he is guilty, the result is also troubling. The average sentence for individuals convicted of murder that year in the United States was 19 years. Had Mr. Syed, then 18, plea-bargained in what his prosecutor recently described as a \xe2\x80\x9crun-of-the-mill domestic violence murder,\xe2\x80\x9d he might have been able to earn his freedom by age 40.'b'It is noteworthy that a court is currently considering whether Mr. Syed\xe2\x80\x99s counsel gave him substandard legal assistance when she failed to explore the option of a guilty plea. Mr. Syed claims that he twice asked his lawyer to seek an offer from the prosecutor, but she told him none was forthcoming. The prosecutor states that she made no such request. Mr. Syed\xe2\x80\x99s attorney died in 2004, three years after being disbarred, before she could address this claim.'b'In this case, the injustice may lie not in the conviction, but in the failure to negotiate the charges. The unstructured presentation of the facts in \xe2\x80\x9cSerial\xe2\x80\x9d obscured a strong case for the prosecution. A former classmate who was cross-examined for five days testified that Mr. Syed confessed to the killing, as he enlisted his help in burying the body. On the evening of Ms. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance, Mr. Syed\xe2\x80\x99s cellphone pinged cell towers near the burial site. A bargaining effort should have been undertaken here.'b'First-degree murder under Maryland law, for a case like Mr. Syed\xe2\x80\x99s, requires that a killing be premeditated or the result of the commission of a felony. The prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s theory was that Mr. Syed strangled Ms. Lee in a 21-minute car-ride after school. Strangulation, however, is not typically associated with premeditation, and the robbery, kidnapping and false imprisonment charges Mr. Syed also faced appear strained. The former classmate\xe2\x80\x99s reliability was compromised, and the cellphone evidence was open to interpretation.'b'In addition, there was the mitigating factor of Mr. Syed\xe2\x80\x99s age at the time of the crime. Seventeen is an age of increased inclination to take risks and limited impulse control. Age, as the juvenile justice scholar Barry Feld notes, also impairs a youth\xe2\x80\x99s competence to make good legal decisions and participate effectively in legal proceedings. Mr. Syed needed some serious adult guidance on how to deal with the fallout of his situation.'b'But there is little that is systematic in our plea-bargaining processes despite the fact that they fuel our criminal justice system. Plea bargaining is usually informal and unrecorded \xe2\x80\x94 sometimes simply fleeting conversations in courtroom corridors. In many jurisdictions, judges are expressly prohibited from participating in it. Attorneys for defendants plea-bargain most cases early and aggressively. But not always, and financial incentives for lawyers may lead them to do otherwise. A study conducted by the behavioral scientist James Anderson and the economist Paul Heaton in The Yale Law Journal revealed disturbing disparities in the outcomes of murder cases in Philadelphia: Public defenders achieved significantly better outcomes with fewer trials than their private court-appointed counterparts, who were paid more if the case went to trial.'b'A New York federal judge, Jed Rakoff, has proposed one reform: plea-bargaining conferences. In sealed proceedings, judges would examine each party\xe2\x80\x99s position and recommend a nonbinding plea bargain. The plan needs to be refined so it allows a defendant to opt out if he publicly acknowledges he understands what he is giving up. The proposal, however, provides a layer of review to protect the innocent from being pressured into pleading guilty, while potentially encouraging fairer plea bargains through the oversight of a neutral party. It creates a record of plea-bargaining efforts, so there can be no uncertainty as to whether an offer was requested or ignored. Finally, it might help guilty people make a more informed choice about how to resolve their cases.'b'In an ideal world, the primacy of the jury trial should be reinstated. Prosecute fewer people, incarcerate less often, remove the trial penalty by repealing mandatory sentencing regimes. Until then, however, we have an obligation to bring transparency and independent review to the plea-bargaining processes that decide, for the most part, who ends up in our prisons, and for how long.'b'As the world contemplates the deflated football scandal in Boston \xe2\x80\x94 'b'ballghazi 'b'\xe2\x80\x94 please allow me one last moment of undiluted sports delirium. I live in Seattle, where this week the sky is always blue, trees are blossoming early, all children are not only above average but get into the college of their choice, free. We are a city transfixed, rhapsodically floating, after the most are-you-kidding-me experience my hometown has ever been through.'b'To recap: With a little more than three minutes to go in last Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s N.F.C. championship game, the Seattle Seahawks were trailing Green Bay 19 to 7. At that point, 'b'according to the odds crunchers'b', the team had a 1 percent chance of winning \xe2\x80\x94 1 percent! The Seahawks promptly scored two touchdowns in 44 seconds. They recovered an onside kick, converted a two-point Hail Mary, won the coin toss to get the ball first in overtime, and scored to put them in the Super Bowl.'b'Sports metaphors crowd the language of politics, usually for the worse. John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s pick of an uninformed demagogue, Sarah Palin, was supposed to be a \xe2\x80\x9cgame changer.\xe2\x80\x9d Desperate campaigns look for a \xe2\x80\x9cknockout punch,\xe2\x80\x9d or make a \xe2\x80\x9cswing for the fences.\xe2\x80\x9d My favorite is President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s description of Joe Biden\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of gay marriage ahead of his boss \xe2\x80\x94 he \xe2\x80\x9cgot out a little bit over his skis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But back to the miracle finish last Sunday, and the lesson beyond pro football: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about the miracle, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the finish. Obama has been sleepwalking through the middle part of his presidency. The brutal midterm electoral crushing, with Republicans gaining their largest House majority since Herbert Hoover, slapped him from his stupor.'b'No longer does he care about pleasing the insiders, or playing nice with the opposition, or conforming to the expectations of a lame duck. He said it\xe2\x80\x99s the fourth quarter of his presidency, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m going to play offense.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s decided to be Russell Wilson after throwing four interceptions.'b'Many have written him off.

Just 5 percent of his 2013 proposals became law \xe2\x80\x94 and that was before Republicans gained the Senate.'b'The president\xe2\x80\x99s proposals \xe2\x80\x9care so out of touch you have to ask if there\xe2\x80\x99s any point to the speech,\xe2\x80\x9d said Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.'b'But if you look beyond capital gasbags, and consider the big ideas in Obama\xe2\x80\x99s speech, you can see the inevitability of his philosophy. His proposals \xe2\x80\x94 raising the minimum wage, paid maternity leave, making college more affordable and the tax system more fair \xe2\x80\x94 are popular across the political divide. They\xe2\x80\x99re mainstream anywhere but the fund-raisers that Reince Priebus presides over.'b'Obama has already changed health care in a country that lags far behind the rest of the world in access. He\xe2\x80\x99s overseen an economic recovery that defied all the apocalyptic predictions of his enemies, and would be the envy of any European country \xe2\x80\x94 let alone one governed by Mitt Romney, who\xe2\x80\x99d be taking a victory lap with the kind of numbers Obama has generated on his watch.'b'Consider Idaho, arguably the reddest state in the union, where Republicans control everything but a handful of latte stands. After much bluster and protest, Idaho politicians caved and set up a state health care exchange under Obamacare. To the surprise of the experts, Idahoans have embraced the private coverage available under the Affordable Care Act \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most successful enrollments of any state,\xe2\x80\x9d as Kaiser Health News reported.'b'Obama was in Boise on Wednesday, speaking to a crowd of more than 6,000 people at an event where all tickets were gone within an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cNow there are 10 black people in Idaho,\xe2\x80\x9d was one of the tweets from Boise.

He was quoting from a Minneapolis woman, invited to the speech, but it sounded like a motto for his last two years in office.'b'The president is playing for a legacy. He won\xe2\x80\x99t get much of it this year, or even next.

New York is currently one of only two states whose criminal justice system tries all 16- and 17-year-olds as adults. This practice is harmful, expensive and ineffective.'b'The treatment of juveniles as adults disrupts communities and tears families apart without any demonstrable benefit to our public safety. Multiple studies have shown that prosecuting and punishing juveniles as adults greatly enhances the likelihood that they will reoffend in the future \xe2\x80\x94 even when they would otherwise be at very low risk of recidivism.'b'This policy change, 'b'proposed by the New York Commission on Youth, Public Safety and Justice'b', and highlighted by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in his State of the State address, is long overdue. As New York\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, I will continue to work toward building and operating a criminal justice system that not only treats New Yorkers more fairly, but makes them safer, too.'b'ERIC T.

The hidden health and environmental costs associated with incinerator pollution mean that it is not a cheaper option than recycling. Curbside recycling and composting do not generate these same costs because they are cleaner, safer options.'b'Incineration is also an environmental justice issue. Low-income and minority communities are disproportionately burdened by these environmental hazards. Detroit, a largely African-American and Latino community, is home to one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest incinerators. The facility\xe2\x80\x99s emissions contribute to Detroit\xe2\x80\x99s poor air quality and high asthma death rates, about twice the state average.

Asking it to spend $300,000 to ensure our safety is hardly burdensome.'b'There is not sufficient evidence to conclude that e-cigarettes are a safer alternative to regular cigarettes or that e-cigarettes actually help smokers quit. In fact, some evidence shows that e-cigarettes may serve as a gateway to use of tobacco in young people, and that by allowing their use in locations where other smoking is prohibited, they may actually prolong addiction to tobacco.'b'Finally, it is too early to suggest labeling saying \xe2\x80\x9cit is likely that e-cigarettes ... are much safer than smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d That isn\xe2\x80\x99t reassurance; it\xe2\x80\x99s a marketing tactic.

When men rated the women, the median score was about 3 and the ratings followed a bell curve \xe2\x80\x94 a few really attractive women and an equal number of women rated as unattractive.'b'But when women rated men, the results were quite different. The median score was between 1 and 2. Only 1 in 6 of the guys was rated as having above average looks. Either the guys who go to places like OkCupid, Tinder and other sites are disproportionately homely, or women have unforgiving eyes.'b'Looks, unsurprisingly, dominate online dating. But I learned some details from \xe2\x80\x9cDataclysm,\xe2\x80\x9d the book by Christian Rudder, who is the co-founder and president of OkCupid.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a gigantic superstar effect. Women who are rated in the top 5 percent of attractiveness get a vast majority of the approaches. The bottom 95 percent get much less. For men, looks barely matter at all unless you are in the top 3 percent or so. The hunks get barraged with approaches.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s better to have a polarizing profile than a bland one. People who generate high levels of disapproval \xe2\x80\x94 because they look like goths or bikers or just weird \xe2\x80\x94 often also generate higher levels of enthusiasm.'b'Racial bias is prevalent. When Asian men are looking at Asian women they rate them as 18 percent more attractive than average. But when they are looking at black women, they rate them as 27 percent less attractive. White and Latino men downgrade black women by nearly the same percentage. White, Latino and Asian women have similar preferences.'b'When people start texting or tweeting to each other, they don\xe2\x80\x99t turn into a bunch of Einsteins. Rudder looked into the most common words and phrases used on Twitter. For men they include: good bro, ps4, my beard, in nba, hoopin and off-season. For women they include: my nails done, mani pedi, retail therapy, and my belly button.'b'People who date online are not shallower or vainer than those who don\xe2\x80\x99t. Research suggests they are broadly representative. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that they\xe2\x80\x99re in a specific mental state. They\xe2\x80\x99re shopping for human beings, commodifying people. They have access to very little information that can help them judge if they will fall in love with this person. They pay ridiculous amounts of attention to things like looks, which have little bearing on whether a relationship will work. OkCupid took down the pictures one day. The people who interacted on this day exchanged contact info at twice the rate as on a regular day.'b'The dating sites have taken the information available online and tried to use it to match up specific individuals. They\xe2\x80\x99ve failed. An exhaustive review of the literature by Eli J. Finkel of Northwestern and others concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cNo compelling evidence supports matching sites\xe2\x80\x99 claims that mathematical algorithms work.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s because what creates a relationship can\xe2\x80\x99t be expressed in data or photographs. Being in love can\xe2\x80\x99t be done by a person in a self-oriented mind-set, asking: Does this choice serve me? Online dating is fascinating because it is more or less the opposite of its object: love.'b'When online daters actually meet, an entirely different mind-set has to kick in. If they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be open to a real relationship, they have to stop asking where this person rates in comparison to others and start asking, can we lower the boundaries between self and self. They have to stop thinking in individual terms and start feeling in rapport terms.'b'Basically, they have to take the enchantment leap. This is when something dry and utilitarian erupts into something passionate, inescapable and devotional. Sometimes a student becomes enraptured by the beauty of math, and becomes a mathematician. Soldiers doing the drudgery of boot camp are gradually bonded into a passionate unit, for which they will risk their lives. Anybody who has started a mere job and found in it a vocation has taken the enchantment leap.'b'In love, of course, the shift starts with vulnerability, not calculation. The people involved move from selfishness to service, from prudent thinking to poetic thinking, from a state of selection to a state of need, from relying on conscious thinking to relying on their own brilliant emotions.'b'When you look at all the people looking for love and vocation today, you realize we live in a culture and an online world that encourages a very different mind-set; in a technical culture in which humanism, religion and the humanities, which are the great instructors of enchantment, are not automatically central to life.'b'I have to guess some cultures are more fertile for enchantment \xe2\x80\x94 that some activities, like novel-reading or music-making, cultivate a skill for it, and that building a capacity for enchantment is, these days, a countercultural act and a practical and fervent need.'b'The United States and Europe have a lot in common. Both are multicultural and democratic; both are immensely wealthy; both possess currencies with global reach. Both, unfortunately, experienced giant housing and credit bubbles between 2000 and 2007, and suffered painful slumps when the bubbles burst.'b'Since then, however, policy on the two sides of the Atlantic has diverged. In one great economy, officials have shown a stern commitment to fiscal and monetary virtue, making strenuous efforts to balance budgets while remaining vigilant against inflation. In the other, not so much.'b'And the difference in attitudes is the main reason the two economies are now on such different paths. Spendthrift, loose-money America is experiencing a solid recovery \xe2\x80\x94 a reality reflected in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s feisty State of the Union address. Meanwhile, virtuous Europe is sinking ever deeper into deflationary quicksand; everyone hopes that 'b'the new monetary measures announced Thursday'b' will break the downward spiral, but nobody I know really expects them to be enough.'b'On the U.S. economy: No, it\xe2\x80\x99s not morning in America, let alone the kind of prosperity we managed during the Clinton years. Recovery could and should have come much faster, and family incomes remain well below their pre-crisis level. Although you\xe2\x80\x99d never know it from the public discussion, 'b'there\xe2\x80\x99s overwhelming agreement among economists'b' that the Obama stimulus of 2009-10 helped limit the damage from the financial crisis, but it was too small and faded away far too fast. Still, when you compare the performance of the American economy over the past two years with 'b'all those Republican predictions of doom'b', you can see why Mr. Obama is strutting a bit.'b'Europe, on the other hand \xe2\x80\x94 or more precisely the eurozone, the 18 countries sharing a common currency \xe2\x80\x94 'b'did almost everything wrong'b'. On the fiscal side, Europe never did much stimulus, and quickly turned to austerity \xe2\x80\x94 spending cuts and, to a lesser extent, tax increases \xe2\x80\x94 despite high unemployment. On the monetary side, officials fought the imaginary menace of inflation, and took years to acknowledge that the real threat is deflation.'b'Why did they get it so wrong?'b'To some extent, the turn toward austerity reflected institutional weakness: In the United States, federal programs like Social Security, Medicare and food stamps helped support states like Florida with especially severe housing busts, whereas European nations in similar straits, like Spain, were on their own. But European austerity also reflected willful misdiagnosis of the situation. In Europe as in America, the excesses that led to crisis overwhelmingly involved private rather than public debt, with Greece very much an outlier. But officials in Berlin and Brussels chose to ignore the evidence in favor of a narrative that placed all the blame on budget deficits, and simultaneously 'b'rejected the evidence'b' suggesting \xe2\x80\x94 correctly \xe2\x80\x94 that trying to slash deficits in a depressed economy would deepen the depression.'b'Meanwhile, Europe\xe2\x80\x99s central bankers decided to worry about inflation in 2011 and raise interest rates. Even at the time it was obvious that this was foolish \xe2\x80\x94 yes, there had been an uptick in headline inflation, but measures of underlying inflation were too low, not too high.'b'Monetary policy got much better after Mario Draghi became president of the European Central Bank in late 2011. Indeed, Mr. Draghi\xe2\x80\x99s heroic efforts to provide liquidity to nations facing speculative attack almost surely saved the euro from collapse. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all clear that he has the tools to fight off the broader deflationary forces set in motion by years of wrongheaded policy. Furthermore, he has to function with one hand tied behind his back, because Germany remains adamantly opposed to anything that might make life easier for debtor nations.'b'The terrible thing is that Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economy was wrecked in the name of responsibility. True, there have been times when being tough meant reducing deficits and resisting the temptation to print money. In a depressed economy, however, a balanced-budget fetish and a hard-money obsession are deeply irresponsible. Not only do they hurt the economy in the short run, they can \xe2\x80\x94 and in Europe, have \xe2\x80\x94 inflict long-run harm, damaging the economy\xe2\x80\x99s potential and driving it into a deflationary trap that\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to escape.'b'Nor was this an innocent mistake. The thing that strikes me about Europe\xe2\x80\x99s archons of austerity, its doyens of deflation, is their self-indulgence. They felt comfortable, emotionally and politically, demanding sacrifice (from other people) at a time when the world needed more spending. They were all too eager to ignore the evidence that they were wrong.'b'And Europe will be paying the price for their self-indulgence for years, perhaps decades, to come.'b'The modern American death penalty is beset with endless complications and contradictions, and over the years no state has embodied the full range of these as consistently as Georgia.'b'Death sentences handed down by Georgia provided the basis for both the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1972 'b'moratorium'b' on capital punishment and its 'b'lifting'b' of that moratorium four years later. In 1987, the court 'b'upheld'b' another Georgia death sentence \xe2\x80\x94 of a black man convicted of murdering a white police officer \xe2\x80\x94 despite 'b'statistical evidence'b' showing that the death penalty there was applied far more often when the victim was white rather than black.'b'Now Georgia is in the spotlight again, as it 'b'prepares to execute'b' Warren Lee Hill Jr. Mr. Hill was serving a life sentence for killing his girlfriend when he was convicted of the murder of a fellow inmate in 1991. He is scheduled to be put to death by lethal injection on Jan. 27.'b'Mr. Hill was scheduled to die in 'b'2012'b' and 'b'2013'b', but both times his execution was stayed. In 2013, a state judge 'b'stopped it'b' because of constitutional concerns over a new law making the source and composition of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s lethal-injection drugs a state secret. Mr. Hill has long claimed he is intellectually disabled, with an average I.Q. score of 70. Seven mental health experts have all agreed with him. Three of them, all hired by the state, originally testified that he was competent, but later recanted.'b'This alone should make Mr. Hill ineligible for the death penalty under a 'b'2002 decision'b' by the Supreme Court, which barred the execution of those with intellectual disabilities.'b'But the court left it to states to decide who was intellectually disabled, and Georgia has essentially circumvented that principle by requiring defendants to prove intellectual disability beyond a reasonable doubt \xe2\x80\x94 an absurdly difficult standard to meet. Only one capital defendant in Georgia has ever satisfied the test.'b'The Georgia standard has survived until now, but perhaps it will not survive much longer. Last year, the Supreme Court struck down a similarly rigid and unscientific law in Florida that made it nearly impossible for defendants to prove an intellectual disability. \xe2\x80\x9cThe States are laboratories for experimentation,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Anthony Kennedy 'b'wrote for the court'b' in Hall v. Florida, \xe2\x80\x9cbut those experiments may not deny the basic dignity the Constitution protects.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So far, nothing has changed for Mr. Hill. On Jan. 20 the Georgia Supreme Court 'b'denied his request'b' for a stay in light of the ruling in the Florida case; he has appealed that decision to the United States Supreme Court. He faces a final clemency hearing on Monday.'b'Mr. Hill\xe2\x80\x99s case is a catalog of everything that is wrong with the death penalty. It also provides the Supreme Court with an opportunity to give meaning to the logic of its decisions.'b'What does the attack on Charlie Hebdo mean for free speech in the media?'b'There are two main schools of thought about the sudden resignation on Thursday of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi of Yemen and his cabinet.'b'Mr. Hadi, a weak statesman who has been a staunch ally in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s battle against Al Qaeda and other Sunni extremists, may have decided to cede control, feeling he was outgunned by the Houthis, the Shiite rebels who took up arms against the government after years of political grievances. Or he might have announced he was stepping down, expecting that the Houthis would be willing to strike a deal because they may not be interested in governing one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most impoverished and combustible nations.'b'On Wednesday, Mr. Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s government was reported to have struck a power-sharing agreement with the Houthis, who are currently in control of the capital. It is not clear why it unraveled.'b'The United States and Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s neighboring countries must nudge the antagonists in this crisis toward a compromise that avoids the wholesale collapse of the state. The implications of a complete unraveling of government institutions would be catastrophic.'b'Mr. Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s resignation followed weeks of tense negotiations with the Houthis, who have their strongholds in northern Yemen and receive significant support from Iran. Mr. Hadi, a major general in the Yemeni Army, came to power in 2012 as the sole candidate on the ballot, backed by the dominant party and the opposition. If the civilian government he led has in fact folded, the power void could lead to a deeper fragmentation of the country and a dramatic increase in violence. Under this scenario, it would become increasingly hard for the United States to continue battling the Yemeni affiliate of Al Qaeda, known as Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, and one of the most active and lethal wings of the terrorist network. The group, which is Sunni, took credit for the recent massacre at the office of a satirical magazine in Paris. It also has plotted several attacks on American targets.'b'A widening sectarian conflict in Yemen could more forcefully draw Saudi Arabia, the neighboring Sunni kingdom, and Shiite Iran into an unpredictable power struggle in which neither side would hold the upper hand. If the Houthis attempt to govern the majority-Sunni nation, the Qaeda affiliate would almost certainly gain more support.'b'While the Houthis have long professed animosity toward the United States, they have much to lose if the Qaeda group continues to make inroads, a prospect Washington and Mr. Hadi dread.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have overlapping interests with the Houthis,\xe2\x80\x9d said W. Andrew Terrill, a Middle East scholar at the United States Army War College who has studied Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s recent power struggles. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all probably more concerned about AQAP than Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s other problems.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The United States is not known to have a direct, open line of dialogue with the Houthis, but it would be in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s interest to start building a relationship, even through back channels. The tactics the Houthis have used to pressure Mr. Hadi, including surrounding his home and holding his chief of staff hostage, are deplorable. But some of their grievances about widespread corruption and poor governance are legitimate. And despite the group\xe2\x80\x99s stated hostility toward the United States and Israel, it does not appear intent on attacking Western targets.'b'Given some constructive international mediation, there\xe2\x80\x99s a chance Mr. Hadi and the Houthis could manage to steer the country away from a dangerous collapse. Facilitating that would probably require deft deal-making backed by Saudi Arabia, Iran and the United States.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Obama, who is visiting India this weekend, and India\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Narendra Modi, have both described their countries as natural partners. That may be true. But they cannot achieve a deep and strategic partnership until the United States deals more forthrightly with Pakistan, New Delhi\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor and nemesis.'b'In other words, Washington must do more to address India\xe2\x80\x99s anxieties about Pakistan. But there is a conundrum. Washington should also not harm its delicate and distrustful relationship with Islamabad.'b'Yes, Pakistan harbors jihadist groups that threaten and kill Americans. But it also sits astride the Middle East and Asia, boasts a large and young population, and enjoys deep friendships with China and Saudi Arabia. Diplomatic wisdom argues for staying on the good side of such a strategically significant state.'b'In effect, Washington needs to execute a delicate dance: Push back against Pakistan in order to further America\xe2\x80\x99s friendship with India, while taking care not to alienate the Pakistanis.'b'A neat trick? Perhaps. But it can be done.'b'First, America should stop giving free passes to the Pakistani military, which receives billions of dollars\xe2\x80\x99 worth of aid even as it sponsors militant groups that murder Indians. An American law requires that the government, before releasing security assistance, certify that Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces have acted to stop Pakistan-based militants, including anti-India groups. But in recent years, the Obama administration has invoked national security waivers that bypass the certification process. That should stop.'b'Insisting on certification would show India that the White House holds Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s military to some account. And Pakistan would probably pass. Last year it launched a counterterrorism offensive in North Waziristan, and this month it pledged to ban several militant groups operating on its soil; together, those actions would probably allow Pakistan to attain certification today, as it last did in 2011. Second, Washington should help India guard against Pakistan-based terrorism. It should go beyond placing bounties on top militant leaders, as it does now, but stop well short of staging raids into Pakistan to seize them for transfer to India. It should instead deepen its sharing of intelligence technology with New Delhi to forestall attacks. Encouragingly, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visit has been preceded by speculation about a deal involving surveillance drones.'b'Washington should also target overseas financial holdings of Pakistanis who threaten India. One of India\xe2\x80\x99s most wanted men, Dawood Ibrahim, is an organized crime boss frequently seen in Karachi. According to the United Nations, he funds the Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba, which attacked Mumbai in 2008. He is believed to hold assets in Dubai. Washington should work with officials in the Persian Gulf to freeze those assets.'b'Third, the United States should try to steer Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s short-term focus away from Kashmir and toward normalizing trade relations with India. Trade negotiations have progressed in recent years, and Mr. Modi advocates using commercial diplomacy to improve relations with neighbors. And India would be relieved to hear less about Kashmir, an issue that is nowhere near resolution.'b'Of course, it would be a tough sell for Washington to persuade Pakistan that the economic benefits of trade with India would far outweigh any benefit possible from dwelling on Kashmir. But there may be no better time to try, given the relatively relaxed current state of American-Pakistani relations. Still, any efforts to reassure India must be accompanied by nuanced American diplomacy, so as not to feed into the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica and the world are out to get us\xe2\x80\x9d narrative that permeates Pakistan.'b'The United States should acknowledge Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s neuroses about India \xe2\x80\x94 a nation perhaps seven times as populous and four times as large, with an army twice as big and governed by a Hindu nationalist party known for anti-Pakistan views. Americans should also take into account the Pakistani contention (rejected by New Delhi) that India engages in subversive activities in Pakistan (specifically, that it aids a separatist insurgency in Baluchistan province). Pakistanis have not forgotten India\xe2\x80\x99s support for the secession of East Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 now Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94 in 1971.'b'Of course, any American plan that intensifies support to India is likely to upset many Pakistanis, whose government has long demanded to be treated as India\xe2\x80\x99s equal. And any plan that aims not to offend Pakistan would have detractors in India.'b'Realistically, the United States is in no position to allay all of India\xe2\x80\x99s fears about Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly increasing nuclear weapons stockpile. It also can\xe2\x80\x99t end the Pakistani military-intelligence establishment\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on treating anti-India militants as useful proxies. And it won\xe2\x80\x99t succeed at coaxing Pakistan away from policies that are driven by its belief, whether manufactured or real, that India poses a direct threat. Washington should, however, press states that enjoy more leverage with Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 China, for example \xe2\x80\x94 to impress upon Islamabad the need to rethink its bellicose posture. China needs stability nearby, and its voice would resonate in Islamabad.'b'None of these potential limitations should deter Americans from trying this strategy. In fact, there are compelling reasons to push forward. With its combat troops out of Afghanistan, America can relax its fixation on pursuing deep relations with Pakistan, even while taking care not to spoil the relationship, and feel freer to engage India more. Its refocusing toward Asia, which envisions India as a counterbalance to China, should have a similar effect.'b'So helping New Delhi address its fears of Pakistan while engaging in damage control with Islamabad would be a logical and timely policy \xe2\x80\x94 a worthy goal for President Obama.'b'The story of the latest victim of censorship by intimidation in 'b'India'b', the Tamil-language author Perumal Murugan, was taken up by the Madras High Court on Tuesday. Earlier this month, Mr. Murugan posted a poignant statement on his Facebook page: \xe2\x80\x9cPerumal Murugan, the writer is dead.\xe2\x80\x9d This was after he had been hounded by right-wing Hindu groups, had met with local authorities and had agreed to withdraw copies of his novel from sale. The author\xe2\x80\x99s plight has provoked an outpouring of support from readers and writers in India.'b'Activists affiliated with the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and the Hindu right-wing group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh had called for the book to be banned because it offended them. Weeks of threatening phone calls to Mr. Murugan culminated in late December with a mob burning copies of the novel in the town where it is set.'b'The main source of the mob\xe2\x80\x99s ire were passages that evoke an ancient temple ritual that Mr. Murugan, who grew up in the area, does believe occurred in the past. It involves consensual sex between anonymous men and married women who had failed to conceive.'b'This is hardly the first time in India that groups expressing their outrage have acted as cultural vigilantes by trying to silence authors with threats. In 2012, an organizer of the Jaipur Literature Festival, William Dalrymple, was forced to cancel a planned program by video with the author Salman Rushdie \xe2\x80\x94 who had already canceled a personal appearance \xe2\x80\x94 after outraged Muslim activists threatened violence.'b'The Madras High Court has wisely asked the group that filed the Murugan case, the Tamil Nadu Progressive Writers and Artists Association, to broaden its petition to the larger issue of violent threats to freedom of expression. The court said: \xe2\x80\x9cOur largest concern is extrajudicial groups wielding power to decide what is right and what is not right, and asking authors what to write and what not to write.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is refreshing language from an Indian court on the issue of free speech.'b'Policy talk at the World Economic Forum.'b'Normally, the visit of a world leader to the United States would be arranged by the White House. But in a breach of sense and diplomacy, House Speaker John Boehner and Ron Dermer, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Washington, have taken it upon themselves to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel to Congress to challenge President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s approach to achieving a nuclear agreement with Iran.'b'Mr. Netanyahu, facing an election on March 17, apparently believes that winning the applause of Congress by rebuking Mr. Obama will bolster his standing as a leader capable of keeping Israel safe. Mr. Boehner seems determined to use whatever means is available to undermine and attack Mr. Obama on national security policy.'b'Lawmakers have every right to disagree with presidents; so do foreign leaders. But this event, to be staged in March a mile from the White House, is a hostile attempt to lobby Congress to enact more sanctions against Iran, a measure that Mr. Obama has rightly threatened to veto.'b'In his State of the Union address, Mr. Obama laid out an approach to international engagement that includes shrinking America\xe2\x80\x99s military commitments overseas and negotiating limits on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear activities in return for a gradual lifting of sanctions. A move by Congress to pass legislation proposing new sanctions could blow up the talks and divide the major powers that have been united in pressuring Iran. Given an excuse to withdraw from talks, Iran could accelerate its nuclear program, curbed for a year under an interim agreement, and force the United States or Israel to use military action or a cyberattack to keep Tehran from producing nuclear weapons.'b'In a recent Washington Post 'b'op-ed'b' article, the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and the European Union also implored Congress to hold off on new sanctions. Similar messages have come from scores of other experts, including two former American national security advisers, Brent Scowcroft, a Republican, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, a Democrat. According to Secretary of State 'b'John Kerry'b', even Mossad, the Israeli intelligence service, warned Congress that new sanctions would scuttle the talks, saying it would \xe2\x80\x9cbe like throwing a grenade into the process.\xe2\x80\x9d Mossad later tried to paper over any perceived differences with Mr. Netanyahu.'b'Mr. Netanyahu has long defined Iran as Israel\xe2\x80\x99s top threat and made clear his contempt for negotiations. Like his Congressional allies, however, he has never offered a real alternative, except more sanctions (which can\xe2\x80\x99t work if the rest of the world eases up on Iran) or military action. If a deal is finally reached and Congress finds it lacking, tougher sanctions can be imposed then.'b'Domestic politics are also at work. Republicans apparently see value in trying to sabotage any possible success for Mr. Obama, even if it harms American interests.'b'As for Mr. Netanyahu, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see how disrespecting an American president whom even he says has significantly advanced Israel\xe2\x80\x99s security can benefit his country.'b'There is no doubt that Mr. Obama will maintain America\xe2\x80\x99s security commitments to Israel, whatever the tensions over the Iran issue. But this event is bound to further harm a bilateral relationship that has endured a lot of battering over the past six years. The White House has said that, understandably, Mr. Obama will not meet with Mr. Netanyahu when he is in town. Even Mr. Kerry, who recently called almost 50 world leaders in an effort to block the Palestinians\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to join the International Criminal Court, is losing patience with Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s decision to \xe2\x80\x9cplay politics,\xe2\x80\x9d according to his aides. Can Mr. Netanyahu really afford to dismiss such allies?'b'DENVER \xe2\x80\x94 OVER the summer, I moved into a house in rural Nebraska where, for the first time ever, I had full control of the thermostat. It was a drafty 4,000-square-foot palace of cold-to-the touch cinder-blocks that had long stood empty. As fall approached, I started to think about heating. Keeping that whole place at 70 degrees with natural gas, for just one person, seemed like a waste. I wondered: How cold could I let my house get, while remaining comfortable?'b'Home temperatures appear to be slowly rising. The average nighttime bedroom in the United States is around 68 degrees, and the average living room is more than 70, according to a 2011 study on obesity and indoor temperatures. A study published that same year in the journal Building and Environment found that home heating and cooling were responsible for 9 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy consumption.'b'Reducing household energy use by lowering the thermostat would be a boon for the environment and our checking accounts. The agency forecasts that American households will pay an average of $621 for natural gas, $943 for electrical heating systems or $1,586 for heating oil this winter.'b'Winter weather arrived in mid-November, and soon the temperature was in the single digits. My house\xe2\x80\x99s thermostat had been preset to 55 degrees. Wearing a T-shirt, sweatshirt, sweatpants and a light coat, I found I was reasonably comfortable when I was under the covers or up and moving. But sitting at my computer, my hands were always half numb.'b'I remembered reading in Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voyage of the Beagle\xe2\x80\x9d about a tribe he encountered in Tierra del Fuego called the Yaghan, who wore few clothes and by all reports were comfortable, despite living in a region where the annual mean temperature is 42 degrees. If the Yaghan could do it scantily clothed, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t I do it well clothed? I did the obvious thing, and put on fingerless gloves and a hat. And after just a few days, a colder-than-normal house seemed, well, normal. I decided to go colder.'b'The lowest the thermostat would go was 45 degrees, which I figured was good because I had to make sure the pipes wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t freeze. At first it was fairly unpleasant. I wore two pairs of wool socks, thermal underwear, a thin pair of pants, sweatpants, a wool shirt, a sweatshirt, a light hoodie, a light jacket, a big poofy winter jacket, two winter hats and those fingerless gloves. Yet I was still having trouble typing because of my numb hands. That\xe2\x80\x99s when I pulled out my down sleeping bag, and decided to wear it whenever I was sitting. With the sleeping bag, now that my core had been warmed, my extremities were warming up, too.'b'Life at 45 degrees isn\xe2\x80\x99t for everyone \xe2\x80\x94 I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t recommend it for the sick, the elderly or children. And there are, of course, legitimate hazards to the cold. The National Weather Service reports that there were 66 cold- and winter-related deaths in 2013 in the United States. A more useful measurement, popular in Europe, is \xe2\x80\x9cexcess winter mortality,\xe2\x80\x9d which simply compares deaths during winter to those during the rest of the year. The resulting figures tend to be much higher than the weather service\xe2\x80\x99s: In England and Wales there were an estimated 31,100 such deaths in the 2012-13 winter.'b'Using this measure, paradoxically, warmer countries like Spain and Portugal suffer more cold-related deaths than colder countries, because they aren\xe2\x80\x99t as well versed in the art of keeping warm. The Siberian city of Yakutsk, the coldest city in the world, has an average temperature of minus 16 from October to March, yet experiences no excess winter deaths. Scandinavians, who also have a low excess winter mortality rate, have a common saying: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no bad weather, only bad clothing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say that I liked living in a 45-degree house, but eventually I didn\xe2\x80\x99t mind it, and it taught me that one\xe2\x80\x99s sense of comfort can be redefined with a bit of grit and resourcefulness. Sitting in my sleeping bag, I began to wonder: If we all set our thermostats to our own \xe2\x80\x9ccomfortable low,\xe2\x80\x9d how many West Virginia mountains could we save? How many fewer wells would need to be fracked? How much less greenhouse gas would we emit?'b'My experiment came to a halt when friends in Lincoln asked if I could watch their house and dogs for a few weeks. Their thermostat was set at 74 degrees, and I thought it would be inappropriate to fiddle with it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to lie: It was nice to be able to eat a bowl of cereal in my underwear. But part of me genuinely missed my cold, yet comfortable, house.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'We read \xe2\x80\x9c'b'After PTSD, More Trauma'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 18), by David J. Morris, a former Marine infantry officer, with concern. The Department of Veterans Affairs has long recognized access to care as a top priority for improving veteran services. Secretary Robert A. McDonald has challenged the V.A. to refocus and re-energize these efforts.'b'An increasingly broad range of effective treatment options are now available to veterans, but we fear that Mr. Morris\xe2\x80\x99s account will make some veterans reluctant to seek help for post-traumatic stress disorder.'b'Since 2006, the V.A. has trained over 6,000 clinicians in two of the most effective treatments for PTSD: prolonged exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy. Both treatments are strongly recommended in the practice guidelines of the Veterans Affairs and Defense Departments and in other PTSD guidelines around the world.'b'A 2013 study found that over 60 percent of veterans who received prolonged exposure therapy from the V.A. in the national training initiative experienced clinically meaningful improvement. Although feeling worse in therapy can happen, a standard V.A. protocol for prolonged exposure informs patients of this and the option to discontinue.'b'We are glad to hear that Mr. Morris was offered an alternative treatment that helped. The V.A. welcomes criticism but also needs constructive ideas to succeed. The V.A. is actively engaging community partners, academia, advocates, the private sector and, most important, veterans and their families, to improve services.

It didn\xe2\x80\x99t help. Those images are still with me.'b'I was finally brought by another Vietnam veteran to talk therapy at the local V.A. hospital. That helped me want to live, as I exchanged the horrors of combat with fellow veterans.'b'Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman was right: War is hell, and its glory is all moonshine.

RIGA'b' Houston, Jan. 20, 2015'b''b'\xc2\xa0'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'I applaud the courage of David J. Morris in sharing his compelling story of struggles with treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. Unfortunately, many veterans returning from long, emotionally challenging deployments have difficulty tolerating prolonged exposure therapy for treatment of PTSD. For some it is equivalent to retraumatization.'b'While prolonged exposure is widely regarded as a validated treatment for PTSD, its principal use has been for women after sexual trauma. Evidence of its effectiveness in male combat veterans \xe2\x80\x94 or men following any traumatic event \xe2\x80\x94 is weaker.'b'In retrospect, Mr. Morris might have been better served by a combination of medication and cognitive processing therapy. And for veterans who cannot initially tolerate jumping out of the fire of combat and into the frying pan of prolonged exposure, there are exercises in emotion regulation that can be taught first, to increase a person\xe2\x80\x99s ability to tolerate reminders of combat.'b'In addition, research in \xe2\x80\x9cpersonalized medicine\xe2\x80\x9d is needed to develop biomarker predictions for those veterans who will, and will not, be able to tolerate prolonged exposure. These studies will help clinicians move away from a one-size-fits-all approach and streamline the selection of the right treatment protocol for each veteran suffering from PTSD.'b'CHARLES R.

This requires years of training and expertise. Additionally, research indicates that eye movement desensitization and reprocessing is an effective treatment for PTSD.'b'Several years ago I attended a conference in Phoenix on this treatment. The keynote address was by a career naval psychologist who took the military and the V.A. to task for not training enough therapists in this proven modality.'b'In addition, veterans who have been asked to sacrifice so much deserve the best trained people to serve them, instead of a therapist who starts the process by asking for forgiveness for lack of training or expertise. It is shameful to ask so much of our veterans and to provide so little. The failure of Mr. Morris\xe2\x80\x99s treatment was predetermined.'b'HOWARD J.

The premise that the trauma needs to be relived over and over in order to heal has questionable scientific merit, because the brain areas that go offline during a traumatic experience and precipitate PTSD are once again deactivated when people are pressed to re-create the horrors of the past.'b'The challenge in treating PTSD is to help people feel fully alive in the present, and to help their brains, which have been rewired to be focused on threats, become fully engaged in the present.'b'Veterans must be helped not only to experience \xe2\x80\x9cthe sun setting through bands of liquid gold,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mr. Morris describes, but also to deal with conflicts with spouses, demanding bosses and rambunctious offspring.

Currently, they appear to have persuaded our attorney general that the amendment bars him from taking action against Inspire magazine, published on the Internet by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.'b'The organization is a sworn enemy of the United States, and its web publication is available throughout the land. The online magazine proclaims its goals of providing inspiration and justification to inflict harm on the United States as well as Britain, France and other countries, by killing its citizens, preferably in large numbers. It encourages its readers to engage in attacks.'b'The magazine has given instructions for building car bombs as well as pressure-cooker bombs using material from a kitchen or a hardware store. Those instructions were followed to the letter by the Tsarnaev brothers, who murdered three and sent 264 to hospitals in the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing.'b'It also \xe2\x80\x94 in its issue this past Christmas Eve \xe2\x80\x94 shared a new bomb recipe aimed at bringing down civilian airliners. According to Inspire, the new bomb would not be detected by the Transportation Security Administration metal detectors, only potentially by sniffer machines. But even if detected, the bomb probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be discovered, the publication says, without probing into orifices that a T.S.A. officer might be reluctant to visit.'b'In Britain, possession of the online magazine is a crime. Is this publication protected by our First Amendment? Not on your life!'b'In 1791, our forebears, anxious lest the new government adopt some of the restrictions that had been imposed by the king, adopted a basic commandment barring the government from making any law \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Does that mean what it says? Obviously not, because we have adopted many laws abridging speech, such as in cases of child porn, perjury, false representation, libel and slander, criminal conspiracy, etc. The list is substantial. When it comes to political speech, how do we distinguish the good speech from the bad? We look to bedrock principles.'b'For example, threats are not protected because they provide no social value. The idea behind the First Amendment, wrote the founders, was that the citizens be free to criticize their government. And over the next several centuries, our courts have developed a great body of law refining and expanding that concept. In the area of national security and politics, there are no wrong ideas, and free speech is indispensable to the disclosure of truth.'b'The most recent and most expansive Supreme Court decision on protected speech in the context of national security was the 'b'Brandenburg case'b' in 1969, which struck down an Ohio law that criminalized advocacy of crime, violence or terrorism as a means of accomplishing political reform. The statute was unconstitutional, the court said, because political speech is protected unless it is \xe2\x80\x9cdirected to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action.\xe2\x80\x9d Because this Ohio statute did not adequately distinguish between abstract advocacy versus true incitement to imminent action, the conviction of Clarence Brandenburg, a Ku Klux Klan leader, was reversed.'b'In looking at the question of what speech is protected and what is not, courts have always looked to context. For example, every Supreme Court decision on this subject recognizes war as an exception to the First Amendment, even though the Constitution says no such thing. The classic example cited by the older cases is recognition of the government\xe2\x80\x99s unfettered right, in time of war, to ban the publication of information revealing the sailing dates of troop transports. Ten years after Brandenburg, a district judge in the United States v. Progressive case enjoined the publication of classified nuclear bomb formulas. The court found that times had changed, war was no longer limited to foot soldiers who travel to battle sites on troop transports, and even though it was not clear that a reader would imminently \xe2\x80\x9cbuild a hydrogen bomb in the basement,\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of the danger overwhelmed the imminence factor.'b'The balancing act was succinctly explained by Robert W. Warren, the district court chief judge who, when referring to Patrick Henry\xe2\x80\x99s famous liberty-or-death choice, 'b'wrote'b', \xe2\x80\x9cin the short run, one cannot enjoy freedom of speech, freedom to worship, freedom of the press unless one first enjoys the freedom to live.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The balancing test must look at what is real. The measurement of imminence changes when we are talking about detonating a nuclear bomb in New York City as opposed to an unlicensed rally blocking the Brooklyn Bridge.'b'The federal government should move decisively to block Inspire on the web. It is criminal incitement that has produced lawless action, and no sentient judge would today say otherwise.'b'It is one thing for Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. to excuse the journalist James Risen from revealing a book source, and quite another to permit virulent enemies to recruit, train and support those who would destroy our country. If we sanction this kind of so-called freedom, we risk horrible consequences. The Paris killings are small stuff compared with what would happen if our civilian airline system were crippled.

Listening to them, the only surprise in the rise of the left-wing Syriza party, which is expected to come in first in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s general election, is that it has taken so long for an anti-austerity party to come to the fore.'b'Alexis Tsipras, Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s charismatic 40-year-old leader, has been campaigning under the banner \xe2\x80\x9cHope is on its way.\xe2\x80\x9d He has vowed to undo the austerity program mandated by the troika of international creditors \xe2\x80\x94 the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund \xe2\x80\x94 and at the same time to somehow reduce the country\xe2\x80\x99s debt and remain in the eurozone. Fulfilling these contradictory promises may not be possible, but to a lot of people that\xe2\x80\x99s not the point \xe2\x80\x94 voting for Syriza is another way of saying \xe2\x80\x9cEnough.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The incumbent prime minister, Antonis Samaras, has insisted that the radical left wants to drive Greece out of the euro, and that the only path for Greece is to stay the course of painful reforms and budget cuts that he has led.'b'Recent opinion polls showed Mr. Samaras\xe2\x80\x99s center-right New Democracy party only four to six percentage points behind Syriza. So even if Syriza does come in first, it will probably need a coalition to form a government. Given the variety of parties and passions likely to come out of the elections, the next government may not be around for long.'b'All this makes for a frightening welter of unknowns as voters approach decision time. If Mr. Tsipras goes ahead with his promise to cut taxes and restore social spending without finding new sources of funding, the \xe2\x80\x9ctroika\xe2\x80\x9d bailout could be cut short. Without the bailout, Greece would face the risk of a default on its massive sovereign debt. And failing to meet its debts would raise the possibility of a \xe2\x80\x9cGrexit,\xe2\x80\x9d a Greek exit from the eurozone.'b'Though Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has the decisive say in what demands to make of Greece, insists she wants Greece to remain in the eurozone, the possibility of a Greek exit is no longer regarded in Berlin and Brussels as necessarily an unmitigated disaster.'b'For the Greeks, however, it would be, most likely plunging the country into recession, and the large majority of Greeks want the country to remain in the single currency.'b'In any case, Mr. Tsipras has given signals that he may be open to a more sensible course than his radical party platform. Polls show that a strong majority of Greeks, 61 percent, want consensus in talks with the troika, and the optimistic scenario is that his left-wing credentials would give him the credibility to urge more patience.'b'Another question is whether Berlin and Brussels really mean their tough talk about Greece. Mrs. Merkel repeated in her keynote speech at Davos that Greece must accept responsibility for its mountain of debt. But there seems to be a growing sentiment among economists in Europe that debt relief is essential to bringing the Greek economy back from the depths. Whether Greeks \xe2\x80\x9cdeserve\xe2\x80\x9d punishing austerity after years of profligacy, as many in northern Europe continue to maintain, is not the right question. The question is how to allow Greece to move forward and to avoid a political catastrophe that would inevitably have ramifications for the rest of Europe.'b'Mr. Tsipras or whoever wins Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s election must understand that there is no easy, painless exit out of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s troubles. But Germany and the troika must understand that sticking with their flawed and dogmatic insistence on austerity can only create more misery and desperation \xe2\x80\x94 and a more radical response next time.'b'On Wednesday, the day after President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address, a handful of Democratic House members, along with one senator, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, held a news conference to denounce one of the very few proposals the president put forward that actually has a chance of passage. The objects of their displeasure were the new trade agreements currently being negotiated by the administration.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSince I\xe2\x80\x99ve been in Congress, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a trade bill that in any way benefited U.S. manufacturers and workers,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Louise Slaughter, who has represented the Rochester area for 28 years. She pointed to Kodak as an example of a company harmed by trade accords, especially the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Since the deal between the U.S., Canada and Mexico went into effect in 1994, Kodak\xe2\x80\x99s Rochester work force has shrunk to 2,300 from 39,300.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are fighting for the future of middle-class families,\xe2\x80\x9d said Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut. \xe2\x80\x9cThese trade deals make it much easier for corporations to send American jobs overseas.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the past 20 years, Connecticut has lost more than 96,000 manufacturing jobs, she said, because of agreements that failed to protect American workers.'b'Sanders told the assembled media that while he liked the president\xe2\x80\x99s speech, \xe2\x80\x9che was wrong on one major issue, and that is the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe that continuing a set of bad policies, policies that have failed, makes any sense at all.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a trade agreement currently being negotiated between 12 countries, including Japan, Canada, Vietnam, Mexico, Australia and Peru; the countries involved in the negotiations represent nearly 40 percent of 'b'global gross domestic product'b'. It is as complex as it is ambitious.'b'Yet, while the Republican leadership has vowed to work with President Obama on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (as well as on another deal being negotiated with the European Union), the Democrats have been vocal in their opposition. In the short term, they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to give the president so-called fast-track authority, which would allow the administration to negotiate the deal and then hand Congress a finalized agreement that it could only vote up or down, with no amendments. (Fast-track procedures have been used to conclude 14 trade agreements since 1974.)'b'You\xe2\x80\x99d need a heart of stone not to be sympathetic to the concerns of the Democrats. Over the last two decades, lots of manufacturing jobs have vanished in the United States, inflicting a great deal of pain on workers. During those same 20 years, Nafta has been in force. Linking those job losses to the existence of Nafta is a leap the Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 and progressives in general \xe2\x80\x94 have made.'b'The question that needs to be asked, however, is whether that link is justified. \xe2\x80\x9cI am skeptical of definitive judgments on Nafta,\xe2\x80\x9d said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \xe2\x80\x9cWe started offshoring television assembly in the 1960s\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 decades before Nafta. Yes, many assembly plants have been built in Mexico since Nafta went into effect. But 'b'China'b', where millions more manufacturing jobs have migrated \xe2\x80\x94 and with which we have a huge trade deficit \xe2\x80\x94 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have a trade agreement with the United States.'b'Edward Gresser, the executive director of Progressive Economy, a left-leaning think tank, noted that other factors were taking place at the same time as Nafta: the growth of container ships, the lowering cost of communications, the rise of global industries. With or without trade deals, globalization is an unstoppable force. What Nafta really is, Gresser told me, is a proxy for globalization.'b'One mistake the Nafta negotiators made more than two decades ago was taking worker rights and environmental protections out of the agreement itself and putting them into a side letter. They were never effectively enforced. Those negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership expect to rectify that error this go-round. They are also aiming to pry open the Japanese auto and agricultural markets to American producers, and include protections for a free and open Internet. It has, in other words, a lot more potential to do good than harm.'b'When I spoke to Slaughter on Thursday afternoon, she was still riled up. \xe2\x80\x9cThese crazy trade agreements,\xe2\x80\x9d she called them at one point. She added, \xe2\x80\x9cRochester really suffered.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She told me about all the jobs lost at Kodak. \xe2\x80\x9cI think Nafta brought down Kodak,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. But of course it didn\xe2\x80\x99t. 'b'Kodak\xe2\x80\x99s problems'b' came about because digital photography made film unnecessary and Kodak didn\xe2\x80\x99t shift course in time. She was blaming Nafta for Kodak\xe2\x80\x99s self-inflicted wounds.'b'But then her tone brightened. She told me about all the new companies \xe2\x80\x94 55 in all, she said \xe2\x80\x94 that had taken space in the old Kodak buildings. Some were even run by former Kodak engineers.'b'Which, of course, is precisely the way globalization is supposed to work.'b'Tough week for the House Republicans. Speaker John Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s high point must have been not clapping when President Obama talked about job growth in the State of the Union.'b'After that, things went downhill fast. Anti-abortion groups converged on Washington on Thursday to protest the anniversary of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Roe v. Wade decision. The plan was for the House to welcome them into town by passing a bill banning abortions after 20 weeks. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t work out.'b'The signs had been bad for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. In committee, its sponsor, Trent Franks, a Republican from Arizona, claimed that the number of rapes resulting in pregnancy was \xe2\x80\x9cvery low.\xe2\x80\x9d He did not actually say that a woman can\xe2\x80\x99t get pregnant if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy the sex, but it seemed for a minute as if we\xe2\x80\x99d returned to that neighborhood.'b'Whoops. The bill was amended to provide an exemption for women who had been raped. But that sparked a new fight over whether the exemption should be for all victims of rape or just the ones who had reported the crime to the police. A group of Republican women, including Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina, pointed out, correctly, that most victims don\xe2\x80\x99t file such reports.'b'You may remember that Ellmers was challenged last fall by former \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Idol\xe2\x80\x9d runner-up Clay Aiken, who she defeated handily. Now Aiken, who turns out to have been filming his campaign, is moving forward to become the star of a TV reality series on elections. And probably having more fun than Ellmers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sorry Clay Aiken lost,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'tweeted the conservative blogger Erick Erickson'b' when Republican leaders gave up and pulled the 20-week bill from the calendar. A contributor on 'b'the Red State blog followed up'b' with the somewhat less playful: \xe2\x80\x9cIs Renee Ellmers Worthy of Life?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Actually, it turns out that Ellmers is a co-sponsor of the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which holds that every fertilized egg has \xe2\x80\x9call legal and constitutional attributes and privileges.\xe2\x80\x9d Her concerns about the language of the rape exemption seem to have been a mixture of legal, philosophical and political concerns, all of them nuanced in the extreme. She suggested to National Journal that her party shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be starting off the year with an issue that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t of interest to \xe2\x80\x9cmillennials.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rape exemptions have come to dominate the abortion debate. Abortion rights groups use lack of concern for rape victims as an illustration of the heartlessness of their opponents. Their opponents propose exemptions to show that they\xe2\x80\x99re reasonable. But, really, it makes no sense either way. The question of when a fetus inside a woman\xe2\x80\x99s body becomes a human being is theological. If you truly believe that human life begins the moment a sperm fertilizes an egg, you can\xe2\x80\x99t admit any exceptions. The only real debate is whether you get to impose your religious beliefs on the entire country.'b'Not that anybody\xe2\x80\x99s trying to be that rational. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to need your help to find a way out of this definitional problem with rape,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Lindsey Graham told the anti-abortion marchers. This was four days after Graham announced that he was considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination. It\xe2\x80\x99s very possible that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthis definitional problem with rape\xe2\x80\x9d will last longer than his candidacy.'b'In his speech, Graham gave a shout-out to exemptions for rape and incest. \xe2\x80\x9cSome disagree, including the pope,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted to the marchers. Francis has, indeed, been clear and consistent on this matter, despite the moment on a flight back from Manila when he expressed concern about people breeding \xe2\x80\x9clike rabbits.\xe2\x80\x9d One theologian told CBS News that people should understand that there was a difference between the pope-on-a-plane and the pope-on-the-ground, the latter\xe2\x80\x99s comments being more official.'b'Perhaps we could all use this distinction in our daily lives. When your spouse quotes something you wish you\xe2\x80\x99d never said, just explain that was an \xe2\x80\x9cin-the-air\xe2\x80\x9d remark.'b'Anyhow, about the House and abortion.'b'The moderate Republican women scored a big win \xe2\x80\x94 at least until a backlash from the right had their aides shooing away reporters. But other party members said they, too, were sick of fooling around with the Tea Party\xe2\x80\x99s agenda. \xe2\x80\x9cWeek 1, we had the vote for the speaker. Week 2, we debated deporting children. Week 3, we\xe2\x80\x99re debating rape and incest. I just can\xe2\x80\x99t wait for Week 4,\xe2\x80\x9d Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania 'b'complained to Jeremy Peters of The Times'b'.'b'Humiliated by the collapse of the 20-week bill, House leaders quickly substituted one banning federal funding for abortion, which is already banned.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was such a high priority that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t think about it until late last night,\xe2\x80\x9d sniped Representative Daniel Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, during the rather lethargic debate.'b'The bill passed easily. No matter. It was all just in the air.'b'AS jury selection continues in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the defendant in the Boston Marathon bombings, so does debate about what would constitute a fair and impartial jury. Questions have been raised about the race, gender, age and religiosity of prospective jurors; about the effect of holding the trial in Boston; and about the legal requirement that the jurors be open to the possibility of sentencing the defendant to death.'b'But recent research of ours suggests that another, largely overlooked factor may also play an important role in the trial: whether the jurors perceive Mr. Tsarnaev as white.'b'No sooner did the F.B.I. release photographs of Mr. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, three days after the bombings, than questions arose about the racial identity of the suspects. (\xe2\x80\x9cAre the Tsarnaev Brothers White?\xe2\x80\x9d ran a headline in Salon.) Although neither brother matched the visual prototype of a white American, both hailed from the Caucasus, the region that gave rise to the term \xe2\x80\x9cCaucasian,\xe2\x80\x9d and both had lived in America for many years.'b'In the aftermath of the bombings, we sought to answer two questions: If white people perceived Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as less white, did that influence their support for treating him harshly? (Tamerlan was dead by this point.) And if people varied in how white they considered Mr. Tsarnaev to be, what psychological propensities, if any, determined whether they perceived him as more like \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d or more like \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d? We, along with three of our colleagues, 'b'published our findings last year'b' in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.'b'Within hours of the F.B.I.\xe2\x80\x99s release of the suspects\xe2\x80\x99 photographs, we collected responses from 426 white Americans to a broad questionnaire assessing a range of their demographic information as well as aspects of their ideological orientations. Eight days later, we offered these same participants the opportunity to respond to a second questionnaire. Here, we presented them with the original F.B.I. photos, and asked them to tell us how white they thought the suspects looked.'b'We then asked the participants whether they endorsed statements such as \xe2\x80\x9cI hope the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon attacks rots in hell\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIt is O.K. for Tsarnaev not to have been read his Miranda rights before interrogation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rush to judgment in bringing the perpetrator of the Boston Marathon attacks to justice.\xe2\x80\x9d They were also asked to indicate the sentence that they felt Mr. Tsarnaev ought to receive should he be found guilty, with options ranging from \xe2\x80\x9ca maximum of 20 years in prison with the possibility of parole\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We found that there was substantial ambiguity about whether the Tsarnaev brothers were white. On a scale from zero (nonwhite) to 100 (white), the participants varied in their perceptions, with ratings running the full gamut from zero to 100. The average rating was around 64.'b'Which individuals were less likely to \xe2\x80\x9cgrant\xe2\x80\x9d the Tsarnaevs whiteness? In our initial questionnaire, we focused on two ideological outlooks that have been well studied by political psychologists: the belief that some groups of people are superior to others (\xe2\x80\x9csocial dominance orientation\xe2\x80\x9d) and the belief in the importance of following traditions and respecting authorities (\xe2\x80\x9cright-wing authoritarianism\xe2\x80\x9d). We found that participants who scored high in either outlook were less likely to perceive the Tsarnaev brothers as looking white, effectively steering the brothers into \xe2\x80\x9coutsider\xe2\x80\x9d territory.'b'We also found that such whiteness perceptions had the potential to play an important role in the outcome of Mr. Tsarnaev\xe2\x80\x99s trial. The lower that individuals rated Mr. Tsarnaev as looking white, the more willing they were to punish him severely. In a case like Mr. Tsarnaev\xe2\x80\x99s, where guilt is widely presumed and where the outcome will most likely fall on one side of the line between life imprisonment and death, this finding seems especially relevant.'b'One implication of our research is the need to expand what factors play a role in determining jury makeup. If your tendency to perceive a defendant as more like \xe2\x80\x9cus\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthem\xe2\x80\x9d is reliably predicted by certain of your ideological beliefs, and if those beliefs can influence factors critical to the impartiality of the legal process, then jury screening questionnaires should measure them.'b'In an increasingly multiracial world, trying racially ambiguous defendants will become only more common. Just as we ask potential jurors questions like \xe2\x80\x9cDo you go to church?\xe2\x80\x9d we need to ask questions like \xe2\x80\x9cIs having a decent respectable appearance still the mark of a lady?\xe2\x80\x9d (one of many questions used to gauge right-wing authoritarianism) and \xe2\x80\x9cIf certain groups of people \xe2\x80\x98stayed in their place,\xe2\x80\x99 would we have fewer problems?\xe2\x80\x9d (social dominance orientation).'b'By using such information, courts can better take into account the broader ideological balance of a potential jury.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 A HISTORIC change of roles is at the heart of the clamor and turmoil over the collapse of oil prices, which have plummeted by 50 percent since September. For decades, Saudi Arabia, backed by the Persian Gulf emirates, was described as the \xe2\x80\x9cswing producer.\xe2\x80\x9d With its immense production capacity, it could raise or lower its output to help the global market adjust to shortages or surpluses.'b'But on Nov. 27, at the OPEC meeting in Vienna, Saudi Arabia effectively resigned from that role and OPEC handed over all responsibility for oil prices to the market, which the Saudi oil minister, Ali Al-Naimi, predicted would \xe2\x80\x9cstabilize itself eventually.\xe2\x80\x9d OPEC\xe2\x80\x99s decision was hardly unanimous. Venezuela and Iran, their economies in deep trouble, lobbied hard for production cutbacks, to no avail. Afterward, Iran accused Saudi Arabia of waging an \xe2\x80\x9coil war\xe2\x80\x9d and being part of a \xe2\x80\x9cplot\xe2\x80\x9d against it.'b'By leaving oil prices to the market, Saudi Arabia and the emirates also passed the responsibility as de facto swing producer to a country that hardly expected it \xe2\x80\x94 the United States. This approach is expected to continue with the accession of the new Saudi king, Salman, following the death on Friday of King Abdullah. And it means that changes in American production will now, along with that of Persian Gulf producers, also have a major influence on global oil prices.'b'America was once, by far, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest oil producer and exporter, and its swing producer. The Texas Railroad Commission determined \xe2\x80\x9callowable\xe2\x80\x9d levels of production for Texas, the Saudi Arabia of the day. But by 1970, United States oil production had reached its high point of 9.6 million barrels per day and began to decline.'b'The United States began to import more and more oil. By 2008, its own oil production was down almost 50 percent from the high point. Oil prices reached $147 a barrel, and fears that the world\xe2\x80\x99s oil production had peaked and that we were beginning to run out of oil had become pervasive.'b'Quietly, though, an unconventional oil and gas revolution was beginning to pick up speed in the United States. It yoked together two technologies: hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. The impact was measured first in the rapidly growing production of shale gas, which now makes up about half of total American gas. This \xe2\x80\x9cshale gale\xe2\x80\x9d catapulted the United States ahead of Russia to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s No. 1 gas producer.'b'Then around 2010, the same technologies started to be seriously applied to the search for oil. The results were phenomenal. By the end of 2014, oil production in the United States was 80 percent higher than it had been in 2008. The increase of 4.1 million barrels per day was greater than the output of every single OPEC country but Saudi Arabia.'b'Today, American output is almost back to where it was in 1970. On top of that was a million-barrel-a-day gain since 2008 from the Canadian oil sands. The chimera of \xe2\x80\x9cenergy independence\xe2\x80\x9d began to look more tangible, at least for North America.'b'This revolution also turned out to be a big boost for the American economy, creating jobs, improving the country\xe2\x80\x99s competitive position and drawing in over a $100 billion of new investment. Only rarely has the global oil market seen production increases on this scale this fast. The last time was in the early 1980s, when new supplies from Mexico, the North Sea and Alaska created an oil surplus that led to a price crash.'b'This time, several things postponed a price collapse. One was the growing consumption in the developing world, led by China. Another was turmoil in Libya, South Sudan and other countries that reduced supply. Over a million barrels per day were also taken off the market by sanctions imposed on Iran. Without that big surge of shale oil from the United States, it is highly likely that those sanctions would have failed. Prices would have spiked, countries seeking cheaper oil would have broken ranks \xe2\x80\x94 and Iran might not be at the nuclear negotiating table today.'b'By the middle of last summer, however, circumstances changed. World economic growth was slowing. Europe was on its back. Since 2004, China\xe2\x80\x99s rapidly rising demand for oil had been the defining factor for the global oil market. But China\xe2\x80\x99s economy was slowing, too, and that meant slowing growth in oil demand. At the same time, Libya managed to quadruple its oil output, at least for a time. That was the trigger for the beginning of the price decline.'b'It was assumed that OPEC would step in and cut production to boost the price. Trillions of dollars of investment have been made over the last several years on that premise.'b'But Saudi Arabia and the other gulf countries declined to do so. If they reduced production, they reasoned, they would lose market share permanently. As they saw it, they would be cutting back on their \xe2\x80\x9clow cost oil\xe2\x80\x9d to make room for \xe2\x80\x9chigh cost oil,\xe2\x80\x9d and then would have to make more cuts to accommodate more high cost oil.'b'They were looking at competition not only from American shale oil but also from Canadian oil sands and new supplies from Russia, the Arctic, Brazil, Central Asia, Africa and growing volumes of offshore oil around the world.'b'But, most immediately, they were looking at two neighbors. They did not want to give up markets to Iraq, a country they see as an Iranian satellite, and whose output is increasing. And they certainly did not want to make way for Iran, which they thought might come to a nuclear deal with the United States and its allies, bringing that missing Iranian oil back into the market.'b'The depth of the price fall may be much more than even some of the gulf producers anticipated. Around the world, oil companies are cutting budgets, paring costs, slowing down projects and postponing new ones. Some may end up being canceled.'b'Saudi Arabia is hoping that lower oil prices will stimulate economic growth and demand for oil. In the meantime, with their large holdings of foreign reserves, Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf emirates can afford to wait.'b'That is not true for many of the other oil exporters. Venezuela is highly vulnerable to turmoil and even financial collapse. Russia is coping not only with lower prices for oil, which provides over 40 percent of government revenues, but with Ukraine-related sanctions, and seems headed into a deep recession.'b'Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa and the continent\xe2\x80\x99s most populous nation, is also at risk. The oil sector represents 95 percent of export earnings and 75 percent of government revenues. And its revenues are falling as it needs more money to fight the Boko Haram Islamist insurgency.'b'Over all, the fall in oil prices could mean a $1.5 to $2 trillion transfer from oil-exporting countries to oil-importing countries. Japan will be a big beneficiary. So will China. American consumers will benefit, too, though it will also mean that fewer oil wells will be drilled here, more rigs will be laid up and increasing numbers of workers will be let go.'b'American shale oil has become the decisive new factor in the world oil market in a way that could not have been imagined five years ago. It has proved to be a truly disruptive technology. But will that impact continue in a world of low prices?'b'Oil is now below $50 a barrel, a price too low for a good deal of the new shale oil development to make economic sense. Yet output is likely to continue to rise by another 500,000 barrels per day in the first half of 2015 because of sheer momentum and commitments already made.'b'Come the middle of the year, however, growth will flatten out. Producers will work hard to improve efficiency and lower costs, but in 2016, at these prices, American output could decline. Production elsewhere in the world will also be flattening.'b'But by then, the world economy might be doing better, stimulating oil demand. Prices could start rising again. If the gulf producers have their way, prices will not go back to $100 a barrel. Even at prices well below $100, American shale oil producers will find ways to drive down costs and output will start rising again. And the world\xe2\x80\x99s new swing producer will find itself back in the swing of things.'b'There have been powerful reminders in recent days that the financial system needs more regulatory vigilance, not less. But they come just as Republicans are setting their agenda in Congress, complete with vows to weaken the Dodd-Frank reform law.'b'On Thursday, The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Nathaniel Popper 'b'reported'b' that Goldman Sachs is using the bank\xe2\x80\x99s money to make big bets in real estate. That appears to be a violation of the spirit, if not the letter, of Dodd-Frank, which aims to avoid bailouts by reducing concentrated risks at banks.'b'Similarly, the still-unfolding fallout from the unexpected surge this month in the value of the Swiss franc \xe2\x80\x94 including 'b'huge losses'b' at brokerages and hedge funds \xe2\x80\x94 serves as a reminder that certain foreign-exchange derivatives were 'b'allowed to escape regulation'b' under Dodd-Frank. The argument against such regulation, as put forth by Obama officials, was that foreign exchange trading is staid and stable, a view that never made sense and that has since been undermined, not only by the volatile Swiss franc episode, but by recent 'b'revelations of widespread manipulation'b' of the foreign-exchange market by big banks.'b'Unfortunately, those regulatory challenges are not the only ways in which Dodd-Frank\xe2\x80\x99s promise has gone unmet. The law required regulators to write hundreds of rules and conduct dozens of studies before the law\xe2\x80\x99s many reforms could be put into place. In the process, some regulators found room to indulge their pro-bank biases. Regulators were also subject to unrelenting pressure \xe2\x80\x94 by bank lobbyists; by Republicans, who have been hostile to the law from the start; and by several Democrats, who want credit for passing the law but also want to please their Wall Street contributors.'b'The result has been delays, weak rules and political setbacks, including budget constraints that impair regulatory enforcement of the law and, recently, the outright repeal of a provision to curb excessive speculation by banks. In a maneuver that hints at things to come, that repeal was achieved by 'b'attaching the provision to a spending bill'b' that President Obama and many congressional Democrats said was more important than standing firm on the reform.'b'Going forward, even the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the biggest success of the Dodd-Frank law, is threatened by Republicans who want to change the agency\xe2\x80\x99s financing and leadership structure to make it less independent.'b'The question is whether President Obama and Democrats in Congress will repel the efforts of opponents to strip away reforms before they even have a chance to take root.'b'MAYOR BILL DE BLASIO recently got some good news in his standoff with the Police Department. In the\xc2\xa0'b'first major poll'b' conducted after the high-profile murder of two patrolmen, 69 percent of New Yorkers said they objected to police officers\xe2\x80\x99 turning their backs on the mayor at their colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 funerals, while 77 percent rejected a union boss\xe2\x80\x99s accusation that the mayor shared blame for the deaths. Over all, more than half of New Yorkers said that they believed that discipline had \xe2\x80\x9cbroken down\xe2\x80\x9d among police.'b'And yet the widespread impression of police overreach didn\xe2\x80\x99t translate into much support for Mr. de Blasio himself. When Quinnipiac University, which conducted the poll, subsequently 'b'released'b' the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating, it had hardly budged from December, ticking up a meager two points to 49 percent.'b'In the aftermath of Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s landslide victory in 2013, it was tempting to believe that he had pioneered a new style of progressive politics, one that built on President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s coalition of African-Americans, Latinos and liberals. Whereas Mr. Obama twice lost white voters by 'b'double digits'b', Mr. de Blasio won them by a remarkable 'b'11 points'b'.'b'But instead of transcending the Obama coalition, Mr. de Blasio has become its prisoner.'b'In fact, Mr. de Blasio never had a chance of maintaining the 'b'72 percent support'b' that propelled him to Gracie Mansion. Running against a weak, underfunded Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic city inflated his margins. And subsequent events \xe2\x80\x94 from his ham-handed showdowns with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to his 'b'graceless defense'b' of a discredited aide \xe2\x80\x94 have revealed his political instincts to be less than impeccable.'b'But the key factor is his worldview. From the get-go, Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s campaign fused two distinct strands of progressivism.\xc2\xa0The first was economic populism, not least his 'b'criticism'b' that Michael R. Bloomberg had placed the interests of Wall Street and the wealthy above those of average New Yorkers.'b'The second was what some have 'b'called'b' \xe2\x80\x9cidentity group\xe2\x80\x9d liberalism, which appealed to black and Latino voters as blacks and Latinos, not on the basis of economic interests they shared with whites. The centerpiece of Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s identity-group agenda was his promise to win better treatment for minorities at the hands of the police.'b'The problem for Mr. de Blasio is that only the first approach has widespread appeal. In 'b'a poll'b' Quinnipiac released shortly after his inauguration, almost 70 percent of voters backed the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed tax increase on families making over $500,000. Eighty-three percent were concerned about income inequality (though few listed it as their top concern). But only 48 percent of voters said that Mr. de Blasio would be able to ease the Police Department\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstop and frisk\xe2\x80\x9d tactics without sacrificing public safety.'b'Once voters focused on the identity portion of Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s agenda, it was inevitable that his numbers would suffer. The only surprise is how quickly that happened. The same post-inauguration poll put Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s approval rating at 53 percent \xe2\x80\x94 20 points below his election-night tally. A substantial number of voters had deserted the mayor only days into his term.'b'In retrospect, Mr. de Blasio might have predicted this fate based on Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s bumpy tenure. Like Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s, the president\xe2\x80\x99s struggles derive from more than just his choice of priorities; a brutal recession, a relentless opposition party, even latent racism all played a role. Still, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to bet his presidency on health care made it all but impossible to build support among whites. Many of them believed (not entirely correctly) that he was spending roughly a trillion dollars to expand health coverage for 'b'other\xc2\xa0 people'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that he was a classic identity-group liberal, in other words. After losing white voters by 'b'12 points'b' in 2008, Mr. Obama lost them by 'b'20 points'b' four years later.'b'Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s choice of crusade was even riskier. If you were to rank issues by their potential to unite whites and minority voters, the most promising would be populist economic issues like 'b'raising taxes on the rich'b'. Somewhere in the middle would be an issue like health care, which has large economic benefits for both whites and nonwhites, even if opponents can portray it as a sop to the latter. At the very bottom would be issues with little economic content, but which different racial groups view in radically different ways.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no better example of this final category than policing, especially after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner last summer. In the 'b'latest Quinnipiac poll'b', blacks approve of Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s handling of \xe2\x80\x9crelations between the police and the community\xe2\x80\x9d by a two-to-one ratio; whites\xc2\xa0disapprove by the same ratio. In effect, Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s identity-group liberalism has capped his level of support. Inroads among African-Americans tend to coincide with a decline among whites.'b'Of course, given the country\xe2\x80\x99s changing demography, the same dynamic can raise a politician\xe2\x80\x99s floor of support even while it lowers his or her ceiling, insuring against a steep drop in popularity. President Obama managed to win re-election in 2012 by largely 'b'preserving his margins'b' among blacks and liberals (whose share of the electorate increased), while improving his margins among Hispanics. Even at the low point of Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s confrontation with the police, his approval rating was a hardly catastrophic 47 percent.'b'The lesson of Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s first year isn\xe2\x80\x99t so much that his mayoral strategy was misguided. As with Mr. Obama and health care, there\xe2\x80\x99s no shame in attempting historic reforms en route to a narrow re-election. The real lesson is that Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s brand of liberalism isn\xe2\x80\x99t a basis for Democratic dominance, as his boosters once enthused. Politically, economic populism trumps identity-group appeals.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson the president has learned, building his State of the Union address around the idea of raising taxes on the wealthy to fund child care and college tuition for low- and middle-income families. It\xe2\x80\x99s a safe bet that Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s next campaign will reflect this wisdom, too. In an op-ed article 'b'he wrote'b' just after his party lost the Senate last fall, Mr. de Blasio advised Democrats to run on reducing inequality and reining in corporations. Nowhere on his list of recommendations did the word \xe2\x80\x9cpolice\xe2\x80\x9d appear.'b'EVERY news broadcaster, commentator and writer has proclaimed the massacre of the French satirical cartoonists and editorialists to be a tragedy. And perhaps it was. But then, so we are told, was the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.'b'Broadcasters and reporters daily proclaim as tragic the fatalities that result when, say, a family car spins out of control on an icy street and crashes. Just as, every spring, drunken high school students die tragically when they drive off the road. It\xe2\x80\x99s a staple of the prom season.'b'The critic George Steiner declared \xe2\x80\x9cThe Death of Tragedy\xe2\x80\x9d in 1961, but tragedy thrives today. Indeed, these days, any event that causes suffering or distress earns tragedy\xe2\x80\x99s mournful title.'b'But if everything that is avoidable, stupid and simply untoward is tragic, then nothing really is \xe2\x80\x94 not if we insist on its description of a specific kind of human sorrow. In devaluing the word, we devalue what it is meant to express. We trivialize what we wish to make truly important.'b'Since the Greeks first coined the word, tragedy has required not only a calamitous event but one that can be judged as meaningful. It has to matter in some greater manner that is, ideally, instructive.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTragedy is, then, a representation of an action that is heroic and complete,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'argued Aristotle in \xe2\x80\x9cPoetics,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x9cand of a certain magnitude.\xe2\x80\x9d It is never trivial.'b'For an event to qualify as tragedy, its telling demands some kind of emotional catharsis, a resolution to the losses it details. This month\xe2\x80\x99s Je Suis Charlie march in Paris qualifies. But more important, to be worthy of its name, tragedy must instruct.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou emerge from tragedy equipped against lies,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the playwright Howard Baker in 1989. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the musical, you\xe2\x80\x99re anybody\xe2\x80\x99s fool.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Has the Paris massacre made us more aware, more sensitive to lies?'b'Reports suggest that it has merely made us afraid, angry and militant in our responses. That\xe2\x80\x99s something different.'b'In the old days, tragedy was the exclusive province of the great and powerful. With Marlowe\xe2\x80\x99s Doctor Faustus or Shakespeare\xe2\x80\x99s Hamlet, their tragic flaws, enacted, became the definition of tragedy. It may be angst (Hamlet), or hubris (Faustus), but it\xe2\x80\x99s there and we know, watching, that the ruinous end will be of their own making.'b'When tragedy became a common ill, the tragic flaw went republican. No better example exists than Arthur Miller\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDeath of a Salesman\xe2\x80\x9d and its truly tragic hero, Willy Loman, a salesman with nothing to sell.'b'As audience members, we want to say, \xe2\x80\x9cNo, Willie, don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d but we know that his inevitable suicide will be the result not of his failure but of ours, the fault of a society in which employment is a happenstance that can be withdrawn from even the hardest worker. If tragedy is, as Nietzsche believed, about the terrors of reality, then Miller\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy is about not a flaw of character but of our world.'b'And here is the essence of modern \xe2\x80\x9ctragedies\xe2\x80\x9d like the deaths of Michael Brown, 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who took a toy gun into a Cleveland park, and Trayvon Martin at the hands of the self-appointed neighborhood watchman George Zimmerman. Individually, they are sad, senseless, stupid events. In their deaths alone, there is no catharsis, no relief in the telling, nothing instructive and certainly no insurance against either falsehoods or future, similar events.'b'The tragedy resides in the larger context, the greater issues that each suggests but none completes. Together, they appear as inevitable deaths that result from a series of truly tragic American flaws: a system of justice that does not serve populations in need of protection; law enforcement that allows police officers to be a threat to those they are sworn to protect; and inequalities of education and opportunity that ensure the racial divide will continue.'b'The same is true of the Charlie Hebdo murders. There is something sadly comical about the fact that Islamist extremists targeted not essayists or politicians but cartoonists, the court jesters of modern public debate.'b'The tragedy lies not in the simple fact of their murder but in the decades of military encroachment and colonial expansion that helped to radicalize a religious sect. It lies, too, in our culture\xe2\x80\x99s failure to integrate new members in an ethos that is inclusive and assures a political space for legitimate complaint.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s modern tragedy for you. In that sense, tragedy is everywhere lurking, waiting for the next opportunity to show its power. Our tragedy is this collective, fatal flaw, which insists on demonizing those we disagree with and turning them into mortal enemies. The question is whether we will react tragically, breeding more terror in our responses, or, instructed in its causes, search for resolution.'b'Readers discuss the peril that global warming poses for life on earth, and what can be done.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Is a Climate Disaster Inevitable?'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 18):'b'Adam Frank\xe2\x80\x99s perspective as an astrophysicist on the problem of global warming brings the unsettling insight that we may be doomed to pollute ourselves out of existence.

Any attempts to thicken the social safety net through government spending are philosophically inimical to the 'b'G.O.P.'b' point of view. Yet here\xe2\x80\x99s the irony: In their own offices, Republicans are often very generous with federal money, giving their staffs plenty of compensated time off to care for a child.'b'Last week, I wrote to all 100 Senate offices and asked how they individually handled parental leave. While only 26 replied (not surprising, really; it meant voluntarily laying bare their private policies, always a touchy subject), it\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that virtually all of the respondents \xe2\x80\x94 15 Democrats, two independents and nine Republicans \xe2\x80\x94 said they provided paid leave of some kind. What this means, practically speaking, is that all of them go above and beyond what the Family and Medical Leave Act requires \xe2\x80\x94 12 weeks of unpaid leave, assuming both employee and employer meet the requirements.'b'The traditional liberal rap on the Republican Party is that its policies are hostile to working women. But that\xe2\x80\x99s clearly not how Republicans conduct themselves as bosses on Capitol Hill.'b'Marco Rubio, the conservative presidential hopeful from Florida, gives his staff as much paid maternity and paternity leave (12 and six weeks, respectively) as Bernie Sanders, who started his career as an \xe2\x80\x9cunabashed socialist\xe2\x80\x9d in Vermont and went on to co-found the Congressional Progressive Caucus. The Republican Mike Enzi, who successfully beat back a primary challenge from Liz Cheney in Wyoming last year, gives six weeks of paid maternity leave, which is identical to the policy of Dianne Feinstein, once the mayor of highly liberal San Francisco. (Barbara Boxer, also from California, offers 12, to both parents.)'b'In offering eight paid weeks of parental leave for both sexes, the Mississippi Republican Thad Cochran goes further than the Missouri Democrat Claire McCaskill, who offers the same for mothers but for dads, three. The Tennessee Republican Lamar Alexander, the chairman of the HELP Committee (Health, Education, Labor and Pensions) gives 12 paid weeks of maternity leave, which is just a tad more than the Delaware Democrat Chris Coons, who offers 10. (Most of these offices also say their employees can supplement their leave with unused sick and vacation days.)'b'In other words, when confronted with the life challenges of their own personnel, these elected officials all believe paid compensation is in order.'b'One might expect this from Democrats, who, as a matter of principle, believe that governments have an obligation to care for their citizenry when the free market fails to do so. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more surprising from Republicans, who generally speaking, do not. The question is, why?'b'I put this question to Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska, who offers six weeks of paid parental leave (and an extra two for the mother if there are complications during pregnancy). Her position is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a difference between the government\xe2\x80\x99s requesting that employers do something and requiring that they do it. In her office\xe2\x80\x99s case, she says that yes, she decided to set aside money for paid leave, but \xe2\x80\x9cit means making cuts elsewhere \xe2\x80\x94 cutting the number of people we hire over all, or the travel my staff is able to do.\xe2\x80\x9d When it comes to the private sector, she says, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s up to businesses to make that decision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And this belief is perfectly respectable as far as it goes. The problem is that we, as a nation, have been running this experiment for decades now, and the verdict is clear: Without government assistance \xe2\x80\x94 or nudging \xe2\x80\x94 most businesses will never feel the obligation to pay for family leave on their own. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 11 percent of private-sector workers got paid family leave in 2012. As Mr. Obama noted this summer, \xe2\x80\x9cmany women can\xe2\x80\x99t even get a paid day off to give birth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Fischer has attempted to provide a bipartisan solution to this problem by co-authoring a bill with Angus King, a Maine Independent who caucuses with Democrats, that would provide tax credits to businesses offering families paid leave. This notion is surely more palatable to the Republican-led Congress than Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s initiative, which involves $2.2 billion in spending. But Ms. Fischer frankly concedes that she doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect Congress to entertain their bill this session.'b'Yet there\xe2\x80\x99s a solid case to be made that paid family leave is good for business. Three years ago, Rutgers\xe2\x80\x99 Center for Women and Work issued a report showing that women who took paid leave were far more likely to be working for the same employer a year later. It also added that women and men who returned to work after paid leave were far less likely to collect food stamps or public assistance in the year following their child\xe2\x80\x99s birth. As Ms. Fischer herself says, family leave also helps people on her staff \xe2\x80\x9cdo their job well. They\xe2\x80\x99re not preoccupied, they\xe2\x80\x99re not worrying about everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happening at home when they\xe2\x80\x99re at work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'IT\xe2\x80\x99S already a clich\xc3\xa9 to point out that the United States is the sole industrialized nation without a paid maternity leave policy. (In case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering what we have in common with Papua New Guinea, this is it.) According to a Pew study last April, our inability to provide affordable child care as a nation may help explain our declining rates in women\xe2\x80\x99s participation in the work force.'b'Absent state funding and intervention on this matter, it falls to individual families \xe2\x80\x94 small, fragile, closed little loops of two parents (if that) \xe2\x80\x94 to resolve what the state and the private sector do not. It\xe2\x80\x99s utterly exhausting to them. It means a scarcity economy at home, with spouses quarreling about whose career is more important and whose time is more valuable. Someone almost inevitably needs to scale back ambitions or earning power in order to make life work.'b'And that someone, usually, is the mom. Which brings me to this final plea: Even the most enlightened Senate offices \xe2\x80\x94 and private-sector offices \xe2\x80\x94 seem to believe that fathers require fewer weeks of leave than mothers. Mr. Obama himself referred to \xe2\x80\x9cmaternity leave\xe2\x80\x9d in his 'b'State of the Union address'b', not \xe2\x80\x9cparental leave,\xe2\x80\x9d as he had in previous statements. There are hundreds of arguments to make in favor of parity between the sexes when it comes to family leave. (High among them: More engaged dads allow their wives to lean in; more and more gay men are having kids, and shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be subjected to different rules.) But here, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to name a very modest reason: It would make things more tranquil at home. Over and over again in my research, I hear mothers of newborns say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen my husband comes home from work, he wants to comfort the baby, but he can\xe2\x80\x99t, because the baby is used to me.\xe2\x80\x9d And then the fights begin. Because Mom is tired. Mom wants a break.'b'I doubt mothers would be hearing such things if fathers took equal time off from the get-go \xe2\x80\x94 paid or unpaid.

Instead, his White House tended to take on the coloration of his funks and the clouds spread worldwide.'b'He only began to really brag on the economy Tuesday night, when he felt certain of the numbers, rather than before the midterms, when it might have helped his party.

Instead, they got the State of the Veto Threat Address.'b'The president goaded Republicans, who chortled when he reminded them he was done running for office. He shot back with his favorite snarky rejoinder to Republicans: I won.'b'Obama won the presidency by creating a magnetic narrative. But then, oddly, he lost the thread of his story and began drifting. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get to the point Bill Clinton did, where he had to insist he was relevant, though last summer, some of his frustrated hopey-change-y acolytes talked about having an intervention with the rudderless president. But others argued against it, pointing out that, while Obama might not have the presidency that was giddily anticipated, during the 2009 tulip-craze phase, he was doing what he wanted.'b'He wanted to do what he saw as right and have the public and the pols come along simply because he said it was right.'b'But when the Potomac didn\xe2\x80\x99t part when he was elected, he got grumpy and decided not to play the game.'b''b'As David Axelrod said'b', and as Obama concurred, the president was resistant to the symbolism and theatrical aspect of his office. He never got it that the emotional component of the presidency is real, whether it\xe2\x80\x99s wooing lawmakers or comforting the nation.'b'When the public was jittery about ISIS, Ebola and Ferguson, Obama responded like a law professor. He made a stunning speech on race to save his 2008 campaign, but he has stayed largely detached from the roiling race drama that stretched from St. Louis to New York.'b'In Year 7, when everyone else has started focusing on 2016, he suddenly popped up with a full-throated narrative and rationale for his presidency: It is time for the middle class to share the wealth and the Republicans are still protecting the rich.'b'The State of the Union was not so much \xe2\x80\x9ctoo little, too late,\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much, too late.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Republicans said Obama was in \xe2\x80\x9cFantasyland.\xe2\x80\x9d While free community college educations, money for child care, new roads, new taxes on the rich, initiatives on climate change and partying in Cuba are all feel-good ideas for Democrats, a lot of that isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen and he knows it.'b'Though President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s numbers are up, the results are likely to be pretty meager. When he trolled Republicans in his speech, it felt good to him and Democrats jumped for joy. But Republicans will have their revenge \xe2\x80\x94 and not just Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s visit.'b'In the end, the speech told us less about the state of the union than the state of Obama. The state of Obama is strong, if solitary.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'MY mother always believed that when you signed up for a regimen, you owed it your best shot.'b'She was that way with diets. With aerobics.'b'And with religion. For my father she converted, Methodist to Catholic, and she tried to follow the script.'b'But in one way she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t, and it became a staple of her confessions.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForgive me, Father,\xe2\x80\x9d she\xe2\x80\x99d say time and again, in church after church, to confessor after confessor. \xe2\x80\x9cI use contraception.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She never met a priest who didn\xe2\x80\x99t respond with some version of the following, and I\xe2\x80\x99m paraphrasing with abandon:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course you do. You\xe2\x80\x99re sane. Ignore Rome. Forget about the pope. There\xe2\x80\x99s La-La Land, and then there\xe2\x80\x99s the real world, in which you are clearly living. Say three Hail Marys because it can never hurt, and be on your way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m being cheeky. I\xe2\x80\x99m also being honest. There is perhaps no church teaching more widely derided and disobeyed than the hoary prohibition against any birth control other than strategic abstinence, known more euphemistically (and musically!) as the rhythm method.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s none that more squarely places the Catholic hierarchy in opposition to modernity, practicality and prudence, none that gives Catholics more reason to regard some of the church\xe2\x80\x99s edicts as quaint anachronisms and to follow their consciences in lieu of any commands. It\xe2\x80\x99s the gateway estrangement.'b'So when Pope Francis broached the topic last week, he was bound to whip up a storm of attention, even without a choice of words that \xe2\x80\x9cset a new standard for the papal vernacular,\xe2\x80\x9d as The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Elisabetta Povoledo 'b'observed'b'.'b'He was on the papal plane, en route from the Philippines back to Italy, and he was reflecting on the relationship between third-world poverty and extra-large families. He told reporters that Catholics needn\xe2\x80\x99t feel compelled to breed \xe2\x80\x9clike rabbits,\xe2\x80\x9d a zoological simile that\xe2\x80\x99s sure to have legs.'b'St. Francis was reputed to preach to the birds. Pope Francis will be remembered for quipping about the bunnies.'b'Was he signaling an imminent change in church teaching, or was he merely getting carried away with comparisons and colloquialisms, as he tends to do? Just the previous week, after the Charlie Hebdo massacre, he likened besmirching a person\xe2\x80\x99s religion to talking trash about someone\xe2\x80\x99s mother, an insult that he said was sure to provoke a punch.'b'He immediately had to clean up and clarify all of that, and he revisited the \xe2\x80\x9crabbits\xe2\x80\x9d remark as well, dispelling any notion of new doctrine. So where does that leave things?'b'Some history first: The church came close to lifting its condemnation of contraception back in the 1960s, when a significant majority of theologians, bishops and cardinals who were asked to take a formal look at that teaching recommended such a swerve. Pope Paul VI overruled them \xe2\x80\x94 partly, it\xe2\x80\x99s believed, out of fear that an admission of error on the birth-control front might prompt assaults on other teachings and open the fallibility floodgates.'b'But given the church\xe2\x80\x99s chauvinism, was something additional in play? 'b'Patricia Miller'b', a former Catholic who has written extensively about the church and sexuality, advanced that perspective in a book, \xe2\x80\x9cGood Catholics: The Battle Over Abortion in the Catholic Church,\xe2\x80\x9d which was published last year.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaintaining the traditional family, in which men were leaders in the world outside the home and women were confined to the domestic realm by the demands of young children and repeated pregnancies, was a key concern of the Catholic Church,\xe2\x80\x9d she asserted, noting that in the 1950s, Catholic bishops had gone so far as to excoriate working mothers for giving child care short shrift.'b'Whatever the case, the church\xe2\x80\x99s voice on matters sexual became only less and less relevant to many Catholics.'b'At my request, Gallup did a special breakdown of its \xe2\x80\x9cValues and Beliefs\xe2\x80\x9d survey from last May and looked at how the principles of people who identified themselves as Catholics diverged (or didn\xe2\x80\x99t) from those of Americans on the whole. Catholics were only slightly less open to birth control, with 86 percent of them saying that it was \xe2\x80\x9cmorally acceptable\xe2\x80\x9d in comparison with 90 percent of all respondents. But Catholics were 'b'more'b' permissive than all respondents when it came to sex outside marriage (acceptable to 72 percent of Catholics versus 66 percent of Americans overall) and gay and lesbian relationships (70 percent versus 58).'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re well aware of the Vatican\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncements. They just prefer to plug their ears.'b'AND more so than his predecessors, Pope Francis acknowledges the discrepancy and seeks to move past it. That\xe2\x80\x99s the leitmotif that runs through many of his most attention-getting remarks and gestures, whether they apply to gays or to couples living together outside of wedlock or to Catholics juggling a dozen kids. He\xe2\x80\x99s not refashioning doctrine; he\xe2\x80\x99s reassessing the frequency and stridency with which it needs to be flung at people, especially when it contradicts their experience of the world and undercuts their connection to the faith and the church.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s wildly practical,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Rev. James Keenan, a moral theologian at Boston College.'b'Keenan told me that while he didn\xe2\x80\x99t hear, in the pope\xe2\x80\x99s reference to rabbits, any clear challenge to traditional teaching, he heard a change in emphasis, from reminders that artificial birth control is verboten to a recognition that people have good reasons, and sometimes even a duty, to manage the size of their families somehow.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t remember, ever, a pope saying to Catholics that they should be mindful of how many children they\xe2\x80\x99re having,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, adding that Francis\xe2\x80\x99s statement was significant for that reason. \xe2\x80\x9cDid he intend it to be? I have no idea. When he says things, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99re off the cuff or not, because he\xe2\x80\x99s so out there. He\xe2\x80\x99s exciting that way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unpredictable, too. The same trip to the Philippines that bred \xe2\x80\x9crabbits\xe2\x80\x9d also sired a lamentation, during a mass in Manila, that was wholly conservative and traditional. Francis said that attempts to \xe2\x80\x9credefine the very institution of marriage\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9clack of openness to life\xe2\x80\x9d threatened the family.'b'He sounded then like any old pope.'b'But what he sounds like at other times is the parish priests encountered by my mother, who felt that four children were fruitfulness enough and was trying to make sense of a creed that sometimes defies it. There are musty traditions and there is messy reality; a true pastor gives the latter the respect it deserves. When he brought up bunnies, Francis was doing precisely that.'b'Like bettors checking Las Vegas odds on the Super Bowl, specialists in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s booming campaign finance industry are tracking the action in the 2016 elections, not so much to assess the candidates as to see how much of a payout is likely this time around in the grand casino of American politics.'b'The record total of $6.3 billion spent on the presidential and congressional elections of 2012 is only the starting point. Estimates of next year\xe2\x80\x99s likely total are running between $7.5 billion and $8 billion. This moneyed universe is certain to keep expanding as the political industry\xe2\x80\x99s managers and their candidates master the unlimited fund-raising and spending devices they now have at hand.'b'The sheer numbers should be enough to raise public alarm. But needed reforms are going nowhere, with too many congressional members busy bolstering their incumbency with the help of the same large-scale donors. In last year\xe2\x80\x99s elections, the 100 biggest campaign check writers gave $323 million, plus many millions more in anonymous donations to politically active \xe2\x80\x9csocial welfare\xe2\x80\x9d groups and other new money troughs. According to 'b'a report by Politico'b', total spending by the 100 ultra-donors exceeded that of the 4.75 million ordinary Americans who made smaller donations of $200 or less.'b'The risk of special-interest corruption? Five years ago, when the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Citizens United decision dashed decades of sensible controls by equating unlimited corporate and union spending with individual free speech, Justice Anthony Kennedy reassured the nation that full disclosure of donors would be safeguard enough.'b'He envisioned a world, nonexistent, where disclosure lets citizens \xe2\x80\x9csee whether elected officials are \xe2\x80\x98in the pocket\xe2\x80\x99 of so-called moneyed interests.\xe2\x80\x9d But Congress then killed healthy disclosure requirements, and the way things are working out, with untraceable donations on the rise, it\xe2\x80\x99s more the reverse: a case of moneyed interests moving snugly into the pockets of grateful officials.'b'Citizens United is just one of the threats to fair campaigning that is posed by runaway money. No less pernicious has been the rise of the nonprofit groups posing as \xe2\x80\x9csocial welfare\xe2\x80\x9d organizations, while in truth they are political machines. This fiction is garnering large donations from players seeking to hide under protections in the tax code. The I.R.S. has timidly retreated from policing this abuse because of Tea Party complaints. The Federal Election Commission, charged with policing campaigns, is even more inert, paralyzed by an enforcement standoff engineered by Republican commissioners.'b'Antidotes to the politics of toxic money, in the form of a package of reforms, were offered last week to the new Congress. One would rein in the super-PAC cornucopia of big money for candidates pretending to be uninvolved. Another would strengthen ordinary Americans\xe2\x80\x99 political speech by updating the public financing system for presidential elections and creating a badly needed new one for congressional races. A third, delivering on Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s dream, would mandate full disclosure of large-scale contributions and of the identities of affluent donors now playing politics from the shadows.'b'But so far, reform of any sort has been no more than a dream. In this unresponsive Congress, it is likely to remain so.'b'THE Western response to the death of Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud, king of Saudi Arabia and custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, followed two paths. Along one, various officials and luminaries offered the gestures \xe2\x80\x94 'b'half-mast flags'b', public obsequies \xe2\x80\x94 expected when a great statesman enters the hereafter. John Kerry described the late monarch as \xe2\x80\x9c'b'a man of wisdom and vision'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9crevered leader.\xe2\x80\x9d Tony Blair called him a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'modernizer of his country'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cstaunch advocate of interfaith relations,\xe2\x80\x9d who was \xe2\x80\x9cloved by his people and will be deeply missed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Along the other path, anyone outside Western officialdom was free to tell the fuller truth: that Abdullah presided over one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most wicked nonpariah states, whose domestic policies are almost cartoonishly repressive and whose international influence has been strikingly malign. His dynasty is founded on gangsterish control over a precious natural resource, sustained by an unholy alliance with a most cruel interpretation of Islam and protected by the United States and its allies out of fear of worse alternatives if it fell.'b'Was he a \xe2\x80\x9cmodernizer\xe2\x80\x9d? Well, there were gestures, like 'b'giving women the vote'b' in elections that don\xe2\x80\x99t particularly matter. But Abdullah\xe2\x80\x99s most important recent legacy has been counterrevolutionary, in his attempts to rally a kind of axis of authoritarianism against the influence of the Arab Spring.'b'Did he believe in \xe2\x80\x9cinterfaith relations\xe2\x80\x9d? Sure, so long as the other faiths were safely outside Saudi territory, where religious uniformity is enforced by the police 'b'and by the lash'b'.'b'Will he be \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply missed\xe2\x80\x9d? Well, not by dissidents, Shiites, non-Muslims, 'b'protestors in neighboring countries'b' ... and for everyone else, only by comparison with the incompetence or chaos or still greater cruelty that might come next.'b'But Americans should feel some limited sympathy for the late king, because our relationship with his kingdom has something in common with his own. Like so many despots, Abdullah was to some extent a prisoner of the system he inherited, interested in reform in theory but unable to find the room or take the risks required to see it through. And we in the United States are prisoners as well: handcuffed to Saudi Arabia, bound to its corruptions and repression, with no immediate possibility of escape.'b'Much of America\xe2\x80\x99s post-Cold War policy-making in the Middle East can be understood as a search for a way to slip those cuffs. Three consecutive presidents have tried to reshape the region so that alliances with despotic regimes will no longer seem so inevitable or necessary. And all of them have failed.'b'For Bill Clinton, solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was supposed to be the catalyst \xe2\x80\x94 in ways never quite elucidated \xe2\x80\x94 for reform and progress in the wider Arab world. For George W. Bush, or at least his ambitious advisers, the invasion of Iraq was supposed to create a brilliant alternative to our Saudi alliance \xe2\x80\x94 a new special Middle Eastern relationship, but with an oil-producing liberal democracy this time.'b'For President Obama, there have been multiple ideas for how we might, as an administration official put it during our Libya campaign, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'realign our interests and our values'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d The president has tried rhetorical outreach to transcend (or at least obscure) our coziness with tyrants; he tried, in Libya and haltingly in Egypt, to put his administration on the side of the Arab Spring; he and Mr. Kerry have made efforts to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process; he has sought some kind of realigning deal with that other font of cruelty, the Islamic Republic of Iran.'b'The Iran project is ongoing, but so far all these efforts either have led (in the case of our Libyan crusade) to outright chaos, or have seen things cycle back to the same old stalemates, the same morally corrosive status quo.'b'Here Obama\xe2\x80\x99s experiences are of a piece with Bush\xe2\x80\x99s, albeit without the same cost in blood and treasure. From Saddam\xe2\x80\x99s Iraq to Mubarak\xe2\x80\x99s Egypt, from Libya to the West Bank, the last two presidents have repeatedly pulled the curtain back, or had it pulled back for them, on potential alternatives to the kind of realpolitik that binds us to the Saudis, and potential aftermaths to 'b'the dynasty\xe2\x80\x99s eventual fall'b'. So far, they\xe2\x80\x99ve found nothing good.'b'Meanwhile, the Saudis themselves are still there. And since much of what\xe2\x80\x99s gone bad now surrounds them \xe2\x80\x94 the Islamic State very much in business in the north, Iranian-backed rebels 'b'seizing power in Yemen'b' to the south \xe2\x80\x94 the American interest in the stability of their kingdom, the continuation of the royal family\xe2\x80\x99s corrupt and wicked rule, is if anything even stronger than before.'b'Whatever judgment King Abdullah finds himself facing now, he is at least free of his kingdom, his region and its nightmarish dilemmas.'b'But not America.

Even now, American officials continue to insist that any lasting political solution will require Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s exit. But the unsettling truth is that the brutal dictator is still clinging to power and the United States and its allies are going to have to live with him, at least for now.'b'Mr. Kerry seemed tacitly to acknowledge as much recently when he 'b'urged'b' Mr. Assad to change his policies, while omitting the usual call for him to leave office.'b'In the last year, the situation in Syria has changed quickly and dramatically. The Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, now controls about half the country, while the rebels America counted on to defeat Mr. Assad have become weaker in the face of steady gains by the regime.'b'There seems no chance that Mr. Assad will leave power voluntarily anytime soon or that he will be forced out by the non-ISIS rebels unless the United States intervenes directly, a course President Obama has rejected. Recent history should humble anyone who would predict the direction of regime change. Except for Tunisia, countries that overthrew their leaders during the 2011 Arab Spring movements have replaced the old dictators with new ones or descended into chaos.'b'Besides, the greater threat now is not Mr. Assad but the Islamic State, especially if it continues to expand in Syria, entices more foreign fighters into its ranks and uses its territory to launch attacks on the West. A recent study by the 'b'RAND Corporation'b', which does research for the government, says the collapse of the Assad regime, while unlikely now, would be the \xe2\x80\x9cworst possible outcome\xe2\x80\x9d for American interests \xe2\x80\x94 depriving Syria of its remaining state institutions and creating more space for the Islamic State and other extremists to spread mayhem.'b'This was not the scenario envisioned in 2011 when Syrians staged peaceful protests against Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s autocratic government. President Obama and European leaders called for Mr. Assad to resign and pressured him with sanctions. The dictator, armed and aided by Russia and Iran, retaliated with his air force and barrel bombs, fueling a civil war in which some 200,000 Syrians have been killed and countless towns destroyed.'b'As has long been the case, the fighting in Syria raises tough questions and presents the United States with no good options. And Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s approach to the conflict remains the most inchoate element of his campaign against the Islamic State. While the Americans and Mr. Assad ostensibly share a common enemy, the two parties are not formally collaborating. Yet American fighter planes regularly invade Syrian airspace to bomb Islamic State targets. If the main threat is the Islamic State and the goal is to defeat it, might the West at some point be forced to work with Mr. Assad?'b'The administration says it is training Syrian rebels to assist the United States-led air campaign against the Islamic State, but those fighters will not be engaged for another few months and there are serious doubts about whether they can ever be effective. Figuring out Syria\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term future is even more complicated. If, as American officials say, the only way to end the civil war and forge a common front against ISIS is some kind of political agreement that includes Russia and Iran, Mr. Assad\xe2\x80\x99s major allies, and Turkey and Saudi Arabia, his major opponents, what must Washington do to strengthen its position and shape the outcome?'b'American officials see an emerging international consensus on the need for a long-term diplomatic solution between Mr. Assad and diverse rebel groups. There is also interest in United Nations-led cease-fires in local communities like Aleppo that might serve as a basis for a broader peace. As The Times has reported, the Russians are trying to bring the two sides into talks 'b'later this month'b', with the apparent aim of a more gradual change in Syria.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how plausible any of the ideas are, and no one seems to have figured out how to tie these disparate pieces into a coherent game plan. That includes the Republicans who control Congress and spend their time railing against Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy, though they have offered no realistic alternatives. The idea of a capable force of \xe2\x80\x9cmoderate\xe2\x80\x9d Syrians that can overthrow Mr. Assad has proved to be a fantasy, even though politicians like Senator John McCain keep insisting otherwise.'b'Congress must, of course, have a role in advising how to wage this new war against the Islamic State. But it has shirked its duty, and after months of American military action in Iraq and Syria, it has failed to authorize or even seriously debate how this indefinite war should be conducted.'b'YAMHILL, Ore. \xe2\x80\x94 THE funeral for my high school buddy Kevin Green is Saturday, near this town where we both grew up.'b'The doctors say he died at age 54 of multiple organ failure, but in a deeper sense he died of inequality and a lack of good jobs.'b'Lots of Americans would have seen Kevin \xe2\x80\x94 obese with a huge gray beard, surviving on disability and food stamps \xe2\x80\x94 as a moocher. They would have been harshly judgmental: 'b'Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you look after your health? Why did you father two kids outside of marriage?'b''b'That acerbic condescension reflects one of this country\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental problems: an empathy gap. It reflects the delusion on the part of many affluent Americans that those like Kevin are lazy or living cushy lives. 'b'A poll'b' released this month by the Pew Research Center found that wealthy Americans mostly agree that \xe2\x80\x9cpoor people today have it easy because they can get government benefits without doing anything in return.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lazy? Easy? Kevin used to set out with his bicycle and a little trailer to collect cans by the roadside. He would make about $20 a day.'b'Let me tell you about Kevin Green. He grew up on a small farm a couple of miles from my family\xe2\x80\x99s, and we both attended the same small rural high school in Yamhill, Ore. We both ran cross country, took welding and agriculture classes and joined Future Farmers of America. After cross country practice, I\xe2\x80\x99d drive him home to his family farm, with its milk cows, hogs and chickens.'b'The Greens encapsulated if not the American dream, at least solid upward mobility. The dad, Thomas, had only a third-grade education and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t read. But he had a good union job as a cement finisher, paying far above the minimum wage, and he worked hard and made sure his kids did, too. He had no trouble with the law.'b'Kevin and his big sister, Cindy \xe2\x80\x94 one of the sweetest girls in school \xe2\x80\x94 both earned high school diplomas. Kevin was sunny, cheerful and astonishingly helpful: Any hint that something needed fixing, and he was there with a wrench. But then the dream began to disintegrate.'b'The local glove factory and feed store closed, and other blue-collar employers cut back. Good union jobs became hard to find. For a while, Kevin had a low-paying nonunion job working for a construction company. After that company went under, he worked as shift manager making trailer homes. He fell in love and had twin boys that he doted on. But because he and his girlfriend struggled financially, they never married.'b'Then, about 15 years ago, Kevin hurt his back and was laid off. Soon afterward, his girlfriend moved out, took the kids and asked for child support. The loss of his girlfriend, kids and job was a huge blow.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt knocked him to the dirt,\xe2\x80\x9d says his younger brother, Clayton, also a pal of mine. \xe2\x80\x9cIt destroyed his self-esteem.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s weight ballooned to 350 pounds, and he developed diabetes and had a couple of heart attacks. He grew marijuana and self-medicated with it, Clayton says, and was arrested for drug offenses.'b'My kids would see Kevin and me together and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe he had run cross country with me, and that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t 20 years older.'b'Kevin eventually got disability benefits, but he was far behind in child support and was punished by losing his driver\xe2\x80\x99s license \xe2\x80\x94 which made it pretty much impossible to get a job in a rural area. Disability helped Kevin by providing a monthly check that he desperately needed, but it also hurt him because he might have looked harder for a job if he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been getting those checks, Clayton says.'b'Yet it\xe2\x80\x99s absurd to think that people like Kevin are somehow living it up. After child support deductions, he was living on about $180 a month plus food stamps and a small income from selling home-grown pot. He supplemented this by growing a huge vegetable garden and fishing in the Yamhill River.'b'Three years ago, Cindy died of a heart attack at 52. Then doctors told Kevin a few weeks ago that his heart, liver and kidneys were failing, and that he was dying. He had trouble walking. He was in pain.'b'He was also worried about his twin boys. They had trouble in school and with the law, jailed for drug and other offenses. The upward mobility that had seemed so promising a generation ago turned out to be a mirage. Family structure dissolved, and lives become grueling \xe2\x80\x94 and shorter.'b'Kevin wrote a will a few days before he died. He bequeathed his life\xe2\x80\x99s savings of $3,500 to his mom for his funeral expenses. Anything left over is to be divided between his children \xe2\x80\x94 and he begs them not to fight over it. His ashes will be sprinkled on the farm.'b'I have trouble diagnosing just what went wrong in that odyssey from sleek distance runner to his death at 54, but the lack of good jobs was central to it. Sure, Kevin made mistakes, but his dad had opportunities for good jobs that Kevin never had.'b'So, Kevin Green, R.I.P. You were a good man \xe2\x80\x94 hardworking and always on the lookout for someone to help \xe2\x80\x94 yet you were overturned by 'b'riptides of inequality'b'. Those who would judge you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a clue. They could use a dose of your own empathy.'b'IN \xe2\x80\x9cRomeo and Juliet,\xe2\x80\x9d the young Miss Capulet poses one of literature\xe2\x80\x99s most famous questions: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in a name?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When it comes to a street name, the answer is: a lot.'b'Street names tell stories. They tell us if a neighborhood is expensive or affordable, brand-new or decades old. With street names alone, we can uncover all kinds of insights.'b'This might seem surprising, especially given the relatively random process by which streets get their names. A real-estate developer might come up with a motif that seems relevant to a particular place, or just an arbitrary theme \xe2\x80\x94 Caribbean, equestrian, or United States presidents. Some developers hold competitions among employees and then pick the winning names. The local government usually takes a look at the resulting map, just to make sure the names won\xe2\x80\x99t confuse mail carriers or ambulance drivers. And that\xe2\x80\x99s about it.'b'But if you look at enough data, patterns start to emerge. Even randomness has an order.'b'Turning to the same database we use to estimate and analyze home values, we looked at years of data about sales and listings. We learned three things about the relationship between home values and street names: First, names are better than numbers. Second, lanes are better than streets. Third, unusual names are better than common ones.'b'Imagine that one of us (Spencer) lives on 10th Street and the other (Stan) lives on Elm Street. With only this information, we can guess that Stan\xe2\x80\x99s house is probably worth more than Spencer\xe2\x80\x99s. On average, homes on named streets are 2 percent more valuable than those on numbered streets. (We looked only at single-family homes, condos and co-ops. Large apartment buildings \xe2\x80\x94 especially in New York City \xe2\x80\x94 would skew the data.)'b'For some cities, this named-street premium is higher \xe2\x80\x94 greater than 20 percent on average in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Riverside, Calif., and San Francisco. We found only three cities where named streets don\xe2\x80\x99t have the upper hand. In Atlanta and New York, named and numbered streets are roughly equal. Denver is the sole city where numbered streets are more valuable.'b'Next we looked at street suffixes \xe2\x80\x94 the \xe2\x80\x9croads,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdrives\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cboulevards\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and found that, for instance, homes on \xe2\x80\x9cWashington Street\xe2\x80\x9d are usually different from homes on \xe2\x80\x9cWashington Court.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For one thing, a house on Washington Street is probably older. Different street suffixes were popular at different moments. \xe2\x80\x9cStreets\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cavenues\xe2\x80\x9d were stylish in the 1950s, \xe2\x80\x9cways,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccircles\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccourts\xe2\x80\x9d in the late \xe2\x80\x9980s.'b'Street suffixes also offer clues about the size of their neighborhood. Boulevards and avenues include the most homes on average, while courts and lanes include the fewest.'b'Most significant, suffixes have a lot to say about home prices. Homes on \xe2\x80\x9cstreets\xe2\x80\x9d are almost always among the least valuable. If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a higher-value home, you\xe2\x80\x99re much more likely to find it on a \xe2\x80\x9cway\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cplace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Which brings us to our third rule: You should also look at streets with uncommon names.'b'Nationally, the most common street names tend to have the lowest home values. Look at Main Street. It\xe2\x80\x99s by far the most common street name in America. It\xe2\x80\x99s also the least valuable. Main Street homes are worth, on average, about 4 percent less than America\xe2\x80\x99s median.'b'On the other side of the spectrum are \xe2\x80\x9cLake\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSunset.\xe2\x80\x9d Homes on \xe2\x80\x9cLake\xe2\x80\x9d average 16 percent more than the national median home value, and \xe2\x80\x9cSunset\xe2\x80\x9d houses are a close second.'b'We aren\xe2\x80\x99t recommending that you start a petition to rename your street. Correlation is not causation. Homes on \xe2\x80\x9cLake\xe2\x80\x9d aren\xe2\x80\x99t more valuable because of the name; generally they\xe2\x80\x99re more valuable because the descriptive name reflects a truth about the real estate. In this case, they\xe2\x80\x99re probably next to \xe2\x80\x94 you guessed it \xe2\x80\x94 a lake.'b'And of course, all of these rules reflect broad national trends. There are plenty of exceptions; like politics, all home values, trends and characteristics are local.'b'No matter where you look, however, street names have meaning. They are artifacts from a neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s genesis, bearing data that we finally can uncover.'b'Just a few years ago, real estate information was guarded in county courthouses and secret databases. Shopping for a home was like being in a dark room. An agent might shine a flashlight on two or three homes \xe2\x80\x94 but all you wanted was to flip the switch and see it all for yourself. Today, real estate information is more transparent and democratized; the connection between street names and home values is only the beginning. Buying, selling, renting, regulating and financing all have been illuminated.'b'ARE you confused by sex? I certainly am.'b'One of the many reasons sex is puzzling is that we lack reliable data. People lie to friends, lovers, doctors, surveys and themselves.'b'Three years ago, when I was a graduate student in economics, I began to write about how new data, particularly Google searches, could give us fresh insights into socially sensitive topics. Since then, many people have asked me to write about sex.'b'I was wary because I wanted to do more research. Now I\xe2\x80\x99m finally ready to report. Call it everything you always wanted to know about sex, but didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the data to ask.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the basics. How much sex are we having? Traditional surveys are no good at answering this question.'b'I analyzed data from the General Social Survey, a classic source. Heterosexual men 18 and over say that they average 63 sex acts per year, using a condom in 23 percent of them. This adds up to more than 1.6 billion heterosexual condom uses per year.'b'Heterosexual women say they average 55 sex acts per year, using a condom in 16 percent of them. This adds up to about 1.1 billion heterosexual condom uses per year.'b'Who is telling the truth, men or women?'b'Neither. According to Nielsen, fewer than 600 million condoms are sold every year.'b'Americans may also be exaggerating how often they have unprotected sex. About 11 percent of women between the ages of 15 and 44 say they are sexually active, not currently pregnant and not using contraception. Even with relatively conservative assumptions about how many times they are having sex, we would expect 10 percent to become pregnant every month. But this would already be more than the total number of pregnancies in the United States (which is one in 113 women of childbearing age).'b'Men who have never been married claim to average 29 condom uses per year. This is more than the total number of condoms sold in the United States to married and single people combined.'b'Married people probably exaggerate how much sex they have, too. On average, married men under 65 tell surveys they have sex once a week. Only 1 percent say they have gone the past year without sex. Married women say there is a little less sex but not much less.'b'Google searches give a far less lively picture of sex during marriage.'b'On Google, the top complaint about a marriage is not having sex. Searches for \xe2\x80\x9csexless marriage\xe2\x80\x9d are three and a half times more common than \xe2\x80\x9cunhappy marriage\xe2\x80\x9d and eight times more common than \xe2\x80\x9cloveless marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d There are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk.'b'Even couples not yet married complain somewhat frequently about lack of sex. Google searches for \xe2\x80\x9csexless relationship\xe2\x80\x9d are second only to searches for \xe2\x80\x9cabusive relationship.\xe2\x80\x9d (Abusive relationships are obviously a very important topic that I will return to in the future.)'b'On Google, there are five and a half times more complaints about an unmarried partner not wanting sex than an unmarried partner refusing to text back. There are more complaints that a boyfriend \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t have sex\xe2\x80\x9d than that a \xe2\x80\x9cgirlfriend\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t. Complaints about \xe2\x80\x9chusbands\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwives\xe2\x80\x9d are roughly equal. (One quick point about sexuality. I am assuming that a large majority of searches with \xe2\x80\x9cmy girlfriend\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmy wife\xe2\x80\x9d are by men. In 'b'a previous article'b', I argued that more men are gay than surveys suggest and that the closet remains a cause of huge amounts of secret suffering. But I also found that about 95 percent of men are heterosexual.) Taken altogether, the data suggest that Americans manage to have sex about 30 times per year \xe2\x80\x94 or once every 12 days.'b'Sex can be quite fun. Why do we have so little of it?'b'Google searches suggest one predominant reason: enormous anxiety, with much of it misplaced.'b'Start with men\xe2\x80\x99s neuroses. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t news that men worry about their genitals, but the degree of this worry is rather profound. From a Google search alone, we cannot know the gender of a user. However, we can often make a pretty good guess for searches about sex and body parts, like \xe2\x80\x9cmy penis ____.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Men Google more questions about their sexual organ than any other body part: more than about their lungs, liver, feet, ears, nose, throat and brain combined.'b'Men make more searches asking how to make their penises bigger than how to tune a guitar, make an omelet or change a tire. Men\xe2\x80\x99s top Googled concern about steroids is whether taking them might make their penis smaller. Men\xe2\x80\x99s top Googled question related to how their body or mind changed as they aged was whether their penis got smaller.'b'Side note: One of the more common questions for Google about a penis is \xe2\x80\x9cHow big is my penis?\xe2\x80\x9d That men turn to Google, rather than a ruler, with this question is, in my opinion, a quintessential expression of our digital era.'b'Do women care about penis size? Rarely, according to Google searches. For every search women make about a partner\xe2\x80\x99s phallus, men make roughly 170 searches about their own.'b'TRUE, on the rare occasions women do express concerns about a partner\xe2\x80\x99s penis, it is frequently about its size, but not necessarily that it is small. More than 40 percent of complaints about a partner\xe2\x80\x99s penis size is that it is too big. \xe2\x80\x9cPain\xe2\x80\x9d is the most Googled word used in searches with the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c___ during sex.\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cBleeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpeeing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccrying\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfarting\xe2\x80\x9d round out the top five.)'b'One percent of searches looking to change one\xe2\x80\x99s penis size are seeking information on how to make it smaller.'b'Another major sexual concern is climaxing prematurely. Men\xe2\x80\x99s second-most-common sex question is how to make their sexual encounters longer.'b'Once again, the insecurities of men do not appear to match the concerns of women. There are roughly the same number of searches asking how to make a boyfriend climax more quickly as climax more slowly. In fact, the most common concern women have related to a boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s orgasm isn\xe2\x80\x99t about when it happened but why it isn\xe2\x80\x99t happening at all.'b'We do not often talk about male body insecurity. And while it is true that overall interest in personal appearance skews female, it is not as lopsided as stereotypes would suggest. According to my analysis of Google AdWords (also based on anonymous, aggregate web activity), interest in beauty and fitness is 42 percent male; weight loss is 33 percent male; and cosmetic surgery is 39 percent male. Among all searches with \xe2\x80\x9chow to\xe2\x80\x9d related to breasts, about 20 percent ask how to get rid of man breasts.'b'What can this new data teach us about women\xe2\x80\x99s insecurities? Every year, in the United States, there are more than seven million searches looking into breast implants. Official statistics tell us that about 300,000 women go through with it annually.'b'Women also show a great deal of insecurity about their behinds, although many women have recently flip-flopped on what it is they don\xe2\x80\x99t like about them.'b'In 2004, in some parts of the United States, the most common search regarding changing one\xe2\x80\x99s butt was how to make it smaller. The desire to make one\xe2\x80\x99s bottom bigger was overwhelmingly concentrated in areas with large black populations. Beginning in 2010, however, the desire for bigger butts grew in the rest of the United States. This interest has tripled in four years. In 2014, there were more searches asking how to make your butt bigger than smaller in every state. These days, for every five searches looking into breast implants in the United States, there is one looking into butt implants.'b'Does women\xe2\x80\x99s growing preference for a larger behind match men\xe2\x80\x99s preferences? Interestingly, yes. \xe2\x80\x9cBig butt porn\xe2\x80\x9d searches, which also used to be concentrated in black communities, have recently shot up in popularity throughout the United States.'b'What else do men want in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s body? In the no surprise department, men show a preference for large breasts. About 12 percent of nongeneric pornographic searches are looking for big breasts. This is nearly 20 times higher than the search volume for small-breast porn.'b'That said, it is not clear that this means men want women to get breast implants. About 3 percent of big-breast porn searches explicitly say they want to see natural breasts.'b'Google searches about one\xe2\x80\x99s wife and breast implants are evenly split between asking how to persuade her to get implants and perplexity as to why she wants them.'b'Or consider the most common search about a girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s breasts: \xe2\x80\x9cI love my girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s boobs.\xe2\x80\x9d It is not clear what men are hoping to find from Google when making this search.'b'Women, like men, have questions about their genitals. In fact, they have nearly as many questions about their vaginas as men have about their penises. Women\xe2\x80\x99s worries about their vaginas are often health-related. But at least 30 percent of their questions take up other concerns. Women want to know how to shave it, tighten it and make it taste better. A strikingly common concern is how to improve its odor.'b'Women are most frequently concerned that their vaginas smell like fish, followed by vinegar, onions, ammonia, garlic, cheese, body odor, urine, bread, bleach, feces, sweat, metal, feet, garbage and rotten meat.'b'In general, men do not make many Google searches involving a partner\xe2\x80\x99s genitalia. Men make roughly the same number of searches about a girlfriend\xe2\x80\x99s vagina as women do about a boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s penis.'b'When men do search about a partner\xe2\x80\x99s vagina, it is usually to complain about what women worry about most: the odor. Mostly, men are trying to figure out how to tell a woman about a bad odor without hurting her feelings. Sometimes, however, men\xe2\x80\x99s questions about the odor reveal their own insecurities. Men occasionally ask for ways to use the smell to detect cheating \xe2\x80\x94 if it smells like condoms, for example, or another man\xe2\x80\x99s semen.'b'I know I am obsessed with Google searches and other new data sets. I ask myself all the time whether I am taking it too far. Every researcher, no matter how grounded in data, can let his biases get in the way of the truth. This data is all public. Other researchers will undoubtedly add their own interpretations and ask new questions.'b'Dan Ariely, a psychologist at Duke, offers a reason for caution in interpreting this data. While most data sources underestimate sexual thoughts, he suspects that Google may overestimate them.'b'As Professor Ariely put it, \xe2\x80\x9cGoogle is a reflection of what people don\xe2\x80\x99t know and need extra information about.\xe2\x80\x9d If you want to know how to make omelets, you may just ask a relative. You are less likely to ask your relatives about penis enlargement.'b'Another surprising thing about \xe2\x80\x9cbig data\xe2\x80\x9d is how small it often is. Many people expect that any given Google search will be made millions of times. You may look at the accompanying graphic that includes the total monthly search volumes for various phrases and think, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s it?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'People do not type everything they think into Google. Google data is a small sample of everybody\xe2\x80\x99s thoughts and concerns. It is suggestive, not definitive.'b'I AM hardly an expert on sex. Professionally, I am neither a psychologist nor a sex therapist.'b'But here\xe2\x80\x99s what I think.'b'Just about every study I have done relying on Google searches made me feel worse about the world. Huge numbers of people are racist and sexist; far too many children suffer from unreported abuse. But after studying the new data on sex, I actually feel better.'b'This data makes me feel less lonely. In my previous studies of Google data, I had found the viciousness that humans often hide. But this time around, I have seen our hidden insecurities. Men and women are united in this insecurity and confusion.'b'Google also gives us legitimate reasons to worry less than we do. Many of our deepest fears about how our sexual partners perceive us are unjustified. Alone, at their computers, with no incentive to lie, partners reveal themselves to be fairly nonsuperficial and forgiving. In fact, we are all so busy judging our own bodies that there is little energy left over to judge other people\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Maybe if we worried less about sex, we\xe2\x80\x99d have more of it.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s economy increased at a slower rate in 2014 than in previous years.'b'PARIS \xe2\x80\x94  The typical trajectory of most French Islamist terrorists follows four steps: alienation from the dominant culture, thanks partly to joblessness and discrimination in blighted neighborhoods; a turn to petty crime, which leads to prison, and then more crime and more prison; religious awakening and radicalization; and an initiatory journey to a Muslim country like Syria, Afghanistan or Yemen to train for jihad.'b'Stints in prison were seminal for Ch\xc3\xa9rif Kouachi, Amedy Coulibaly and other major figures of French jihadism in recent years \xe2\x80\x94 Mohammed Merah, Mehdi Nemmouche, Khaled Kelkal \xe2\x80\x94 as both a rite of passage and a gateway to radicalism.'b'Muslims account for about 7-10 percent of 'b'France'b'\xe2\x80\x99s total population but around half of its prison population of 68,000. Muslims are even more numerous in facilities near large cities, particularly in maisons d\xe2\x80\x99arr\xc3\xaat, which hold prisoners serving shorter sentences.'b'Precise figures are unavailable because la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9, France\xe2\x80\x99s strict form of secularism, prohibits officially asking and collecting data about people\xe2\x80\x99s religious preferences. These estimates are based on research I conducted in French prisons in 2000-3 and again in 2011-3, when I interviewed some 160 inmates and many guards, doctors and social workers in four major facilities, some among the largest in Europe. Fifteen of those inmates had been sentenced for terrorist acts.'b'Many Muslims feel marginalized when they get to prison, due to exclusion and bigotry from the white majority in mainstream society, and their own counterracism. Although in urban prisons they are a majority, they continue to feel victimized and trapped. Very few guards are Muslim, and prison officials, who tend to be hypersecular, have little understanding of Islam, for example confusing fundamentalism with extremism.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook at how a Catholic or a Jew is treated, and look at how we are treated,\xe2\x80\x9d Abdelkarim, a Frenchman of Italian origin in his late 20s who was serving a five-year sentence for armed robbery, told me in 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have their weekly prayers; in this prison we don\xe2\x80\x99t have Friday prayers. Their rabbi can go to all the cells; our Muslim minister cannot. There\xe2\x80\x99s kosher food, but no halal meat. They despise us, and they call that la\xc3\xafcit\xc3\xa9.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, Muslim ministers can visit Muslim inmates in their cells but usually don\xe2\x80\x99t do it for lack of time, and halal meat is increasingly available. But such misperceptions are common, and they only reinforce the appeal of Islam as the religion of choice for the stigmatized and the oppressed. Unlike Christianity, it has an anti-Western and anti-imperialist bend.'b'One young French inmate of Algerian origin told me in 2013, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are a Muslim and ask to participate in the Friday prayers, they take your name down and hand it over to the Renseignements G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9raux.\xe2\x80\x9d (The Renseignements G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9raux is the French equivalent of the FBI.) He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIf I try to take my prayer carpet to the courtyard, they prohibit it. If I grow a beard, the guards call me Bin Laden, smiling and mocking me. They hate Islam. But Islam can take revenge!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Adherence to radical Islam is largely the transfer into the spiritual realm of that particular combination of indignation, rancor and wholesale rejection encompassed by the expression, widespread among prisoners, \xe2\x80\x9cavoir la haine\xe2\x80\x9d (to have hate). For some inmates, especially those who were only nominally Muslim and nonpracticing, violent aspirations emerge first, with religiosity \xe2\x80\x94 and often a very approximate understanding of Islam \xe2\x80\x94 grafting itself onto to them later.'b'Abdelkarim, who converted to Islam (and adopted an Arabic name) about a decade before I met him, acted as an informal Salafist chaplain; his prison counted about 1,000 Muslim inmates and just one Muslim minister, an older gentleman from North Africa out of touch with the young prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 concerns. Each time Abdelkarim sang the call to prayer at dawn he would be sent to solitary confinement for a few days; eventually he was transferred to another jail. Nationwide, there is only about one Muslim minister for every 190 inmates, leaving self-proclaimed ulama to proffer their own religious guidance.'b'Radical preaching catches on because it offers young Muslim prisoners a way to escape their predicament and develop a fantasy of omnipotence by declaring death onto their oppressors. During my research in 2000-3, the prisoners idolized Khaled Kelkal, whose network killed eight people in a Paris subway station in 1995 to punish the French government for backing a military coup against an Islamist party in Algeria. A decade later their new icon was Mohammed Merah, who in 2012 shot down seven people, including soldiers and Jewish children, in the name of radical Islam; some inmates even impersonated him. Now the new celebrities will be the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly.'b'About three months ago, the authorities at Fresnes, a very large prison known for its strict discipline, started experimenting with separating suspected Muslim radicals from the general population, grouping them in special cells. Although it is too early to assess the measure\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness, the provisional results are mixed.'b'The prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 segregation at Fresnes is incomplete, owing to the shape of the 19th-century building. With rows of cell blocks branching out perpendicularly from a central corridor, the inmates can communicate with each other simply by shouting. The radicalized prisoners now have less influence on other inmates, especially ones who are impressionable or have mental disorders. But they are in closer contact with one another, allowing them to organize and make plans.'b'Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced recently that the quarantine program would be expanded in several prisons around Paris. The proposal needs to be refined. Seasoned jihadists must be separated from untested radicals and the returnees from, say, Syria and Iraq, who may have been traumatized or disappointed by their experience of jihad and still stand a chance of being reintegrated into mainstream society.'b'More must also be done to address the legitimate claims of Muslim inmates. Collective Friday prayers should be allowed in all French prisons, for example. The government announced last week that 60 Muslim ministers would be trained to supplement the 182 or so currently in service. This is a welcome proposal. But at least three times as many ministers are needed, and they must be more uniformly distributed throughout the prisons. Above all, they will need to be coached to better understand and address the concerns of disaffected young Muslim prisoners.'b'Indeed, reform must begin with respect. For if French prisons have become a breeding ground for radicalism, it is partly because they mistreat the Islamic faith itself.'b''b'\n'b'Farhad Khosrokhavar 'b' is a sociologist at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cRadicalisation.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94  America and 'b'Iran'b' took a step toward a final nuclear deal on Jan. 18, but they should be making leaps. The negotiators have proposed some creative solutions but major political compromises are sorely needed, and soon.'b'If a framework agreement can\xe2\x80\x99t be reached in March, the talks could become mired in stalemate. Those who oppose any diplomacy between Iran and the West are already seeking to end the process altogether. With time, they will gain further ammunition.'b'Spoilers have been striking from Tehran, Washington and Tel Aviv. Some are trying to limit the ability of President 'b'Barack Obama'b' (or whoever succeeds him) to deliver a reasonable sanctions-relief package to Iran. Others are seeking to corner Iran and force its government into knee-jerk reactions to regional flare-ups. Hard-liners in the United States and Iran see the nuclear negotiations as an opportunity to score points domestically and they are escalating their efforts to scuttle a grand bargain.'b'Although the Obama administration has dedicated itself to multilateral diplomacy with Iran, it has been under constant pressure from Congress. Powerful American legislators, influential lobby groups and the Israeli prime minister have repeatedly called for increased economic pressure on Iran to extract further concessions. Not only does this contradict America\xe2\x80\x99s interest in maintaining the freeze on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'nuclear program'b', but it also devalues the agreement brokered between Iran and France, Britain, Russia, China, America and Germany.'b'Threats by American lawmakers to impose further sanctions on Iran have already poisoned the spirit of the talks and created doubt among Iranians about whether the United States is able and willing to deliver on its promises. This has provoked hard-liners in Tehran to respond with their own threats that Iran would increase its enrichment capacity should new sanctions pass.'b'During his 'b'State of the Union address'b', President Obama made clear that he would veto any proposals for additional sanctions on Iran. And although officials in Tehran recognize this as a good faith gesture on the part of Mr. Obama, they also remember that a Congressional bill introduced in late 2013 nearly garnered enough support to withstand a similar veto threat. Iranian officials worry that the Obama administration is constitutionally unable to make a durable and ironclad promise of sanctions relief as part of a final deal. With a Republican majority in both chambers of Congress, and House Speaker John Boehner\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to Prime Minister 'b'Benjamin Netanyahu'b' to address Congress for a third time, Iran fears that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s veto won\xe2\x80\x99t be enough.'b'At the same time, Iran is at risk of losing the West\xe2\x80\x99s trust. There is a danger that Iran will damage its newfound reputation as a good faith interlocutor by retaliating for the presumed Israeli attack that killed Hezbollah operatives and an Iranian general in Syria last Sunday.'b'Iran believes the strike was a premeditated Israeli operation targeting a high-level Iranian official. Influential hardliners in Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s security establishment view it as an act of aggression by 'b'Israel'b' and demand a direct response.'b'But any such retaliation, either overtly by Iran or covertly through Hezbollah, would likely prompt Israel\xe2\x80\x99s European and American allies to halt the nuclear negotiations altogether \xe2\x80\x94 especially if the retaliation involves attacks against civilians.'b'The Iranian government must decide how openly it wishes to involve itself in the inevitable Hezbollah retaliation while ensuring its tactics do not threaten Iran\xe2\x80\x99s long-term strategic objective of securing a nuclear deal. Iran prudently avoided any entanglement in the Gaza conflict over the summer \xe2\x80\x94 and it should continue to keep its distance.'b'If Tehran responds excessively, or if operations are carried out unofficially by Iranian hard-liners, this would escalate the Israeli-Iranian standoff and could derail the nuclear talks completely.'b'March will be an important month for all parties. The results of the Israeli elections could deflate Tel Aviv\xe2\x80\x99s fierce opposition to current negotiations with Iran. For Mr. Netanyahu, blocking any nuclear deal is a personal investment. Some of his political rivals do not necessarily share his fervor on the issue. They view a nuclear deal as less of a threat and place more value on maintaining Israel\xe2\x80\x99s strong alliances with European nations and the United States, all of whom seek a nuclear deal with Iran. If Mr. Netanyahu is defeated by a less hawkish opponent, the Obama administration will have an easier time reassuring Israel about any deal with Iran and there would also be less Israeli pressure on Congress.'b'March is also symbolic for Mr. Rouhani, who is eager to mark the Iranian New Year with a psychological shift on sanctions and engagement with the West. This would be a timely electoral boost for moderates seeking to strengthen their position in the upcoming parliamentary elections.'b'After the negotiations were extended for a second time in November, Mr. Rouhani appealed to the Iranian people, other political factions and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Leader for hope and patience. They granted his request but they will not tolerate talks that continue to be extended indefinitely with no tangible sanctions relief in sight.'b'The extension of negotiations has prevented a return to hostile rhetoric between Iran and the West. But tepid progress without any major concessions is a blessing for spoilers, who will use the additional time to sabotage diplomacy.'b'Iran must not allow its short-term ideological pursuits in the region to jeopardize its overarching strategic objective: achieving a comprehensive nuclear deal that brings sanctions relief and provides Iran the option of having a functional relationship with the West.'b'Likewise, the United States must not allow a myopic and obstructionist Congress to derail a deal that is in Washington\xe2\x80\x99s long-term interest and strengthens global security.'b''b'\n'b'Ellie Geranmayeh 'b' is a policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

After a tense, week-long negotiation between a special committee and the minister of the economy, Emmanuel Macron, the National Assembly will begin debate Monday on whether department stores and shops will be allowed to open more often on what has been a traditional day of rest.'b'During his presidential campaign in 2012, 'b'Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande'b' lambasted the Right for its efforts to transform Sunday into a day like any other, devoted to business and material gain. The great battle of 2012, he declared, was over \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle of Sunday as a day of rest, one that workers can devote to sport, to family, culture and to liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d If elected, Mr. Hollande promised, he \xe2\x80\x9cwould keep vigil\xe2\x80\x9d over this sacrosanct day.'b'After three years of political disarray, economic malaise and mounting unemployment, however, Mr. Hollande has grown increasingly desperate. In mid-December, his treasury minister, Mr. Macron, offered a battery of legislation that seeks to liberalize some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s laws governing commerce and the liberal professions. One proposal in particular drew the ire of Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s Socialist party rank-and-file, not to mention the Communists: The proposed law would allow stores or businesses to open 12 Sundays a year rather than just the five now permitted.'b'The Socialist dissident Martine Aubry published an opinion article in Le Monde that appeared the same day the government rolled out its legislation. Architect of the 35-hour week, a signature achievement of the Socialists introduced in 2000, Ms. Aubry dwelt on the meaning of the Sunday law. It is, she claimed, \xe2\x80\x9ca moment of truth speaking to the one question that truly matters: What kind of society do we want to live in?\xe2\x80\x9d Is this, she wondered, all the Left has left to offer: \xe2\x80\x9cA Sunday stroll in a shopping mall and the accumulation of consumer goods?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jean-Luc M\xc3\xa9lenchon, a fiery leftist, was even more categorical.

As one cleric explained, the church has joined the Communists for social as well as religious reasons. Rallying to the support of the Socialist Mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who also opposes the new law, Cardinal Andr\xc3\xa9 Vingt-Trois reminded his flock that France\xe2\x80\x99s economic difficulties, though great, do not justify ignoring the benefits of \xe2\x80\x9ca common day of rest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The French have long had conflicted feelings about Sundays. In the early 1950s, the singer Juliette Greco \xe2\x80\x94 one of the muses for French existentialists \xe2\x80\x94 made her reputation with \xe2\x80\x9cI Hate Sundays.\xe2\x80\x9d While she derides Sunday as dead time, made for funerals and the hollow rites of the bourgeoisie, Greco also praises Sunday as the day for making love, not things.'b'Decidedly, as the French psychiatrist Serge Hefez notes: \xe2\x80\x9cSundays are engraved in the French psyche.\xe2\x80\x9d But the day is also engraved in France\xe2\x80\x99s history. During the last decades of the 19th century, French workers, laboring 10 hours a day, seven days a week, repeatedly went on strike to win a day of rest. In 1906, the government grudgingly conceded Sundays as a day of repose, hoping that if workers spent more time at home they would spend less time drinking in cafes. By the end of World War I, Sunday had taken root in the French cultural landscape \xe2\x80\x94 so much so that, in a 2008 poll, 84 percent declared that it was \xe2\x80\x9cimportant, indeed primordial, for family, cultural and religious life that Sunday remain the day of common rest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pirouetting 180 degrees, Mr. Hollande, who had insisted Sunday was a day of republican repose, now dismisses it as a relic of an earlier age. Hammering at the same speaking points as Mr. Macron and Prime Minister Manuel Valls, President Hollande touts the liberty not to rest if one prefers to work (with greater pay, he always adds).'b'There is no clear consensus on the proposed law\xe2\x80\x99s economic payoff. But one suspects that such concerns are secondary for both sides. Instead, traditionalists and modernizers are wrestling over a symbol \xe2\x80\x94 no small matter in a nation that, from the taking of the Bastille to the making of \xe2\x80\x9cJe suis Charlie,\xe2\x80\x9d understands the importance of political emblems.'b'As if to emphasize this very point, the marathon meeting between the Assembly representatives and Macron reached the finish line ... last Sunday.

The 'b'article'b', by Michael Moss, examines the little-known U.S. Meat Animal Research Center, financed by American taxpayers, which employs the sophisticated tools and scientific expertise of modern animal management \xe2\x80\x94 apparently without a conscience.'b'The details Mr. Moss\xe2\x80\x99s article exposes are sickening. In engineering animals to maximize industry\xe2\x80\x99s bottom line, the center, at a sprawling, secluded site in Nebraska, has created pigs that bear freakishly large litters of frail piglets, which are often crushed by their mothers. Cows give birth to triplets, many of them deformed. Lambs are born in open fields, where they starve, are eaten by predators and are overcome by the elements. These so-called easy-care sheep are bred to eliminate the need for shelters and human help at birthing time.'b'How does the consumer benefit from the center\xe2\x80\x99s research? Lower prices, as well as bigger lamb chops, leaner pork loins and more tender steaks. The cost to taxpayers of the research at the center seems negligible \xe2\x80\x94 its budget was $22.7 million in 2014. But the cost borne by animals, in pain and suffering, is clearly horrific.'b'American consumers have steadily grown more aware of the ruthless excesses of industrial agriculture. Animal-rights advocates have toiled for years exposing things the industry does not want customers to know. Some reforms have taken hold; federal laws have improved the treatment of livestock since Upton Sinclair wrote of the horrors done to animals in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Jungle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the conditions of industrial feedlots and factory farms \xe2\x80\x94 the confinement of animals, the rampant use of antibiotics, the manure lagoons \xe2\x80\x94 would shock anyone who na\xc3\xafvely imagines farms as bucolic places out of children\xe2\x80\x99s books. And while the federal Animal Welfare Act seeks to limit suffering, it does not regulate farm animals used in agricultural research. The Agriculture Department rigorously oversees conditions at slaughterhouses and private labs, but as Mr. Moss wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cit does not closely monitor the center\xe2\x80\x99s use of animals, or even enforce its own rules requiring careful scrutiny of experiments.\xe2\x80\x9d (Reuters has reported that the secretary of agriculture, in the wake of Mr. Moss\xe2\x80\x99s article, has directed the agency to create a new animal welfare plan, which will involve employee training and a review of research practices.)'b'The humans who work at the center are not necessarily oblivious to its failings.

I, however, was fuming.'b'Now, don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong: If indeed my son matched the description of a suspect, I would have had no problem with him being questioned appropriately. School is his community, his home away from home, and he would have appreciated reasonable efforts to keep it safe. The stop is not the problem; the method of the stop is the problem.'b'Why was a gun drawn first? Why was he not immediately told why he was being detained? Why not ask for ID first?'b'What if my son had panicked under the stress, having never had a gun pointed at him before, and made what the officer considered a \xe2\x80\x9csuspicious\xe2\x80\x9d movement? Had I come close to losing him? Triggers cannot be unpulled. Bullets cannot be called back.'b'My son was unarmed, possessed no plunder, obeyed all instructions, answered all questions, did not attempt to flee or resist in any way.'b'This is the scenario I have always dreaded: my son at the wrong end of a gun barrel, face down on the concrete. I had always dreaded the moment that we would share stories about encounters with the police in which our lives hung in the balance, intergenerational stories of joining the inglorious \xe2\x80\x9cclub.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When that moment came, I was exceedingly happy I had talked to him about how to conduct himself if a situation like this ever occurred. Yet I was brewing with sadness and anger that he had to use that advice.'b'I am reminded of what I have always known, but what some would choose to deny: that there is no way to work your way out \xe2\x80\x94 earn your way out \xe2\x80\x94 of this sort of crisis.

All of our boys are bound together.'b'The dean of Yale College and the campus police chief have apologized and promised an internal investigation, and I appreciate that. But the scars cannot be unmade. My son will always carry the memory of the day he left his college library and an officer trained a gun on him.'b'Framed portraits of the Venezuelan leader Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez were propped up at various stops of President Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro\xe2\x80\x99s recent whirlwind trip abroad, as the man at the helm of the nation with the world\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'largest oil reserves'b' begged for bailouts.'b'Posters of his predecessor also abounded when Mr. Maduro, a former bus driver, arrived home to a carnival-like welcome, as he drove the lead coach of a convoy that snaked through crowds of supporters.'b'Last week, in a speech before lawmakers, Mr. Maduro, whose approval rating has slipped to 'b'22 percent'b' as the Venezuelan economy teeters on the brink of collapse, again invoked his mentor in predicting a landslide victory in upcoming parliamentary elections. \xe2\x80\x9cI have no doubt that Ch\xc3\xa1vez\xe2\x80\x99s nation will deliver a great victory in the memory of Hugo Ch\xc3\xa1vez in elections that are being held this year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Since he was voted into office in April 2013 by a minuscule margin after Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez\xe2\x80\x99s death, Mr. Maduro has leaned heavily on the legacy of his predecessor, a populist who governed poorly but had magnetic charisma and shrewd political instincts. Woefully lacking on both fronts, Mr. Maduro has become increasingly erratic and despotic in a quest for political survival that seems more daunting by the day. Healthy oil export revenue allowed Mr. Ch\xc3\xa1vez to build a robust network of patronage and create generous welfare programs during his 14 years in power. Those are becoming increasingly paltry on Mr. Maduro\xe2\x80\x99s watch.'b'The tumbling price of oil, which accounts for 95 percent of Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s export earnings, has nearly destroyed an economy that has been managed dismally for years. Inflation rose to 64 percent last year. On Wednesday, the International Monetary Fund 'b'predicted'b' that Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s economy would contract 7 percent in 2015, which could force Mr. Maduro\xe2\x80\x99s government to default on its loans or significantly curtail the subsidized oil his country provides to allies in the Caribbean, including Cuba.'b'Mr. Maduro has been vague about the type of painful economic measures his government has been willing to embrace, yet he bafflingly has promised to expand social programs and raise salaries. Far from acknowledging responsibility for the crisis, he and his loyalists have blamed the revenue shortfalls on political opponents they accuse of enabling an international conspiracy.'b'They have jailed one of the most prominent figures in the opposition, Leopoldo L\xc3\xb3pez, since last February on trumped up charges of stoking violent protests a year ago. During Mr. L\xc3\xb3pez\xe2\x80\x99s Kafkaesque trial, which is still in process, prosecutors have argued that he instigated bloodshed through subliminal messages.'b'Last month, the authorities in Venezuela charged another opposition leader, Mar\xc3\xada Corina Machado, with 'b'plotting to assassinate Mr. Maduro'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a ludicrous, unfounded allegation against another inspiring challenger.'b'The crackdown on the opposition, unobstructed by a weak and compromised press, appears to be an effort to divert attention from Venezuelans\xe2\x80\x99 deteriorating quality of life. Security forces have been deployed to maintain order outside supermarkets, where people line up for hours to scrounge whatever is left on depleted shelves.'b'On a recent afternoon, a Venezuelan woman who had been waiting in line since 4 a.m. showed a television journalist from Al Jazeera English her forearm, where someone had written the number 413 with a black marker to establish her place in line. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we are like cattle,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman lamented. \xe2\x80\x9cThis must end.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hours later, Mr. Maduro\xe2\x80\x99s government responded with its standard effort to find a scapegoat for the national calamity. The head of the National Assembly, Diosdado Cabello, in a televised address, called the journalist, M\xc3\xb3nica Villamizar, an American spy.'b'Alexis Tsipras, leader of the left-wing Syriza coalition, is about to become prime minister of Greece. He will be the first European leader elected on an explicit promise to challenge the austerity policies that have prevailed since 2010. And there will, of course, be many people warning him to abandon that promise, to behave \xe2\x80\x9cresponsibly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So how has that responsibility thing worked out so far?'b'To understand the political earthquake in Greece, it helps to look at Greece\xe2\x80\x99s May 2010 \xe2\x80\x9cstandby arrangement\xe2\x80\x9d with the International Monetary Fund, under which the so-called troika \xe2\x80\x94 the I.M.F., the European Central Bank and the European Commission \xe2\x80\x94 extended loans to the country in return for a combination of austerity and reform. It\xe2\x80\x99s a remarkable document, in the worst way. The troika, while pretending to be hardheaded and realistic, was peddling an economic fantasy. And the Greek people have been paying the price for those elite delusions.'b'You see, the economic projections that accompanied the standby arrangement assumed that Greece could impose harsh austerity with little effect on growth and employment. Greece was already in recession when the deal was reached, but the projections assumed that this downturn would end soon \xe2\x80\x94 that there would be only a small contraction in 2011, and that by 2012 Greece would be recovering. Unemployment, the projections conceded, would rise substantially, from 9.4 percent in 2009 to almost 15 percent in 2012, but would then begin coming down fairly quickly.'b'What actually transpired was an economic and human nightmare. Far from ending in 2011, the Greek recession gathered momentum. Greece didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit the bottom until 2014, and by that point it had experienced a full-fledged depression, with overall unemployment rising to 28 percent and youth unemployment rising to almost 60 percent. And the recovery now underway, such as it is, is barely visible, offering no prospect of returning to precrisis living standards for the foreseeable future.'b'What went wrong? I fairly often encounter assertions to the effect that Greece didn\xe2\x80\x99t carry through on its promises, that it failed to deliver the promised spending cuts. Nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, Greece imposed savage cuts in public services, wages of government workers and social benefits. Thanks to repeated further waves of austerity, public spending was cut much more than the original program envisaged, and it\xe2\x80\x99s currently about 20 percent lower than it was in 2010.'b'Yet Greek debt troubles are if anything worse than before the program started. One reason is that the economic plunge has reduced revenues: The Greek government is collecting a substantially higher share of G.D.P. in taxes than it used to, but G.D.P. has fallen so quickly that the overall tax take is down. Furthermore, the plunge in G.D.P. has caused a key fiscal indicator, the ratio of debt to G.D.P., to keep rising even though debt growth has slowed and Greece received some modest debt relief in 2012.'b'Why were the original projections so wildly overoptimistic? As I said, because supposedly hardheaded officials were in reality engaged in fantasy economics. Both the European Commission and the European Central Bank decided to believe in the confidence fairy \xe2\x80\x94 that is, to claim that the direct job-destroying effects of spending cuts would be more than made up for by a surge in private-sector optimism. The I.M.F. was more cautious, but it nonetheless grossly underestimated the damage austerity would do.'b'And here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: If the troika had been truly realistic, it would have acknowledged that it was demanding the impossible. Two years after the Greek program began, the I.M.F. looked for historical examples where Greek-type programs, attempts to pay down debt through austerity without major debt relief or inflation, had been successful. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t find any.'b'So now that Mr. Tsipras has won, and won big, European officials would be well advised to skip the lectures calling on him to act responsibly and to go along with their program. The fact is they have no credibility; the program they imposed on Greece never made sense. It had no chance of working.'b'If anything, the problem with Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s plans may be that they\xe2\x80\x99re not radical enough. Debt relief and an easing of austerity would reduce the economic pain, but it\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful whether they are sufficient to produce a strong recovery. On the other hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear what more any Greek government can do unless it\xe2\x80\x99s prepared to abandon the euro, and the Greek public isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready for that.'b'Still, in calling for a major change, Mr. Tsipras is being far more realistic than officials who want the beatings to continue until morale improves. The rest of Europe should give him a chance to end his country\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'In a Safer Age, U.S. Rethinks Its \xe2\x80\x98Tough on Crime\xe2\x80\x99 System'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news analysis, front page, Jan. 14) doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mention a crucial piece of the public safety puzzle: What constitutes safety?'b'As the article notes, rates of crime have been falling in the United States, and abroad, for decades. The reasons for the drop are complicated, but we do know with certainty that the American policy of mass incarceration has failed to deliver on its public safety promise.'b'We also know that community safety has been undermined by excessive policing and the disproportionate incarceration of minority men. African-American and Latino communities continue to experience higher rates of justice involvement and victimization. For example, African-Americans, Latinos and whites engage in similar levels of drug use \xe2\x80\x94 behavior that is most likely to come to the attention of law enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 but minority communities are incarcerated at much higher levels\xc2\xa0than whites for drug crimes.'b'Both sides of the political aisle have been moving away from tough-on-crime policies because of the growing awareness of the failures and long-term costs of incarceration. The short-term costs of incarcerating a young person can run into the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, while the long-term costs associated with youth incarceration could cost taxpayers $8 billion to $21 billion a year.'b'To change this picture, we have to do more than just curb costs. We have to change laws, policies and practices that lead to too many people experiencing the prison and justice system, and invest in the success of the communities most affected by crime to advance community safety.'b'JASON ZIEDENBERG'b'\nDirector of Policy and Research'b'\nJustice Policy Institute'b'\nWashington, Jan. 14, 2015'b''b''b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Why Drugs Cost So Much'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 15):'b'Peter B.

In fact, according to a new 'b'Tufts study'b', it takes $2.6 billion and up to 15 years to deliver a new medicine to patients. Yet nearly 90 percent of medicines prescribed are generic, at pennies compared with their initial price. This is the only part of the American health care system where prices come down over time.'b'As for the claim that \xe2\x80\x9cwe can see the answer in Europe\xe2\x80\x9d: the Rarer Cancers Forum in Britain says 'b'rationing in Europe has led to the denial of drugs to cancer patients'b' that could have extended their lives.'b'Dr. Bach is right that medicines account for just 10 percent of American health care spending: the same as it was in 1960 and will be in 10 years, as estimated by the federal government.'b'We would all do better to concentrate on the other 90 percent, which represents the primary drivers of health care spending.'b'JOHN J.

Bach explains the exorbitant price of drugs from an insurance perspective. But there is another, more complicated reason drug prices will remain high, even in the face of competition: the intersection between the Food and Drug Administration approval process and patents.'b'Because all new drugs must be shepherded throughout enormously costly \xe2\x80\x94 and unpredictable \xe2\x80\x94 clinical trials, drug companies spend many multiples of the cost of a single clinical trial simply to ensure that one drug, among many, will eventually receive F.D.A. approval.'b'Competition from generic companies, which do not need to suffer through clinical trials to have their drugs approved, only worsens this calculus. As a result, drug companies find refuge in protecting their drugs through patents, which, when successful, give them de facto monopolies, and the pricing to match, on particular treatments.'b'Equilibrating research incentives with F.D.A. approval and patent protection is an enormously complex task.

She just had to keep an eye out for the opportunity.'b'And to my delight, in six months she had a new best woman friend and a male companion!'b'JANE SESKIN'b'\nNew York, Jan. 18, 2015'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'The writer, a clinical social worker, is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cWitness to Resilience: Stories of Intimate Violence.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Jennifer Weiner\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother sounds spirited, energetic and kind. She can create her own \xe2\x80\x9cin group,\xe2\x80\x9d where only kind women are welcome.'b'MAREA WEXLER'b'\nNorthampton, Mass., Jan. 20, 2015'b''b'Nearly a decade ago, Mayor Michael Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s administration 'b'declared'b' \xe2\x80\x9ca new era of solid waste stewardship,\xe2\x80\x9d a veritable trash Enlightenment, when it adopted a plan that would handle New York City\xe2\x80\x99s garbage for the next 20 years. The plan was built on the reasonable and fair idea that each borough needed to take adequate responsibility for its own trash.'b'That era hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite arrived \xe2\x80\x94 it awaits the completion of one key element, a marine transfer station on the East River in Manhattan, near 91st Street and York Avenue, where trash will be unloaded from trucks onto barges for shipment out of state. Nobody loves a floating dump, but this station has met ferocious opposition from Upper East Side residents alarmed by the prospect of noise, fumes, congestion and traffic accidents. The resistance continues, even though the station is well underway; hard hats and cranes are digging and lifting and are expected to be done by late 2016 or early 2017.'b'The Bloomberg plan was a good one, and still is. Mayor Bill de Blasio deserves credit for sticking with it under pressure. Fairness in this case trumps not-in-my-backyardism. And Yorkville and East Harlem are not doomed.'b'But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that the worries are incomprehensible or that the plan can\xe2\x80\x99t be improved. The road to the bridge to the station, over the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, cuts right through the middle of an athletic center called Asphalt Green, which is used by many schoolchildren. It\xe2\x80\x99s an unsettling juxtaposition \xe2\x80\x94 a continual stream of garbage trucks so close to little children\xe2\x80\x99s swimming lessons and soccer games, and a toddlers\xe2\x80\x99 playground.'b'The city says that it has the situation well in hand: that sidewalks and turn lanes will be carefully designed for maximal safety, and a person will actually be stationed at the corner to direct trucks and keep pedestrians safe.'b'Opponents are not placated. Asphalt Green hired Samuel Schwartz, an engineer and a former city traffic commissioner, to come up with something better, which he did: a plan to shift the access to the station a block north, using a service road of the F.D.R. Drive, so that garbage trucks go around and behind \xe2\x80\x94 instead of through \xe2\x80\x94 Asphalt Green. It\xe2\x80\x99s an intriguing idea that could go a long way toward making parents and children breathe easier. The city\xe2\x80\x99s sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, says her agency is looking at Mr. Schwartz\xe2\x80\x99s plan, with engineers calculating its costs and feasibility. A decision is expected in a few weeks.'b'The city should seriously consider the benefits of Mr. Schwartz\xe2\x80\x99s idea, for increased safety and for the station\xe2\x80\x99s peaceful coexistence with its unnerved neighbors. Some of those neighbors, though, will probably continue fighting the long war: At a recent meeting on traffic safety at a church a few blocks from Asphalt Green, transfer station opponents heckled Mr. Schwartz, demanding that he abandon his compromise proposal and instead join their fight to sink the transfer station completely.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s an unreasonable demand. What\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable is Mr. Schwartz\xe2\x80\x99s compromise, which has the twin benefits of helping the neighborhood\xe2\x80\x99s children and ensuring the success of Mr. Bloomberg\xe2\x80\x99s and Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s well-considered plan for all the city\xe2\x80\x99s waste.'b'LAST Thursday, 'b'Sheldon Silver'b', the speaker of the New York Assembly for the past 20 years, was arrested and charged with mail and wire fraud, extortion and receiving bribes. According to Preet Bharara, the federal prosecutor who brought the charges, the once seemingly untouchable Mr. Silver took millions of dollars for legal work he did not do. In exchange, he used his official power to steer business to a law firm that specialized in getting tax breaks for real estate developers, and he directed state funds to a doctor who referred cases to another law firm that paid Mr. Silver fees.'b'Albany is reeling, but fighting the kind of corruption that plagues not only New York State but the whole nation isn\xe2\x80\x99t just about getting cuffs on the right guy. As with the recent conviction of the former Virginia governor Bob McDonnell for receiving improper gifts and loans, a fixation on plain graft misses the more pernicious poison that has entered our system.'b'Corruption exists when institutions and officials charged with serving the public serve their own ends. Under current law, campaign contributions are illegal if there is an explicit quid pro quo, and legal if there isn\xe2\x80\x99t. But legal campaign contributions can be as bad as bribes in creating obligations. The corruption that hides in plain sight is the real threat to our democracy.'b'Think of campaign contributions as the gateway drug to bribes. In our private financing system, candidates are trained to respond to campaign cash and serve donors\xe2\x80\x99 interests. Politicians are expected to spend half their time talking to funders and to keep them happy. Given this context, it\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to see how a bribery charge can feel like a technical argument instead of a moral one.'b'The former 'b'governor of New York David A. Paterson, for example, said that he had trouble understanding where the criminality lay in the allegation'b' that Mr. Silver accepted payments from law firms for referrals, including referrals by a doctor to whom Mr. Silver funneled state health research funds. Mr. Paterson said, \xe2\x80\x9cin the legal profession, people refer business all the time. And theoretically, as a speaker, you could do that as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The legal shades into the illegal. The real estate developers represented by the law firm that allegedly shuttled payments to Mr. Silver for fake legal services were also major campaign contributors. One developer mentioned in the charges gave more than $10 million to political campaigns in the past decade, including $200,000 to Mr. Silver and his political action committees.'b'The structure of private campaign finance has essentially pre-corrupted our politicians, so that they can\xe2\x80\x99t even recognize explicit bribery because it feels the same as what they do every day. When you spend a lifetime serving campaign donors, it may seem easy to serve them when they come with an outright bribe, because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem that different.'b'Mr. Silver retained such tight control over budgets and lawmaking in Albany that his staffers were regarded as more powerful than most elected representatives. As a Democrat who cares about education, I can\xe2\x80\x99t say that I loved seeing Mr. Silver, a great public school advocate, in handcuffs. For others, there\xe2\x80\x99s glee in seeing the perp walk. But one high-profile indictment does not represent the dawn of a new democracy.'b'We should take this moment to pursue fundamental reform. We must reconstitute what it means to run for office and to serve in office. We need to ban outside income for elected officials. Transparency alone is not enough; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t solve the problem of creating outside dependencies. New York lawmakers can\xe2\x80\x99t carry water for two masters when in office.'b'We should reject the private financing of campaigns as the only model. We need to provide enough public funding for campaigns so that anyone with a broad base of support can run for office, and respond effectively to attacks, without becoming dependent on private patrons. Running for office shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be a job defined by permanent begging at the feet of the wealthiest donors in the country.'b'Those two reforms would be transformational. We will never eradicate every shady deal, but we can make politics more about serving the public and less like legalized bribery.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s one last thing we should do: ban corporate spending and limit total campaign spending. Last week not only saw Mr. Silver in handcuffs, it also marked the fifth anniversary of the Citizens United ruling, in which the Supreme Court decided that outside corporate spending was in no way corrupting. We will have to revisit that decision, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t need to wait for the court to act.'b'Corruption is about greed and private interests put ahead of the public good. Whether influence is bought through a bribe, outside spending, outside income or campaign contributions, the public suffers in the same way. Until we move past scandals toward structural change, our democracy will suffer, too.'b'On one of the last occasions an Egyptian president visited Addis Ababa, he got no further than the road from the airport: In 1995 the motorcade of President Hosni Mubarak 'b'came under fire'b' from Egyptian jihadists. Mr. Mubarak was saved by 'b'his bulletproof car'b', his driver\xe2\x80\x99s skill and Ethiopian sharpshooters.'b'After that, Ethiopian and Egyptian intelligence officers worked together to root out terrorists in the Horn of Africa, contributing, along with pressure from the United States government, to Osama bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s expulsion from Sudan in 1996. But that was the limit of their cooperation.'b'Egypt and Ethiopia have otherwise been locked in a low-intensity contest over which nation would dominate the region, undermining each other\xe2\x80\x99s interests in Eritrea, Somalia and South Sudan. A quiet but long-sustained rivalry, it is one of those rarely noticed but important fault lines in international relations that allow other conflicts to rumble on.'b'This week, however, President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt is expected to fly to Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to attend 'b'a summit of the African Union'b'. He will also meet with Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn of Ethiopia, a rare chance to shift the political landscape in northeastern Africa.'b'The heart of the rivalry hinges on how to share the precious waters of the Nile River. Running low is Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare, and more than 80 percent of the Nile\xe2\x80\x99s water comes from rain that falls on the Ethiopian highlands and is then carried north by the fast-flowing Blue Nile. (Ethiopia is nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9cAfrica\xe2\x80\x99s water tower.\xe2\x80\x9d) Yet management of the Nile is formally governed by a 1929 treaty between Egypt and colonial Britain, and a 1959 treaty between Egypt and Sudan that awarded most water rights to Egypt, some to Sudan and none explicitly to Ethiopia or the other states upstream. This arrangement is widely considered unfair, especially to Ethiopia, which was never colonized, and on whose behalf Britain could not even claim to have spoken. This legal framework also limits the right of upper riparian states to build dams or irrigation systems even though they were sidelined from helping shape it.'b'Egypt has a history of blocking Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s requests for international aid to build dams, at times even threatening military action if it attempted to go ahead. Following the 1978 Camp David accords with Israel, President Anwar Sadat declared, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The only matter that could take Egypt to war again is the Nile water'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d To this day, Egyptian engineers are stationed as far as Lake Victoria, in Uganda, monitoring activities along the river.'b'Ethiopia has continued to reject Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s approach, not least because it is one of the poorest countries in the world and considers economic development to be essential to its survival. In 1999 Ethiopia, along with eight other states, set up the Nile Basin Initiative to develop a cooperative and equitable partnership to manage the river\xe2\x80\x99s resources. (Egypt and Sudan are nominal members but inactive; South Sudan joined in 2012.)'b'So far most concrete actions taken have been about combating erosion along the Nile\xe2\x80\x99s watersheds and encouraging sustainable management of lakes and subsidiary bodies of water.'b'Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, who was in power from 1991 until his death in 2012, also commissioned several huge dam projects. The largest of these is the 'b'Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam'b' on the Blue Nile, a point of national pride whose construction has been financed through the issuance of special bonds.'b'The plan has not gone down well with Egypt. During a meeting chaired by President Mohamed Morsi in June 2013 \xe2\x80\x94 captured on television cameras, apparently without the participants\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge \xe2\x80\x94 Egyptian politicians proposed sabotaging the dam project. (Last April unidentified gunmen attacked a bus near the site of the dam, killing nine people.) But Mr. Sisi knows that Ethiopia will not change course.'b'He also realizes that the dam\xe2\x80\x99s threat to Egypt is more symbolic than material. (His predecessors, including Mr. Morsi, knew that as well, but seemed more interested in entertaining anti-Ethiopian sentiment among Egyptians.) The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam is being built a few miles from Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s border with Sudan, in rocky terrain unsuitable for irrigation. The dam will generate electricity, meaning that Ethiopia, like Egypt, wants the water to flow through rather than be stopped. Moreover, the dam is set in a gorge at high altitude: It will store large amounts of water with less surface area in a cooler climate than, say, Lake Nasser in Egypt, reducing evaporation and saving water, which should also benefit Egypt.'b'Given these common interests, Egypt should cooperate with Ethiopia to manage the Nile\xe2\x80\x99s waters. Mr. Sisi made a strong start on this front last year, when the two countries set up a 'b'bilateral commission'b' to examine all aspects of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. It is now time for Egypt to join the Nile Basin Initiative\xe2\x80\x99s Cooperative Framework Agreement, which was signed in 2010 to \xe2\x80\x9cpromote integrated management, sustainable development, and harmonious utilization\xe2\x80\x9d of the Nile and to protect it \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit of present and future generations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Better relations with Ethiopia could also be Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s ticket to mending its difficult relations with other governments in sub-Saharan Africa. Two days after the Egyptian military ousted Mr. Morsi in July 2013, while Gulf states rushed to assist the new government, the African Union suspended Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s membership on grounds that the coup violated its principles. (Egypt has since been reinstated.) And there is little sympathy on the continent for Cairo\xe2\x80\x99s position on the Nile issue, since it appears to be blocking Ethiopia\xe2\x80\x99s development under colonial-era treaties widely seen as exploitative.'b'Mr. Sisi should take advantage of his coming visit to Addis Ababa to finally make progress on joint management of the Nile. That could open the way for Egypt and Ethiopia to find common ground on thornier issues, such as how to handle internal conflicts in Somalia and South Sudan. And that, in turn, could be a step toward greater stability in the region.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 Before a recent interview in Istanbul, I was talking to the journalist about Turkish politics. After about 15 minutes, she looked down and lowered her voice, as though confiding a secret: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is so tiring to be Turkish sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That mental exhaustion is caused for the most part by politics. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his leading cadres have chosen a divisive strategy, pursuing hostility over compromise and a politics of duality over a culture of coexistence. Even the most trivial or absurd questions can provoke heated debate: \xe2\x80\x9cWould laughing in public endanger a Turkish woman\xe2\x80\x99s modesty?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShould Turkish Airlines female flight attendants be allowed to wear red lipstick, and if not, which color might be permissible?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cShould patriotic citizens consume ayran (a yogurt drink) instead of raki?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAre all female drivers of red cars voting for the opposition party?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The unbearable fatigue is particularly sharp among liberal intellectuals and women. The liberals do not represent huge numbers of Turks, but they are an important measure against which the Justice and Development Party\xe2\x80\x99s political trajectory can be tracked. When the party first came to power in 2002, liberals supported it. A.K.P., the party\xe2\x80\x99s initials in Turkish, was pro-reform and pro-European Union. It was expected to promote civil liberties, a heartening idea after three military takeovers since 1960, each worse than the previous one. But as the party swerved toward authoritarianism, liberals were cast adrift.'b'At a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s dinner in Istanbul, I listened to my morose liberal friends: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two ways left for anyone who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sympathize with the A.K.P. today: Either we are going to become foolishly apolitical, or we\xe2\x80\x99ll get to be bitterly political. And if you want to be neither foolish nor bitter, tough luck!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some liberals have gone silent, but some stand in sharp opposition, while others engage in self-criticism. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the support for more pluralistic and democratic developments ... where we went wrong. It was failing to see that the A.K.P.\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries would turn out to be so narrow,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the Turkish author and sociologist Oya Baydar. \xe2\x80\x9cThose who used to say that the A.K.P. was only pretending to be democratic and would eventually replace military despotism with a civilian one ... have been proved right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today, liberals are viewed with scorn by the anti-A.K.P. camp for being too soft and na\xc3\xafve. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end, weren\xe2\x80\x99t they, as were some left-wing intellectuals in the 1950s and 1960s in the Soviet Union, the \xe2\x80\x98useful idiots\xe2\x80\x99 of the A.K.P. and Erdogan?\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Ariane Bonzon, a French journalist who covers Turkey and the Middle East.'b'Among Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s nonconservative women \xe2\x80\x94 at least half of the 48 percent who did not vote for Mr. Erdogan in the last election \xe2\x80\x94 there is a growing concern about the A.K.P.\xe2\x80\x99s meddling in their private lives. In the past, sexist statements from male politicians were regarded as spontaneous outbursts. Today, they are seen as part of a systematic and sinister ideological campaign to confine women to traditional gender roles. After the minister of health, Mehmet Muezzinoglu, visited the first baby born in 2015, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cMothers should not put any career other than motherhood at the center of their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The backlash was immediate. Turkish women have heard top government officials weigh in on subjects like abortion, cesarean-section deliveries, contraception and style of dress. \xe2\x80\x9cI am fed up with all these sexist comments, constantly telling us women how to live our lives,\xe2\x80\x9d Ayse Arman wrote in the newspaper Hurriyet. Protests were organized around the country. When I talked about the need for an independent women\xe2\x80\x99s movement and a new narrative of sisterhood to bridge political divides, some conservative head-scarved women said it would be hard to work with feminists since their interests had been ignored in the past.'b'This reaction speaks to one of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s greatest obstacles: how the past shapes the future. A sense of victimhood plagues society, and there is a constant cycle of retribution that creates new victims.'b'After the horrible shootings in Paris at the magazine Charlie Hebdo, and amid a rise in both Islamopobia and anti-Westernism, Turkey could have stood as a unifying voice, a modern, democratic, pluralistic Muslim country with a strong secularist tradition. But that is not the prevailing mood.'b'Mr. Erdogan blamed the West for the killings. \xe2\x80\x9cAs Muslims we have never taken part in terrorist massacres,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBehind these lie racism, hate speech and Islamophobia. Games are being played with the Islamic world \xe2\x80\x94 we need to be aware of this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those who criticize the government are accused of not being patriotic, or worse, as being pawns of Western powers trying to destroy Turkey. The latest victims include Miss Turkey of 2006, Merve Buyuksarac, who was questioned for insulting President Erdogan on her Instagram account; and Sedef Kabas, a journalist and anchorwoman, who was held by the police for tweeting about a cover-up of a government corruption scandal. One of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most popular actors, Tamer Karadagli, said, \xe2\x80\x9cArtists, businessmen ... we are all scared.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fatigue lingers. The gap between Turkey and the West widens. If as Turks we cannot find a way to embrace the ideals of free society, open debate, pluralistic culture and gender equality, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be just a failure of democracy, it will also be a failure of imagination and will.'b''b' 'b'Elif Shafak 'b' is a writer whose books include the novels \xe2\x80\x9cThe Architect\xe2\x80\x99s Apprentice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Forty Rules of Love.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The message from'b' Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s elections in Greece'b' was unambiguous: The Greeks cannot and will not continue to abide by the austerity regime that has brought their economy to its knees. It was a message the Germans and other Europeans who continue to insist that Greece pay off its mountainous debt, no matter what the damage, must hear. Persisting on their dogmatic course is not only wrong for Greece but dangerous for the entire European Union.'b'It is too soon to anticipate how Alexis Tsipras, the maverick politician whose left-wing Syriza party won 36.3 percent of the popular vote and nearly gained an outright majority in Parliament, intends to deliver on the promises he made to voters to abandon the austerity program while reducing the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt and retaining the euro.'b'These goals are fundamentally incompatible, but the new prime minister has signaled to Europeans that he is ready to moderate his ambitions once in office. It is essential that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who is seen by Greeks as the prime architect of the austerity program, and the \xe2\x80\x9ctroika\xe2\x80\x9d of the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund, which manage the Greek bailout, demonstrate a similar readiness to ease the size and conditions of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s debt burden.'b'Some of the creditors still seem to feel that a debt is a debt to be repaid in full, and that the Greeks \xe2\x80\x9cdeserve\xe2\x80\x9d punishment for their history of profligate spending and habitual tax evasion. But shrinking an economy by a quarter and throwing more than half the young people out of work \xe2\x80\x94 policies Mr. Tsipras has likened to waterboarding \xe2\x80\x94 is not the way to enable a country to pay back its debts. Greece needs some breathing room, not only to give Mr. Tsipras a chance to turn the country around but also for the sake of the rest of Europe.'b'Greece may be exceptional in the size of its debt burden, now about 177 percent of G.D.P., and its systemic problems run deep. But Greeks are not unique in their feelings of alienation and anger over the economic crisis that spread to many of the poorer countries of the European Union, and Syriza is hardly the most radical of the fringe parties that have arisen across Europe in reaction to the crisis. If Greece is pushed to the limit and compelled to default on its debt payments, and even to abandon the euro, the economic repercussions would spread through all Europe. Politically, a \xe2\x80\x9cGrexit\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Greek exit from the euro \xe2\x80\x94 would shatter the assumption that there is no retreat from the euro and further destabilize Europe. And it would certainly add fuel to anti-European Union sentiments that have propelled the growth of far-right parties.'b'Of course, Mr. Tsipras must use his popular mandate to push through the fundamental domestic reforms that his predecessor, Antonis Samaras, had begun. The moneyed elites\xe2\x80\x99 aversion to paying taxes must be brought to an end, along with the corruption, nepotism and cronyism in government. Opposing austerity does not mean abandoning reform as a 'b'group of prominent economists wrote'b' recently in The Financial Times.'b'There is not a lot of time, though. Greece\xe2\x80\x99s current bailout program expires on Feb. 28. European Union leaders \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Tsipras among them \xe2\x80\x94 are scheduled to gather in Brussels on Feb. 12. An announcement there of an extension of the program for several months would be a good signal that the Europeans have heard the cry of the Greeks and are prepared to be more sensible.'b'When the United States at last abandons the abhorrent practice of capital punishment, the early years of the 21st century will stand out as a peculiar period during which otherwise reasonable people hotly debated how to kill other people while inflicting the least amount of constitutionally acceptable pain.'b'The Supreme Court stepped back into this maelstrom on Friday, when it 'b'agreed to hear'b' Warner v. Gross, a lawsuit brought by four Oklahoma death-row inmates alleging that the state\xe2\x80\x99s lethal-injection drug protocol puts them at risk of significant pain and suffering.'b'In accepting the case, the justices had to change its name. The lead plaintiff, Charles Warner, 'b'was executed'b' on Jan. 15 after the court, by a vote of 5-to-4, 'b'denied'b' him a last-minute stay. That may sound strange until you consider that while it takes only four justices to accept a case for argument, 'b'it takes five'b' to stay an execution. The case is now named for another inmate, Richard Glossip. (On Monday, the Oklahoma attorney general requested temporary stays of the impending executions of Mr. Glossip and the other two plaintiffs.)'b'Mr. Warner was sentenced to death for raping and murdering an 11-month-old girl named Adrianna Waller in 1997. His execution was originally scheduled for last April, but it was postponed when officials 'b'botched the execution'b' directly before his \xe2\x80\x94 leaving the inmate, Clayton Lockett, writhing and moaning on the killing table for more than half an hour. The plaintiffs in the current case challenge the continued use of one of the drugs that may have contributed to Mr. Lockett\xe2\x80\x99s prolonged death, the sedative midazolam.'b'The justices have been here before. They 'b'upheld'b' the constitutionality of lethal injection in 2008. But, since then, the battles over the practice have grown more warped. Many drug makers now refuse to supply their products for killing, leaving states to experiment on their inmates with other drugs, often acquired under cover of official secrecy and administered by authorities with no medical training. During a 'b'hearing'b' last month on Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s protocol, a state witness who testified that midazolam is effective appeared to rely on the website 'b'drugs.com'b', not scientific studies. It would all be a laughable farce if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t involve killing people.'b'There is disingenuousness on both sides. Many who oppose the death penalty, this page included, are obviously not interested in identifying more \xe2\x80\x9chumane\xe2\x80\x9d methods of execution; the idea itself is a contradiction in terms. Nor are many capital punishment supporters concerned with how much suffering a condemned person might endure in his final moments. In the middle sit the armchair executioners who engage in macabre debates about the relative efficiency of, say, nitrogen gas.'b'It is time to dispense with the pretense of a pain-free death. The act of killing itself is irredeemably brutal and violent. If the men on death row had painlessly killed their victims, that would not make their crimes any more tolerable. When the killing is carried out by a state against its own citizens, it is beneath a people that aspire to call themselves civilized.'b'Last summer, Alex Kozinski, a federal appellate judge in California and a supporter of the death penalty, called out this charade for what it is.'b'Lethal injections, 'b'he wrote'b', are \xe2\x80\x9ca misguided effort to mask the brutality of executions by making them look serene and peaceful.\xe2\x80\x9d But executions \xe2\x80\x9care brutal, savage events, and nothing the state tries to do can mask that reality. Nor should it. If we as a society want to carry out executions, we should be willing to face the fact that the state is committing a horrendous brutality on our behalf.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A NEW Ukraine was born a year ago in the pro-European protests that helped to 'b'drive President Viktor F. Yanukovych from power'b'. And today, the spirit that inspired 'b'hundreds of thousands'b' to gather in the Maidan, Kiev\xe2\x80\x99s Independence Square, is stronger than ever, even as it is under direct military assault from Russian forces supporting separatists in eastern Ukraine.'b'The new Ukraine seeks to become the opposite of the old Ukraine, which was demoralized and riddled with corruption. The transformation has been a rare experiment in participatory democracy; a noble adventure of a people who have rallied to open their nation to modernity, democracy and Europe. And this is just the beginning.'b'This experiment is remarkable for finding expression not only in defending Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s territorial integrity from the separatists, but also in constructive work. Maidan\xe2\x80\x99s supporters have moved from opposition to nation building.'b'Many of those in government and Parliament are volunteers who have given up well-paying jobs to serve their country. Natalie Jaresko, a former investment banker, now works for a few hundred dollars a month as the new finance minister. Volunteers are helping Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s one million internally displaced people as well as working as advisers to ministers and in local government.'b'The new Ukraine, however, faces a potent challenge from the old Ukraine. The old Ukraine is solidly entrenched in a state bureaucracy that has worked hand in hand with a business oligarchy. And the reformers are also up against the manifest hostility of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s president, Vladimir V. Putin, who wants at all costs to destabilize Ukraine.'b'One drawback is that the new Ukraine is a well-kept secret, not just from the rest of the world but also from the Ukrainian public. Radical reforms have been hatched but not yet implemented.'b'It is instructive to compare Ukraine today with Georgia in 2004. When he became president that year, Mikheil Saakashvili immediately replaced the hated traffic police and removed the roadblocks used to extort bribes from drivers. The public recognized straight away that things had changed for the better.'b'Unfortunately, Ukraine has not yet found a similar demonstration project. Kiev\xe2\x80\x99s police force is to be restructured, but if you need a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, you must still pay the same bribe as before.'b'Mr. Saakashvili was a revolutionary leader who first stamped out corruption but eventually turned it into a state monopoly. By contrast, Ukraine is a participatory democracy that does not rely on a single leader but on checks and balances. Democracies move slowly, but that may prove an advantage in the long run.'b'The big question is, will there be a long run? Although Russia is in a deepening financial crisis, Mr. Putin appears to have decided that he can destroy the new Ukraine before it can fully establish itself and before an economic downturn destroys his own popularity.'b'The Russian president is stepping up the military and financial pressure on Ukraine. 'b'Over the weekend, the city of Mariupol came under attack'b' from forces that 'b'NATO said were backed by Russian troops'b', 'b'undermining the pretense that the separatists are acting on their own'b'.'b'Ukraine will defend itself militarily, but it urgently needs financial assistance. The immediate need is for $15 billion. But to ensure Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s survival and encourage private investment, Western powers need to make a political commitment to provide additional sums, depending on the extent of the Russian assault and the success of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s reforms.'b'The reformers, who want to avoid the leakages that were characteristic of the old Ukraine, have expressed their wish to be held accountable for all expenditures. They are passing extensive legislation but also want the International Monetary Fund to go on exercising oversight.'b'Unfortunately, just as democracies are slow to move, an association of democracies like the European Union is even slower. Mr. Putin is exploiting this.'b'It is not only the future of Ukraine that\xe2\x80\x99s at stake, but that of the European Union itself. The loss of Ukraine would be an enormous blow; it would empower a Russian alternative to the European Union based on the rule of force rather than the rule of law. But if Europe delivered the financial assistance that Ukraine needs, Mr. Putin would eventually be forced to abandon his aggression. At the moment, he can argue that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s economic troubles are caused by Western hostility, and the Russian public finds his argument convincing.'b'If, however, Europe is generous with its financial assistance, a stable and prosperous Ukraine will provide an example that makes clear that the blame for Russia\xe2\x80\x99s financial troubles lies with Mr. Putin. The Russian public might then force him to emulate the new Ukraine. Europe\xe2\x80\x99s reward would be a new Russia that has turned from a potent strategic threat into a potential strategic partner. Those are the stakes.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Library Visit, Then Held at Gunpoint'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 26), by Charles M.

It was much in the news last week, after its authors, five scientists from Portland State University, 'b'published a peer-reviewed letter'b' outlining their findings in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBefore You Vape: High Levels of Formaldehyde Hidden in E-Cigs,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'the headline at NBC.com'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cCan You Guess What Cancer-Causing Agent Researchers Just Found in Electronic Cigarettes?\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'asked The Motley Fool'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cE-Cigarettes Not Safer Than Ordinary Cigarettes,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'claimed the online publication Tech Times'b'. The New England Journal of Medicine 'b'chimed in with a tweet of its own'b': \xe2\x80\x9cChemical analysis of e-cigs\xe2\x80\x99 vapor show high levels of formaldehyde,\xe2\x80\x9d it read. \xe2\x80\x9cAuthors project higher cancer risk than smoking.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The study focused on a device known as a premium vaporizer that heats a flavored liquid containing nicotine. The heat causes the liquid to turn into vapor, which the user inhales. Most of these devices also allow the user to control the voltage. 'b'These devices have become increasingly popular'b' as a way to ingest nicotine without smoking.'b'In the study, the Portland State scientists ran the device at both a low voltage and a high voltage. At the low voltage, they did not detect formaldehyde. But at the high voltage, they found some. Formaldehyde is, indeed, a known carcinogen, which also exists, among hundreds of other toxic chemicals and dozens of cancer-causing agents, in combustible cigarettes. The authors concluded that someone who was a heavy user of a vaporizer at the high voltage was five to 15 times more likely to get cancer than a longtime smoker. Or so they seemed to say.'b'There is not much doubt that studies like this have an impact on the public perception of e-cigarettes. Even though cigarettes result in 480,000 American deaths each year \xe2\x80\x94 and even though it is the tobacco, not the nicotine, that kills them \xe2\x80\x94 many in the public health community treat e-cigarettes as every bit as evil. Every dollop of news suggesting that vaping is bad for your health, much of which has been overblown, is irrationally embraced\xc2\xa0 by anti-tobacco activists. One result is that, whereas 84 percent of current smokers thought e-cigarettes were safer than ordinary cigarettes in 2010, that 'b'number had dropped to 65 percent by 2013'b'.'b'Worse, close to a third of the people who had abandoned e-cigarettes and returned to smoking did so because they were worried about the health effects of vaping, according to a study published last year in the journal Nicotine &amp; Tobacco Research.'b'The Portland State study fits right into this dynamic. It is, on the one hand, factually true that vaping at an extremely high voltage will cause formaldehyde-releasing agents to develop.'b'But this conclusion is highly misleading. People don\xe2\x80\x99t vape at a high voltage because it causes a horrible taste \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ca burning taste that occurs from overheating the liquid,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Konstantinos Farsalinos, a Greek scientist and vaping expert, in an email to me. Farsalinos has done human studies of vaping and discovered that above a certain voltage \xe2\x80\x94 lower than the high voltage test on the Portland State study \xe2\x80\x94 people simply couldn\xe2\x80\x99t inhale; the taste was unbearable.'b'Indeed, the study actually conveys good news. When used at normal voltage, vaping does not produce formaldehyde! \xe2\x80\x9cRather than scaring people about the dangers of vaping and alarming them to the \xe2\x80\x98fact\xe2\x80\x99 that vaping raises their cancer risk above that of smoking, we should instead be regulating the voltage and temperature conditions of electronic cigarettes so that the problem of formaldehyde contamination is completely avoided,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Michael Siegel, a professor of public health at Boston University, 'b'on his blog'b'. But given the way the Portland State authors characterized their research, it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that headline writers took away a different message.'b'When I spoke to David Peyton, one of the study\xe2\x80\x99s authors, he insisted that the study had been mischaracterized. All it was meant to do, he said, was compare the levels of formaldehyde in e-cigarettes versus cigarettes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is exceedingly frustrating to me that we are being associated with saying that e-cigarettes are more dangerous than cigarettes,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a fact not in evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d Well, maybe.'b'When I read him the tweet from the New England Journal of Medicine \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cAuthors project higher cancer risk than smoking\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he sounded horrified. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the tweet,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI regret that. That is not my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lot we don\xe2\x80\x99t yet know about e-cigarettes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Peyton toward the end of our conversation. He is right about that; e-cigarettes are still so new that they need to be studied carefully. And he and his co-authors are planning further studies. Perhaps the next time, they will produce something that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t serve mainly as a scare tactic to keep smokers away from e-cigarettes.'b'The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge covers only a small part of Alaska. Smaller still is the coastal plain of the refuge, a narrow, 1.5 million-acre strip flanking the Beaufort Sea. The plain is an ecological and biological wonder, the hunting grounds for Alaskan natives and home to caribou, polar bears, all manner of marine life and countless bird species. It may also contain one of the biggest unexploited oil fields in America.'b'For all these reasons, the plain has been the subject of a bitter tug of war between politicians and oil companies that covet its commercial resources, on one side, and conservationists who think that opening it would be a calamity \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe equivalent,\xe2\x80\x9d the former secretary of the interior Bruce Babbitt 'b'once said'b', \xe2\x80\x9cof offering Yellowstone National Park for geothermal drilling, or calling for bids to construct hydropower dams in the Grand Canyon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Obama has now come down emphatically on the side of conservation. At the recommendation of Sally Jewell, his secretary of the interior, and John Podesta, his senior counselor, Mr. Obama 'b'proposed on Sunday'b' to set aside more than 12 million acres of the refuge as permanent wilderness, including the 1.5 million acres of the coastal plain. Wilderness designation is the highest level of protection the government can confer on public land. It would bar commercial development of any kind, including, crucially, oil-and-gas exploration.'b'The proposal is the latest instance of the president\xe2\x80\x99s use of his executive authority, which he has deployed in an effort to circumvent a hostile Congress on issues like immigration and climate change. While Congress must put the final stamp of approval on any wilderness proposal, under law the areas so designated by a president will receive full wilderness protections until Congress acts. Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s action also stirred echoes of former President Bill Clinton, who used his last two years in office to protect millions of acres of land from commercial exploitation.'b'From the perspective of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s energy needs, Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s timing was just right. Estimates of the oil under the coastal plain have varied wildly over the years, but while extracting the oil never seemed worth the devastation it would cause, it seems less so now that major new oil deposits have been discovered in the lower 48 states and consumption is dwindling along with America\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on imports.'b'Other measures to protect the Arctic are likely to emerge in the days ahead. A new five-year leasing plan in the works at the Interior Department reportedly includes restrictions on new oil leases in the Arctic Ocean, where existing leases owned by Shell and other companies are already controversial. The Obama administration is also considering whether to further limit oil-and-gas production in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, half of which was placed off limits to drilling by Ken Salazar, a former interior secretary, shortly before he left office in 2013.'b'None of this, obviously, pleases Senator Lisa Murkowski and many other Alaskans, who have been complaining of federal land grabs for decades. \xe2\x80\x9cA stunning attack on our sovereignty,\xe2\x80\x9d is the way Ms. Murkowski put it, echoing her father, a former Alaska senator and governor, Frank Murkowski, who worked tirelessly to open up the refuge for drilling. That his daughter has been no more successful is cause for cheer.'b'The big debate during the 20th century was about the relationship between the market and the state. Both those institutions are now tarnished. The market is prone to devastating crashes and seems to be producing widening inequality. Government is gridlocked, sclerotic or captured by special interests. Government is an ever more rigid and ineffective tool to address market failures.'b'So over the past generation many of the most talented people on earth have tried to transform capitalism itself, to use the market to solve social problems. These are people with opposable minds: part profit-oriented and part purpose-oriented. They\xe2\x80\x99ve created organizations that look a little like a business, a little like a social-service provider, and a little like a charity \xe2\x80\x94 or some mixture of the three.'b'Hippie companies like Ben &amp; Jerry\xe2\x80\x99s ice cream led the first wave in this sector, but now you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a burgeoning array of social-capitalist tools to address problems \xe2\x80\x94 ranging from B Corporations like Warby Parker (which gives free glasses to the poor) to social impact bonds. (For example, a private investor raises money to finance a program to reduce recidivism. If the program works and the government saves money because there are fewer prisoners to house, then the government pays back the investor, with a profit.)'b'Impact investing is probably the most promising of these tools. Impact investing is not socially responsible investing. Socially responsible investing means avoiding certain companies, like tobacco growers. Impact investors seek out companies that are intentionally designed both to make a profit and provide a measurable and accountable social good. Impact funds are frequently willing to accept lower financial returns for the sake of doing good \xe2\x80\x94 say a 7 percent annual return compared with an 11 percent return. But some impact investors are seeking to deliver market-rate returns.'b'Brian Trelstad of Bridges Ventures, has looked at companies in early autism intervention, paid for by Medicaid, that can improve long-term educational outcomes while reducing spending on special education; affordable after-school enrichment programs that bring extra education services to charter school students; and energy efficiency companies that serve people in public housing, which saves long term heating costs.'b'When impact funds came on the scene, seven or so years ago, there was the usual overhyping. A 2010 report by the Rockefeller Foundation and JPMorgan projected that impact investing could see new capital inflows of up to $1 trillion by 2020. That\xe2\x80\x99s looking unlikely given that right now roughly something like only $40 billion has been invested through these funds.'b'There are more roadblocks than anticipated. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find a reliable way to measure the social impact of these dual-purpose companies. Impact investors have also had trouble finding scalable deals to invest in. It costs as much to do due diligence on a $250 million deal as on a $25 million deal, so many firms would rather skip the small stuff.'b'The hype created skepticism and a backlash. But impact investing is now entering the mainstream. An older generation used their (rigorous) business mind in one setting and then their (often sloppy) charity mind in another. Today more people want to blend these minds. Typically a big client, or a young heir, will go to his or her investments adviser and say, \xe2\x80\x9cI want some socially useful investments in my portfolio.\xe2\x80\x9d If the adviser has nothing on offer, the client leaves the firm.'b'New impact funds are being born. In a low-interest-rate era, they can offer comparable returns. The Obama administration has been aggressively supportive. Social stock exchanges are being founded. The big players like Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse are now in the field.'b'I recently sat in a beautiful New York meeting room with a nicely and formally dressed banker, Andy Sieg, as he discussed the impact fund he\xe2\x80\x99s helping to create at Merrill Lynch. He said his associates, especially his young associates, were extremely eager to work on the project. People are eager to have this kind of impact.'b'Impact investing is not going to replace government or be a panacea, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one of a number of new tools to address social problems. If you want to leave a mark on the world but are unsure of how to do it, I\xe2\x80\x99d say take a look. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a high-net-worth individual (a rich person), ask your adviser to get you involved. If you\xe2\x80\x99re young and searching, get some finance and operational skills and then find a way to get involved in a socially useful investment proposition. If you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a business mind, there are huge opportunities to build the infrastructure (creating measuring systems, connecting investors with deals).'b'Someday government will get unstuck, with new programs to address this new era. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no prospect of that happening soon. Right now social capitalism is a more creative and dynamic place to spend a life.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Redefining Mental Illness'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by T. M.

This was after his name had appeared in a local newspaper on a list of known atheists. Instead of protecting him, the police accused him of insulting Islam.'b'Such tag teams of family, media and state are not uncommon in cases against atheists. Because atheism itself is not illegal in Egypt, charges are laid under laws against blasphemy or contempt for religion. In 2012, a 27-year-old blogger, Alber Saber, received a three-year sentence on charges of blasphemy for creating a web page called \xe2\x80\x9cEgyptian Atheists.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2013, the writer and human rights activist Karam Saber (no relation) was convicted of defaming religion in his short story collection \xe2\x80\x9cWhere Is God?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Similar charges have been used for political purposes against Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Christian minority.

The further from that identity you are, the more vulnerable you are.'b'If anything, Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s nominally secular ruler is more Catholic than the pope, to borrow a metaphor from another religion. Assuming the role of defender of public morality is a deliberate reminder that the Islamists do not hold the copyright on piety. This is not new: The regime of the ousted President Hosni Mubarak often vaunted its religiosity to outdo its Islamists rivals.'b'Nowhere is this morality power play exercised more vehemently than in curbing perceived religious and sex crimes. Hence Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s witch hunt against gay men. Rights activists say that 2014 was the worst year in a decade for gay people in Egypt, with at least 150 men arrested or put on trial. Same-sex relationships are not illegal, but gay men are targeted under \xe2\x80\x9cdebauchery\xe2\x80\x9d laws.'b'Last month, 26 men were arrested in a televised police raid on a public bathhouse in Cairo. The men should never have been arrested, but the surprise was that they were all acquitted on Jan. 12. Understandably upset at their loved ones\xe2\x80\x99 ordeal, the families of the acquitted men chanted \xe2\x80\x9cHere are the real men!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 ever-keen to reassert their relatives\xe2\x80\x99 identity as heterosexual, conservative Muslims.'b'After the outcry that followed the men\xe2\x80\x99s humiliation, the court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling perhaps reflects a tacit acknowledgment of prosecutorial overreach. But why all this hullabaloo over already marginal groups like atheists and gay people?'b'Dar al-Ifta, the institute for the study of Islamic law that is responsible for issuing religious edicts, was deservedly derided after it published a report in October saying that Egypt had the highest number of atheists in the Middle East: exactly 866\xe2\x80\x94 hardly a plausible number in a nation of 87 million. Yet the pro-government media and religious officials are waging a \xe2\x80\x9cwar on atheism.\xe2\x80\x9d Atheists are described alternately as threats to national security or as carriers of a dangerously contagious virus.'b'In this atmosphere, it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to gauge people\xe2\x80\x99s candid views on religion. For those who don\xe2\x80\x99t genuflect to the official order, a \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d policy in Egypt long provided cover. But to admit atheism is to invite not just arrest but a threat to one\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'In a speech this month honoring the Prophet Muhammad\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, Mr. Sisi called on Muslim leaders in Egypt to start a \xe2\x80\x9creligious revolution\xe2\x80\x9d to counter the jihadist message of the Islamic State. He also sent his foreign minister to the solidarity march after the attacks in Paris at the office of the magazine Charlie Hebdo and a kosher supermarket.'b'The contradiction in Mr. Sisi\xe2\x80\x99s aim of keeping the heterosexual, conservative Muslim man at the top of Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s moral hierarchy is glaring. You can\xe2\x80\x99t trump the Islamists in their piety and lead a campaign against minorities like atheists and gay men even as you condemn extremist violence and show solidarity for free speech and free thinking.'b'This week we mark the fourth anniversary of the 2011 revolution. Although it has not delivered the political freedoms it called for, it did begin an unraveling of authority that has left Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s self-appointed moral guardians disconcerted and scrambling. Armed with social media, more people are insisting on asking and telling \xe2\x80\x94 about personal belief and sexual identity. A reckoning is long overdue in a country where religion and morality have so often been bent to suit the political expedients of its rulers.'b'Despite the clampdown, atheists are openly challenging such hypocrisy. Social media has allowed those who \xe2\x80\x9cdeviate\xe2\x80\x9d from the authoritarian template to find one another and express themselves in ways that the regime, its men of religion and its media otherwise deny them. A religious revolution has begun, but not on Mr. Sisi\xe2\x80\x99s or the clerics\xe2\x80\x99 terms. We all stand to gain if fathers no longer testify against sons, and families no longer feel the need to prove their loved ones are \xe2\x80\x9creal men.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\n'b'Mona Eltahawy 'b' is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cHeadscarves and Hymens: Why the Middle East Needs a Sexual Revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'NAPLES, Italy \xe2\x80\x94  \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah,\xe2\x80\x9d which recounts the exploits of the fictional Savastanos crime family, is Italy\xe2\x80\x99s all-time most popular TV series. And it is starting to go global: Twelve of the first episodes have already been sold for broadcast in 50 countries. \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d will tell world viewers a great story. But what will it tell them about Italy itself?'b'The Savastanos are part of the Camorra, Naples\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Mafia. The boss, Pietro, is married to Imma; their son is Gennaro, better known as Genny. Ciro is their go-to hit man, and Salvatore Conte is their rival. These meticulous, over-the-top killers manage to square a love of music with violence, drug dealing, exotic interior d\xc3\xa9cor,  devotion to the saints and a passion  for firearms.'b'The setting is the outskirts of Naples, a tangle of overpasses, badly lit parking lots and outsize concrete housing projects, including the infamous Le Vele. Occasionally, as contrast, a picture-postcard Mediterranean appears in the background, the view tourists see on their way to the Amalfi Coast.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah,\xe2\x80\x9d based on the best-selling book of the same name by the journalist Roberto Saviano, takes its title from the sinful city in the Bible; handily, it also rhymes with Camorra. The Italy that \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d portrays is squalid, brutal and comes as a surprise to some. \xe2\x80\x9cFor those of us who romanticize Italy, \xe2\x80\x98Gomorrah\xe2\x80\x99 is a fizzing antidote,\xe2\x80\x9d according to London\xe2\x80\x99s Daily Telegraph.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not the first time that Italian-style criminality has inspired spectacular artistic results. From \xe2\x80\x9cThe Godfather\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Hustle,\xe2\x80\x9d filmmakers have long worked with Mafia-centered plots. Television came along later, but has shown equal enthusiasm. Six seasons and 86 episodes, running from 1999 to 2007, made \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sopranos\xe2\x80\x9d an enviable success. That chronicle of an Italian-American family exemplified the mix of dishonesty and sympathy, love and cruelty, that allegedly runs through Italian organized crime, and it quickly won over millions of international viewers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d is more realistic. The criminals aren\xe2\x80\x99t glorified; there are no lovable monsters like Tony Soprano.  Its story lines are fictional, but they draw on current events. With stunning camerawork, fast-paced tempos and well-written dialogue that rolls out in accurately rendered Neapolitan Italian, it is proof, if proof were needed, that Italians can turn out first-rate television. Before shooting \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah,\xe2\x80\x9d the director Stefano Sollima had made the popular Rome-based  TV series \xe2\x80\x9cRomanzo Criminale\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cCriminal Novel\xe2\x80\x9d). Before that, Mr. Sollima worked as a cameraman for global news networks like CNN, NBC and CBS, sometimes in  war zones.'b'In short, Italy has created a popular, realistic, beautifully rendered TV series \xe2\x80\x94 which is what has so many people worried. The international success of \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d could turn into bad publicity for Naples and Italy, just as the young government of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is trying so hard to restore confidence among foreigners. Italy has worked hard to move beyond the national stereotype of the unprincipled, untrustworthy wheeler-dealer toting a pistol in one hand and a plate of spaghetti (or, in \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah,\xe2\x80\x9d a fried fish) in the other. The very realism that critics and viewers love could easily backfire, reinforcing the idea that something is rotten in the state of Italy.'b'Similar charges were leveled at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sopranos,\xe2\x80\x9d which is set in New Jersey. The Italian-American community took umbrage, claiming the series fostered the worst clich\xc3\xa9s to the point of being defamatory. The National Italian American Foundation and Mario Cuomo, the former governor of New York, protested. The cast members were kept away from Columbus Day parades. In 2001, a PublicMind poll reported that viewers who watched \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sopranos\xe2\x80\x9d tended to regard Italian-Americans and New Jersey negatively.'b'Will \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d do the same for the city and people of Naples?'b'Many of my compatriots are wringing their hands over this question. But I think their concerns are, fortunately, misplaced, precisely because of the show\xe2\x80\x99s realism. The Savastanos are not going to be the new Sopranos. Characters in \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d compel \xe2\x80\x94 as they do in any good TV series \xe2\x80\x94 but they don\xe2\x80\x99t charm. Empathy is absent. \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d hasn\xe2\x80\x99t got goodies and baddies; just baddies and worsies. Viewers observe and learn, but don\xe2\x80\x99t identify with them.'b'And what they learn is that Italy, like every other society on Earth, has a dark side. But \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d also makes clear that this is just a \xe2\x80\x9cside,\xe2\x80\x9d that it is not all of Italy. The Naples in which the criminals operate is also shown to have the second-largest passenger port in the world, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s fourth-largest urban economy and Europe\xe2\x80\x99s largest historic center, a Unesco World Heritage site. The realism in \xe2\x80\x9cGomorrah\xe2\x80\x9d is never lurid or sensational; it is measured, so that viewers sense that there is a world beyond it, an Italy that is not about corruption and murder.'b'In this way, it is more like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wire,\xe2\x80\x9d David Simon\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece about drugs, cops and poverty in Baltimore. As tightly focused as that series is, there is always a sense that there is more to the city, and to American society, than cocaine, graft and guns.'b'So my fellow Italians should just relax, and enjoy some great TV.

A few conservatives toyed with repealing the section of the 1975 Racial Discrimination Act that outlaws racially offensive and insulting language, but the government killed that plan last year because it was so unpopular.'b'Prime Minister Tony Abbott recently said that the terrorists \xe2\x80\x9chate our freedom\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 hardly the words of a man who thinks we need to improve freedom of speech.

Untrue. In matters meteorological as in others, Manhattan is solipsism central.'b'Still, there are questions to be fairly asked. Was it really necessary, at 11 p.m. Monday, to take the extraordinary step of shutting down the subways? Especially when it turned out that some trains were still running, empty, as a way of maintaining the system?'b'That was Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s call, and it could have waited, if indeed it ever had to be made. Friends who\xe2\x80\x99ve lived through Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s brutal winters tell me that its mass transit never lets up. And while Russia\xe2\x80\x99s people are hardier, their vehicles are not.'b'To varying degrees, Cuomo, de Blasio, Christie and other politicians overreacted, at least slightly, but who\xe2\x80\x99s to blame?

The correspondents get to wear their ski-chalet best and to roar over the wind\xe2\x80\x99s whisper.'b'In a more nuanced environment, the politicians in the snow\xe2\x80\x99s path could have charted a better midcourse between readiness and run-for-cover alarm.

Mr. Obama had barely gotten off his plane in New Delhi when he and Mr. Modi 'b'embraced'b' like old friends. They share humble roots. A visit by Mr. Modi to the White House in September went exceptionally well. And there was plenty of colorful symbolism in New Delhi: Mr. Obama became the first American president to attend the annual 'b'Republic Day parade'b'.'b'There are strategic imperatives at work as well. Both leaders need to expand their economies, and both see the other as a crucial partner in offsetting China\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly assertive role in Asia. The potential for cooperation is considerable. Much of the public focus on the visit was on trade, energy and breaking a logjam that has held up the sale of American nuclear energy technology to India. But when Mr. Modi and Mr. Obama sat down to talk, the first 45 minutes of the discussion was consumed by China.'b'Although it has a history of suspicion and rivalry with China, India has acted independently in foreign policy and resisted American efforts to forge a common front. That seems to be changing with Mr. Modi, who shares concerns about China\xe2\x80\x99s growing economic and military strength and has shown remarkable confidence in striking a new path. He'b' signed a joint statement'b' with Mr. Obama chiding the Chinese government for provoking conflict with its neighbors over the South China Sea; suggested reviving a security network involving the United States, India, Japan and Australia; and expressed interest in playing a greater role in the\xc2\xa0'b'Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation'b'\xc2\xa0forum, in which India could help balance China\xe2\x80\x99s influence.'b'China was not happy, dismissing the visit as a \xe2\x80\x9csuperficial rapprochement.\xe2\x80\x9d The trick for Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi will be to stand firm in support of a stable, rules-based order in Asia while not provoking China.'b'That could be tested by their decision to renew a 10-year defense pact as well as agreements to proceed jointly on developing military hardware, including 'b'Raven drones'b', systems for Lockheed\xe2\x80\x99s C-130 transport planes and jet engine technology. India is the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest weapons importer and, just last year, the United States overtook Russia as India\xe2\x80\x99s main arms supplier. Mr. Modi, who has made economic growth his first priority, is determined to develop an indigenous defense industry. The question is how to do that without fueling a regional arms race.'b'No real breakthroughs were announced on trade. The Americans have been frustrated with the slow pace of Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s economic reforms; and the solution that the two leaders claimed to have found to the Indian liability law that has blocked the sales of American nuclear fuel and reactors struck observers as vague and inconclusive. The impasse has long marred a 'b'2006 nuclear deal'b' that was supposed to help energy-hungry India.'b'The modest movement on\xc2\xa0climate change was disappointing. India agreed to move to phase down hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, in line with a treaty called the Montreal Protocol. But it set no specific goals limiting greenhouse gases, as China did in its meeting with Mr. Obama in November. India is the third-largest carbon polluter behind the United States and China but has resisted bolder measures, citing its need to lift hundreds of millions out of poverty. Without India on board with commitments, the best efforts of the rest of the world will not be enough.'b'Mr. Obama could not leave India without addressing human rights. In 'b'a speech on Tuesday'b', he urged India to protect the rights of girls and women, combat human trafficking and slavery, promote religious and racial tolerance, and empower young people. Hopes have faded that Mr. Modi would rein in the divisive agenda of his militant Hindu-nationalist supporters. But his plans to build India into an economic powerhouse will mean nothing if the country devolves into division and bloodshed.'b'With their talk of an \xe2\x80\x9cenduring commitment,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama and Mr. Modi have raised expectations and set a firm basis for moving forward. Even so, the countries have no obvious plans to deal with Pakistan or the India-Pakistan nuclear competition that threatens the region, and it cannot be assumed that all past differences will fade. Building a true partnership will take sustained efforts over many decades.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Secrets of Street Names'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Spencer Rascoff and Stan Humphries (Sunday Review, Jan. 25):'b'I have lived in Chicago, New York and Washington for most of my life, but I did not find the perfect street name until I retired to Fernandina Beach, Fla.'b'There are copious street names celebrating Amelia Island (on which the town is situated) and its proximity to the Atlantic beaches. But my favorite name is this: Why Road.'b'Odd, until you look down this largely unpaved alley to nowhere. Then it becomes clear. How many street names make you smile?'b'PHILIP McBRIDE JOHNSON'b'\nFernandina Beach, Fla., Jan. 25, 2015'b''b'Strike another blow against so-called convenience and bring back the paper coffee cup with the Greek columns: foam cups and other polystyrene foam packaging, even packing \xe2\x80\x9cpeanuts,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'are going bye-bye in New York'b' City.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re already banned, or will be, 'b'in over 100 jurisdictions in the United States'b', including the District of Columbia; Seattle; Portland, Ore.; Minneapolis and San Francisco, and some 90 other municipalities in California. But the New York City move may signal the death knell for the stuff most of us call by its common (and technically misapplied) name, Styrofoam.'b'In a way, the end seems to have been long-delayed; remember, in one of its most progressive moves ever, McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s stopped using the stuff for its chicken and hamburger containers nearly 25 years ago (though they kept foam cups till 2013).'b'This is a small but symbolic victory, part of an encouraging trend that indicates there are considerations beyond ease and profits.'b'But environmentally, it won\xe2\x80\x99t make much of a difference. Nonprofits and small businesses can become exempt \xe2\x80\x94 ludicrous exceptions, since even a spokesperson for the New York State Restaurant Association 'b'called the cost of replacement packaging \xe2\x80\x9cnominal\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and foam peanuts can still be used in packing originating elsewhere. The 28,000 tons of the stuff New York City collects annually will decline significantly, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t disappear. And while that sounds like a lot'b', it\xe2\x80\x99s less than 1 percent'b' of what the city picks up curbside. Nor does the ban address rigid polystyrene like that used in CD cases, which accounts for another 30,000 tons of junk.'b'So if the ban were totally successful, it would reduce the amount of polystyrene in landfills by less than 50 percent, and the amount of overall curbside collection by less than half of a percent. Not exactly a revolution in waste reduction. (There are other reasons to ban polystyrene, which is a suspected carcinogen.)'b'But to see the ban in context generates hope. In addition to forcing both industry and consumers to seek alternatives, the ban\xe2\x80\x99s importance lies in the ability of the city to get it enacted, an effort that began with the Bloomberg administration and was completed by Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Of course, \xe2\x80\x9cBig Plastic,\xe2\x80\x9d or whatever you want to call it \xe2\x80\x94 in this instance represented by the industry leader Dart Container Corporation and the trade group American Chemistry Council \xe2\x80\x94 fought hard against the measure, even successfully stalling it for a year in an attempt to demonstrate that the foam could be recycled. The city remained unconvinced, and the ban will take effect July 1, though it won\xe2\x80\x99t be enforced until next year.'b'Combine the surge in these bans with the probably more important and increasingly popular bans of \xe2\x80\x94 or taxes on \xe2\x80\x94 one-time-use plastic shopping bags, and you start to see a pattern: municipalities and sometimes even states are asserting themselves against the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d of industry to sell whatever it wants, and more of the public is willing to have government alter its behavior when the reasons are sound. (The just-passed soda tax in Berkeley fits into this pattern.) That combination is leading to victories for the environmental and public health movements, and it\xe2\x80\x99s changing people\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.'b'Plastic shopping bags are a visible and intractable nuisance as well as a long-term danger to health \xe2\x80\x94 the slowly degrading plastic leaches toxins into the environment for centuries \xe2\x80\x94 and a well-publicized threat to wildlife; 95 percent of the seabirds examined in one North Sea study had plastic in their stomachs. In clogging storm drains, they\xe2\x80\x99ve even been found to increase the danger of flooding. (You might read, or re-read, the 11-year-old 'b'Ian Frazier piece'b' in The New Yorker about snagging bags out of trees, which comes to mind whenever I see a bag stranded and waving from a limb or some barbed wire, or simply floating through the air like a balloon.) The collection of plastic bags costs taxpayers a bundle, roughly $25 million annually in California alone.'b'A statewide ban on plastic bags is on hold in that state, where, according to the environmental group Californians Against Waste, 400 of them are used per second. But they\xe2\x80\x99re still banned in over 130 jurisdictions, containing a third of California\xe2\x80\x99s population. They\xe2\x80\x99re also banned in 'b'dozens of other communities nationwide'b'. (Not New York City, though; a shame.) Perhaps more impressive is the global activity against plastic bags: in 2002, Ireland instituted a 15-euro cent tax per bag (it\xe2\x80\x99s now 22 euro cents), which helped reduce usage by 95 percent while raising money for recycling and waste reduction initiatives. Seeing this success, several European countries followed suit; Italy banned non-biodegradable plastic bags entirely, joining Rwanda, China, South Africa and other countries that have gotten rid of ultra-thin bags and begun charging customers for thicker plastic versions.'b'The California measure was to go into effect this July, but the American Progressive Bag Alliance, whose chief called the ban \xe2\x80\x9ca terrible piece of job-killing legislation\xe2\x80\x9d (even though a significant portion of the bags are produced in other states), appears to have forced a referendum. This 16-month delay will allow manufacturers to sell around 9 billion extra bags, 'b'worth as much as $145 million'b'. That\xe2\x80\x99s down from its pre-ban peak but still a staggering number when you consider almost all of them are used only once.'b'But the trends are clear: noxious, petroleum-based containers that 'b'do not lend themselves to recycling'b' and are easily replaced are on the way out, if not via national legislation or the Environmental Protection Agency then through local and state laws.'b'There is, however, another issue here, and that is changing culture. Plastic bags could, of course, be re-used, at least a little bit. Almost no one does that, because they\xe2\x80\x99re not especially sturdy, they\xe2\x80\x99re uncomfortable to carry and because we\xe2\x80\x99ve been trained to think of them as disposable.'b'But in a world that is continually being reminded that resources and landfill are limited, curbing products that waste both makes sense, not only for its direct effect but for its cultural changes. I saw this myself in the course of the last month, during which I\xe2\x80\x99ve been mostly in Berkeley.'b'Generally, I would call myself a modestly law-abiding recycler, or a half-hearted begrudging one, anyway. But in my first few trips to the supermarket in Berkeley I felt not exactly ashamed but out of step: nearly everyone was carrying their own bags into the store. And there I was, paying 10 cents for a paper bag.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a price I can afford to ignore, but within a week, I\xe2\x80\x99d joined the crowd. The reasons, I think, range from wanting to be part of the community to recognizing that it just isn\xe2\x80\x99t that onerous to walk down the street with an empty canvas bag. (It\xe2\x80\x99s even easier if the bag is in your car.)'b'Within another week, I was bringing once-used fruit-and-vegetable plastic bags back to the market to use again; I mean, why not? Which almost leads me to suggest that we start carrying re-usable containers for take-out food, as some people have begun to do for coffee. Yes, it\xe2\x80\x99s less convenient. But convenience isn\xe2\x80\x99t everything.'b'Political hostility in the United States is more and more becoming personal hostility. New findings suggest that the sources of dispute in contemporary life go far beyond ideological differences or mere polarization. They have become elemental, almost tribal, tapping into in-group loyalty and out-group enmity.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHostile feelings for the opposing party are ingrained or automatic in voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds,\xe2\x80\x9d Shanto Iyengar, a political scientist at Stanford, and Sean Westwood, a post-doctoral researcher at Princeton, wrote in a July 2014 paper \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Fear and Loathing Across Party Lines'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Partisans now discriminate against their adversaries \xe2\x80\x9cto a degree that exceeds discrimination based on race.\xe2\x80\x9d The authors find that this discrimination pervades decision making of all kinds, from hiring to marriage choices.'b'In a 'b'separate 2012 study'b', \xe2\x80\x9cAffect, Not Ideology,\xe2\x80\x9d Iyengar and two other colleagues used a polling method known as a \xe2\x80\x9cthermometer rating\xe2\x80\x9d to measure how Democrats and Republicans feel about each other. The temperature scale goes from 1 to 100. One means the respondent feels cold toward the group; 100 implies that the respondent has warm feelings. Iyengar and his colleagues found in 2008 that Democrat and Republican ratings of the opposition party had dropped to just below 32 degrees. In comparison, Protestants gave Catholics a 66 rating, Democrats gave \xe2\x80\x9cbig business\xe2\x80\x9d a 51, and Republicans rated \xe2\x80\x9cpeople on welfare\xe2\x80\x9d at 50.'b'One of the most striking findings of Iyengar\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 paper is the dramatic increase in the percentages of members of both parties who would be upset if their children married someone in the opposition party (shown in figure 1).'b'From 1960 to 2010, the percentage of Democrats and Republicans who said that members of their own party were more intelligent than those in the opposition party grew from 6 percent to 48 percent; the percentage describing members of the opposition party as \xe2\x80\x9cselfish\xe2\x80\x9d rose from 21 percent to 47 percent.'b'Iyengar and Westwood contend that the conflict between Democrats and Republicans is based more on deeply rooted \xe2\x80\x9cin group\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cout group\xe2\x80\x9d sensibilities than on ideology.'b'In an email exchange, Iyengar speculated on a number of reasons for the increase in polarization:'b'The result, according to Iyengar, is that \xe2\x80\x9csince inter-personal contact across the party divide is infrequent, it is easier for people to buy into the caricatures and stereotypes of the out party and its supporters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Iyengar\xe2\x80\x99s findings are backed up by a 2014 'b'Pew Research Center study'b' that revealed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe level of antipathy that members of each party feel toward the opposing party has surged over the past two decades.\xe2\x80\x9d Fully 36 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of Democrats believe the opposition party\xe2\x80\x99s policies \xe2\x80\x9care so misguided that they threaten the nation\xe2\x80\x99s well-being,\xe2\x80\x9d Pew found.'b'More recently, a group of four scholars working with Jonathan Haidt, a professor at New York University\xe2\x80\x99s Stern School of Business, and Thomas Talhelm, a doctoral candidate in social psychology at the University of Virginia, have developed a new line of inquiry into the causes and nature of polarization. Their paper, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Liberals Think More Analytically Than Conservatives'b',\xe2\x80\x9d was published online in December. It argues that'b'The answer, according to Talhelm, Haidt and their colleagues: \xe2\x80\x9cliberals and conservatives in the same country think as if they were from different cultures.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These researchers argue that liberals share a propensity for analytic thinking and have'b'Analytic thinking, in this view, \xe2\x80\x9cemphasizes slicing up the world and analyzing objects individually, divorced from context \xe2\x80\x94 much like scientific analysis requires thinkers to separate complex phenomena into separate parts.\xe2\x80\x9d Talhelm elaborated in a phone conversation: The analytic thinking typical of liberals is \xe2\x80\x9cmore conscious, more focused on the rules of logic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Conversely, these researchers define holistic thinking \xe2\x80\x93 which they consider more typical of conservatives \xe2\x80\x94 as \xe2\x80\x9cseeing scenes as a whole and seeing people as a product of situations.\xe2\x80\x9d Talhelm described this style of thought as \xe2\x80\x9cmore automatic, caught up in emotions, and in some ways less adherent to the rules of logic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Talhelm wrote me in an email that \xe2\x80\x9canalytic thinkers tend to do better in engineering, and they hold more patents for inventions. But holistic/intuitive thinkers tend to do better in more social fields, such as early childhood education and marketing.\xe2\x80\x9d One study in the 1960s, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cfound that analytic thinkers were more likely to have long hair (for men) and short skirts (women).\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In their 2014 paper, Talhelm and his co-authors'b'Conservatives, in this analysis, are more dedicated to their communities and to the idea of community than liberals. Conservatism, they write,'b'Talhelm and his colleagues suggest a different interpretation for the words \xe2\x80\x9cindividualism,\xe2\x80\x9d which traditionally is associated with conservatism, and \xe2\x80\x9ccollectivism,\xe2\x80\x9d which is often linked to liberalism:'b'Liberal individualism focuses on the self and personal fulfillment. As Talhelm put it:'b'Looking at the issue of partisan conflict in historical terms, Keith T. Poole, a political scientist at the University of Georgia, explained via email that polarization was very high before the Civil War, and again in the 1880s and 1890s \xe2\x80\x9cat the height of industrial capitalism\xe2\x80\x9d when the parties split over \xe2\x80\x9cgold vs. silver, taxes, tariffs, labor organization and inflation.\xe2\x80\x9d Starting in the 1960s, when race came to the forefront, Poole wrote, other issues involving nothing to do with economics \xe2\x80\x94 gun control, gay rights, sexual issues \xe2\x80\x94 began to be drawn into the \xe2\x80\x9cliberal\xe2\x80\x9d vs. \xe2\x80\x9cconservative\xe2\x80\x9d dimension. Now almost every issue from foreign policy to taxes to lifestyle issues has been drawn into the left vs. right alignment.'b'The work of Iyengar, Talhelm and Haidt adds a new layer to the study of polarization. In seminal work, scholars like Nolan McCarty, Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson, political scientists at Princeton, Yale and Berkeley, respectively, have stressed the key role of external factors in deepening our political schism, including inequality, the nationalization of politics, immigration and the fast approaching moment when whites will no longer be in the majority.'b'David Leege, political scientist emeritus at Notre Dame, provided further insight into the economic forces exacerbating polarization:'b'Iyengar, Talhelm and Haidt do not reject the importance of these external factors. But they do argue that the depth of our polarization reflects ingrained personal, cognitive and psychosocial traits \xe2\x80\x94 traits that are, in Iyengar\xe2\x80\x99s word, \xe2\x80\x9cprimal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is not an easy problem for politicians to solve. 'b'Republican'b' and 'b'Democratic'b' leaders are struggling to moderate their parties\xe2\x80\x99 most extreme ideological positioning. But if polarization reflects primal aspects of the human condition, particularly when we are under stress, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere. However much they might want to pitch themselves toward the center, politicians will feel the need to tap into the energy, not to mention the primary votes, that ideological purity provides. It is this contradiction between purity and pragmatism that will shape the political landscape for the foreseeable future.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Iranian Ayatollah Beseeches Western Youth on Islam'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (news article, Jan. 23) quotes Ayatollah Ali Khamenei advising Western youths to study the \xe2\x80\x9cteachings of the Prophet of Islam and his humane, ethical doctrines\xe2\x80\x9d in dealing with problems facing young people today.'b'The ayatollah appears to have conveniently forgotten his personal role and that of his entire regime in the treatment of the American hostages in the hostage crisis of 1979-81.'b'BRUCE LAINGEN'b'\nBethesda, Md., Jan. 23, 2015'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'The writer was charg\xc3\xa9 d\xe2\x80\x99affaires at the United States Embassy in Tehran during the hostage crisis.

Surely we can all agree that working to end child poverty \xe2\x80\x94 or at least severely reduce it \xe2\x80\x94 is a moral obligation of a civilized society.'b'And yet, 14.7 million children in this country are poor, and 6.5 million of them are extremely poor (living below half the poverty line).'b'Today, the 'b'Children\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Fund'b' is releasing a report entitled \xe2\x80\x9cEnding Child Poverty Now\xe2\x80\x9d that calls this country\xe2\x80\x99s rate of child poverty \xe2\x80\x9ca moral disgrace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the report points out:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s poor children did not ask to be born; did not choose their parents, country, state, neighborhood, race, color, or faith. In fact if they had been born in 33 other Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries they would be less likely to be poor. Among these 35 countries, America ranks 34th in relative child poverty \xe2\x80\x94 ahead only of Romania, whose economy is 99 percent smaller than ours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It points out many of the corrosive cruelties of childhood poverty: worse health and educational outcomes, impaired cognitive development and the effects of \xe2\x80\x9ctoxic stress\xe2\x80\x9d on brain functions.

The longer a child was poor, the greater the risk of adult poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the report is more than just an excoriation of the hollowness of our professed American values and our ethical quandary. It also serves as an economic manifesto, making the point that allowing child poverty to remain at these unconscionable levels costs \xe2\x80\x9cfar more than eliminating it would,\xe2\x80\x9d calculating that an immediate 60 percent reduction in child poverty would cost $77.2 billion a year, or just 2 percent of our national budget.'b'For context, the report puts it this way:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery year we keep 14.7 million children in poverty costs our nation $500 billion \xe2\x80\x94 six times more than the $77 billion investment we propose to reduce child poverty by 60 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The report cites the M.I.T. Nobel laureate economist and 2014 Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient Dr. Robert Solow, who wrote in his foreword to a 1994 C.D.F. report, \xe2\x80\x9cWasting America\xe2\x80\x99s Future\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cAs an economist I believe that good things are worth paying for; and that even if curing children\xe2\x80\x99s poverty were expensive, it would be hard to think of a better use in the world for money.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To pay for the effort, the report calls for some of the same things the president called for in his State of the Union speech last week, like closing tax loopholes and eliminating tax breaks for the wealthy. But it also called for a reduction in the military budget. This is an echo, in a way, of the concerns Martin Luther King had about military spending sapping money from efforts to help the poor, which he laid out in his not-nearly-cited-enough 1967 anti-Vietnam speech at the Riverside Church:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube. So I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What would we get for our $77 billion, anyway? Things like the creation of subsidized jobs, an increase in the earned income tax credit, a raise of the minimum wage, an expansion of child care subsidies and housing subsidies, and an increase in SNAP benefits.'b'The report holds up Britain, which took some of the same steps as a case study of how such an approach can work because they \xe2\x80\x9cmanaged to reduce child poverty by more than half over 10 years, and reductions persisted during the Great Recession.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We can do this too, if we just stop seeing helping these children as an us-versus-them struggle between makers and takers, if we stop getting so hung up on prudishness about sex and traditional views of what constitutes a family, if we stem our impulse to punish children for their mothers giving birth before marriage.'b'By the way, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-wedlock birthrate is even higher than ours.'b'When we think of Silicon Valley, we tend to imagine a world of extreme wealth and limitless opportunity.

I\xe2\x80\x99d endorse Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s comparison purely for the shock value: It draws attention to the awful things Putin is doing to Ukraine, not to mention his own country, whose credit rating was just reduced to junk status.'b'Putin\xe2\x80\x99s use of Russian troops wearing uniforms without insignia to invade Ukraine and to covertly buttress Ukrainian rebels bought and paid for by Moscow \xe2\x80\x94 all disguised by a web of lies that would have made Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels blush and all for the purpose of destroying Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s reform movement before it can create a democratic model that might appeal to Russians more than Putin\xe2\x80\x99s kleptocracy \xe2\x80\x94 is the ugliest geopolitical mugging happening in the world today.'b'Ukraine matters \xe2\x80\x94 more than the war in Iraq against the Islamic State, a.k.a., ISIS. It is still not clear that most of our allies in the war against ISIS share our values. That conflict has a big tribal and sectarian element. It is unmistakably clear, though, that Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s reformers in its newly elected government and Parliament \xe2\x80\x94 who are struggling to get free of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s orbit and become part of the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s market and democratic community \xe2\x80\x94 do share our values. If Putin the Thug gets away with crushing Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s new democratic experiment and unilaterally redrawing the borders of Europe, every pro-Western country around Russia will be in danger.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPutin fears a Ukraine that demands to live and wants to live and insists on living on European values \xe2\x80\x94 with a robust civil society and freedom of speech and religion [and] with a system of values the Ukrainian people have chosen and laid down their lives for,\xe2\x80\x9d Natalie Jaresko, Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s finance minister, told a Ukraine seminar at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last week.'b'The U.S. and Germany have done a good job organizing the sanctions on Russia. While the Obama administration recently decided to deploy some American soldiers to Ukraine in the spring to train the Ukrainian National Guard, I\xe2\x80\x99d support increasing our military aid to Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Army now so it can better defend itself from the estimated 9,000 troops Putin has infiltrated into Ukraine.'b'Ukraine also needs $15 billion in loans and grants in the next year to stabilize its economy, in addition to its bailout from the International Monetary Fund. Ukrainians had dug themselves into a deep, deep hole with their 20-plus years of industrial levels of corruption from a series of bad governments after Kiev became independent of the Soviet Union. The reason for hope is that the revolution and latest elections in Ukraine have brought in a new generation of reformers, who are rapidly transforming ministries and passing tax and transparency regulations. They are actually welcoming hardheaded, good-governance benchmarks as a condition for Western aid. But if they deliver, we must deliver.'b'Treasury Secretary Jack Lew has been traveling across Europe this week in part to lock in the aid package for Kiev. The U.S. has committed its share, but the European Union is still balking a bit. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s aim is to sow enough instability that the West will hold back aid so the Ukraine reformers will fail to deliver and be discredited. That would be a shame.'b'Global financier George Soros, who\xe2\x80\x99s been helping foster Ukrainian reform, told the Davos gathering that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a new Ukraine that is determined to be different from the old Ukraine. ... What makes it unique is that it is not only willing to fight but engage in executing a set of radical reforms. It is up against the old Ukraine that has not disappeared ... and up against a very determined design by President Putin to destabilize it and destroy it. But it is determined to assert the independence and European orientation of the new Ukraine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ukraine could also impact the price of oil. The two biggest actors who can shape that price today are Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s new king, Salman, and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s czar, Putin. If the Saudis decide to cut back production significantly, the price of oil will go up. And if Putin decides to fully invade Ukraine, or worse, one of the Baltic states, and test whether NATO will really fight to defend either, the price of oil will go up. With his economy in shambles, Putin\xe2\x80\x99s regime is now almost entirely dependent on oil and gas exports, so he\xe2\x80\x99s really hurting with the oil price collapse. The odds of Putin fully invading Ukraine or the Baltics are low, but do not rule out either.'b'Triggering a big geopolitical crisis with NATO is an easy way for Putin to shock the oil price back up. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s covert Ukraine interventions up to now have not succeeded in that. In sum: Today\xe2\x80\x99s oil price will be most affected by two men \xe2\x80\x94 King Salman and how he uses his spare capacity to produce oil and Czar Putin and how he uses his spare capacity to produce trouble.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'De Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s Flawed Vision of Liberalism'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 25), Noam Scheiber misses a crucial point about Mayor Bill de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the promiscuous use of stop-and-frisk against predominantly black and Latino young men. It has nothing to do with either \xe2\x80\x9cidentity politics\xe2\x80\x9d or liberalism. It has to do with constitutional rights.'b'The objection to how the police were using stop-and-frisk was that they were conducting unconstitutional searches, violating Supreme Court decisions and targeting victims based on skin color unrelated to reasonable suspicions of crime or possession of a gun. Such searches are illegal, and a federal court so found after an extensive trial.'b'This decision, and Mayor de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s support of it, were greeted with more applause among blacks and Latinos because they were the chief victims of the illegal police practices.'b'Any mayor, liberal or conservative, has an obligation to uphold the law. This should not be seen as a matter of identity politics.'b'IRA GLASSER'b'\nNew York, Jan. 25, 2015'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'The writer was executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union from 1978 to 2001.'b''b'Having failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act outright, congressional Republicans are moving ahead with plans to dismantle it piece by piece.'b'Earlier this month, the 'b'House passed a bill'b' that would undermine the so-called employer mandate, which requires certain employers to provide insurance or pay a penalty. In all, 240 Republicans and 12 Democrats voted for the bill while 172 Democrats voted against it. In the Senate, two Democrats recently joined dozens of Republicans to sponsor 'b'a similar measure'b'.'b'Like other attempts to weaken health care reform, the bill, named the Save American Workers Act, is based on false premises and offers false promises. But its bipartisan patina makes it a threat, as do the catchy if misleading assertions of its supporters to win public support.'b'At issue is the threshold at which the employer mandate kicks in. The law requires employers with 50 or more employees to provide insurance to those who work more than 30 hours a week, or pay a penalty of $2,000 to $3,000 per worker. Most of the roughly 230,000 companies with 50 or more workers already provide health insurance, while about 11,500 of such companies do not.'b'The House bill, however, would encourage many companies that provide insurance to stop doing so. It would require coverage (or a penalty) only for employees who work at least 40 hours a week, on the ground that 40 hours is the standard in employment law for a full-time worker. That is true but misses the point of the health care law, which sets a 30-hour threshold to ensure the broadest possible coverage without unduly burdening companies or taxpayers. The law is not intended to address employment-law standards. Turning the issue into an argument over the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfull time\xe2\x80\x9d is specious.'b'Republicans have also argued that a higher, 40-hour-a-week threshold would protect employees from having their hours cut by employers seeking to evade the coverage requirement. That\xe2\x80\x99s backward. A higher threshold would put more workers, not fewer, at risk of shortened workweeks. With a 30-hour threshold, the employees in danger of cutbacks are those who work around 30 to 34 hours a week, about 7 percent of the work force. With a 40-hour threshold, the employees in danger of cutbacks are those who work 40 hours or more a week, nearly half of the work force.'b'One thing Republicans don\xe2\x80\x99t say is that raising the hourly threshold 'b'would worsen the deficit'b' as more employees turn to publicly subsidized exchanges to find insurance.'b'President Obama has vowed to veto legislative attempts to weaken or undo the health reform law. But that could prove difficult if the measure were attached to other important legislation. The attacks on health reform are senseless, but the danger that they could weaken reform is real.'b''b' 'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Holding the Democratic Convention in Brooklyn?

Dir., Park Slope Fifth Avenue'b'\nBusiness Improvement District'b'\nBrooklyn, Jan. 21, 2015'b''b''b''b'Two former athletes at the University of North Carolina have 'b'filed a lawsuit'b' against their alma mater and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, accusing them of academic fraud. College athletes who sue for compensation is an old story. But, in this instance, Rashanda McCants, a former women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball player, and Devon Ramsay, who played football, are suing because, they say, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t receive a meaningful education. They are seeking class-action status, damages for some athletes and changes in academic oversight.'b'They have a credible case. In October, the university released a 'b'report'b' by Kenneth Wainstein, a former general counsel at the Federal Bureau of Investigation, finding that from 1993 to 2011 thousands of students, almost half of them athletes, took classes that did not require work or that didn\xe2\x80\x99t really exist. Students 'b'signed up'b' for \xe2\x80\x9cindependent study\xe2\x80\x9d courses in which they never met their professors and for lecture classes that never took place.'b'The failure to treat \xe2\x80\x9c'b'student-athletes'b'\xe2\x80\x9d as actual students goes beyond North Carolina. The lawyers representing Ms. McCants and Mr. Ramsay know that and take a swipe at the whole collegiate-athletic system: \xe2\x80\x9cThe N.C.A.A. and its member schools insist that their mission and purpose is to educate and to prevent the exploitation of college athletes,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'the lawsuit states'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cYet it is the schools, the conferences, and the N.C.A.A. that are engaging in exploitation, subverting the educational mission in the service of the big business of college athletics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though it has yet to comment, the N.C.A.A. is well aware that it has a problem: It is investigating 20 universities on suspicion of academic misconduct, according to 'b'The Chronicle of Higher Education'b'. At a convention this month, the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s president, Mark Emmert, said the association had to \xe2\x80\x9cemphasize the centrality of academic success as the touchstone for why we participate in collegiate athletics\xe2\x80\x9d and wondered whether it needed to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider new approaches \xe2\x80\x94 bolder, broader approaches?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That rhetoric sounds nice, but the N.C.A.A. has historically stood in the way of reform by perpetuating the myth that being a \xe2\x80\x9cstudent\xe2\x80\x9d is always compatible with being an \xe2\x80\x9cathlete.\xe2\x80\x9d A swimmer, for instance, might manage to split time between the library and the pool, but a quarterback at one of the Big Five conferences probably can\xe2\x80\x99t pull that off. The latter is an unpaid professional: He generates money for his coach, his athletic director, his university\xe2\x80\x99s administrators \xe2\x80\x94 everyone but himself \xe2\x80\x94 and is expected to practice up to 'b'50 hours a week'b' during the football season.'b'What happened at North Carolina is shameful but not surprising. Until the N.C.A.A. recognizes that some players are essentially professionals, universities will continue to treat their education like the fig leaf it is. Young people enticed by the fantasy that they can play and learn at a high level will continue to suffer the consequences.'b'SANA, Yemen \xe2\x80\x94 When I moved here in 2010, not a single gunman could be seen on the streets. Anti-gun laws were strictly enforced by the police, and violence was almost unknown.'b'Nowadays, I escort my wife to the supermarket armed with an automatic assault rifle and a 9-millimeter pistol. The number of spare magazines I carry depends on the gravity of the ever-escalating insecurity that plagues my city.'b'Last week, 'b'the government collapsed'b'. President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi resigned, as did his prime minister and the rest of the cabinet. The Houthis, a group of Shiite militants from the north who fought a bloody series of wars with the central government for over a decade, now effectively control the capital. Their flags fly on street corners, and armed militias operate checkpoints through the city.'b'While the takeover was shocking to foreign officials, for those of us here it was less surprising. After anti-government protests in 2011, Ali Abdullah Saleh, then the president, came under pressure from the United Nations and agreed to step down. Elections were held and Mr. Saleh\xe2\x80\x99s vice president, Mr. Hadi, the only candidate on the ballot, was elected president. Diplomats lauded this \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Yemen'b' model\xe2\x80\x9d of nonviolent political transition, and hailed it as an ideal process for other troubled Arab Spring states.'b'But in the eyes of its mother a monkey is a beautiful gazelle, a Yemeni proverb goes.'b'As the political transition meandered along, violence became dreadfully routine. The Yemeni state disintegrated in slow motion. The transition process, led by the United Nations envoy Jamal Benomar, was ill conceived, badly managed and, as the political vacuum in Sana attests, bound for failure.'b'Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'oil industry'b' has been almost shut down. Foreign investors, some of whom I have advised over the years, are pulling out. The Red Sea crude oil export pipeline has been blown up repeatedly by tribesmen from oil-rich Marib Province, irate that their demands for local development have been ignored by Mr. Hadi. Similar unresolved demands have provoked tribes in Hadhramaut to take control of oil fields. The kidnappings of foreigners and Yemenis for profit spiked tremendously. Symptomatic of the general lawlessness, over 100 officials have been assassinated, in what may be a result of conflicts between factions of the armed forces.'b'And worst of all, northern Yemen fell into a widespread state of war between the Houthis and the Yemeni military.'b'Throughout a six-month Houthi onslaught last year, Mr. Hadi refused to send army reinforcements to fight the Houthi militia in the north. Instead, he set up a series of mediation committees to try to arrange cease-fires as well as involve the Houthis in the political process.'b'This approach made sense to Mr. Hadi and the United Nations \xe2\x80\x94 they wanted to avoid outright civil war, and thought diplomacy would work.'b'But Yemen moves to a different rhythm. In our country\xe2\x80\x99s culture of tribalism, a party to a conflict must engage in the ritual of violence, if only for the sake of saving face, and leave it to third parties to negotiate. Mr. Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s repeated failure to punish Houthi aggression and his tepid calls for peace were read as weakness.'b'And so each cease-fire deal was broken by the Houthi militia with impunity: Within six months, the Yemeni state had lost control of huge amounts of their military hardware, as well as four northern provinces, to the Houthis.'b'Army leadership resented Mr. Hadi for his refusal to punish the Houthis, despite the deaths of hundreds of soldiers. That\xe2\x80\x99s why, in September, it was hardly a surprise when the Houthi militia entered Sana and established control. Military units refused to fight the Houthi advance, while others, perhaps sympathetic to the Houthi cause, were quietly supportive. The capital fell as Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s army gave Mr. Hadi a taste of his own policy of appeasement.'b'Mr. Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s government attempted a few more diplomatic contortions. Mr. Benomar arranged an 'b'agreement with the Houthis'b' but this was unrealistic. Violent clashes in the city, including one devastating suicide bombing that left over 35 dead, have been widely attributed to Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s local branch, which has also been rallying against the Houthis.'b'Since Mr. Hadi and the government resigned last week, the Houthis have tightened their control, placing Mr. Hadi and other ministers 'b'under house arrest'b'. Government officials in Hadhramaut, Shabwah, Marib, Aden and other provinces are no longer taking orders from Sana. It seems Mr. Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s resignation has caught the Houthis by surprise; even they didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect it to be this easy to seize power. We wait again as the United Nations envoy mounts frantic bids to arrange a new political agreement.'b'Meanwhile, no one is in charge in the capital. Supermarket parking lots are filled with heavily armed guards, and customers walk the aisles with guns slung over their shoulders. Most taxi drivers in Sana have a pistol tucked under their seat.'b'Ultimately, Mr. Hadi\xe2\x80\x99s government collapsed through a series of grievous omissions: inaction in the face of powerful militias, unwillingness to impose law and security all over the country, and a failure to improve the lives of ordinary Yemenis. Mr. Hadi and the United Nations were not able to create the change that Yemenis took to the streets for in 2011.'b'The Yemen model has been replaced by the Houthi model, with its simple adage: Violence pays.'b''b' 'b''b'Haykal Bafana'b', 'b' a lawyer, is the managing director of Bafana Advisory, a firm that guides companies on investment in Yemen.

Newspaper headlines around the world suggest that the government is somehow responsible for one of these tragedies or both. I don\xe2\x80\x99t buy it.'b'Before he was found with a bullet in his head, Mr. Nisman had spent almost a decade investigating the worst terrorist attack in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s history \xe2\x80\x94 the bombing of the Jewish community center in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people in July 1994. His death shocked the country and deflected attention from his 290-page accusatory affidavit. The opposition saw the congressional hearing as a weapon against the government; the ruling party, meanwhile, was preparing to poke holes in the affidavit.'b'The media is now leaking fragments of 5,000 hours of intelligence wiretaps, in which neither the president nor the foreign minister make an appearance. Also, rumors abound about whether Mr. Nisman was murdered or killed himself.'b'Mrs. Kirchner has flip-flopped between assuming it was a suicide and, later, suggesting it was not. It is an election year and although she cannot run for another term, her vacillating has not helped her party.'b'Speculation aside, it is important to question the accuracy of the charges made in the affidavit itself, which points a finger at Iran. The document, which has been published online in Spanish, is self-contradictory.'b'First, it accuses Mr. Timerman \xe2\x80\x94 a Jew who was once the victim of the anti-Semitic dictatorship that kidnapped and tortured his father \xe2\x80\x94 of seeking to revoke the Interpol Red Notices, or arrest warrants, against the accused Iranians. Then it cites a wiretap, in which an alleged Iranian agent denounces Mr. Timerman with anti-Semitic epithets for not revoking the red notices.'b'Mr. Nisman was rebuked for this claim by a man he had praised \xe2\x80\x94 the former secretary general of Interpol, Ronald K. Noble. The affidavit repeats 96 times that Mrs. Kirchner and Mr. Timerman tried to get the Interpol warrants against the accused Iranians revoked. But Mr. Noble, who oversaw the warrants, denies this and says Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s leaders consistently did the opposite.'b'In an interview on Jan. 18, Mr. Noble declared: \xe2\x80\x9cNisman\xe2\x80\x99s claims are false.\xe2\x80\x9d The same day, Mr. Nisman was found dead.'b'It is strange that an experienced prosecutor like Mr. Nisman would prepare such a weak document if his goal was to level serious accusations against the president and foreign minister. Of the 290 pages, only two mentioned possible violations of the law, and there was no reference at all to legal doctrine or jurisprudence. Consequently, many people believe that the document wasn\xe2\x80\x99t written by a lawyer and that Mr. Nisman was misled and used.'b'The key to the story is not likely to be found in the present government, but rather in former president Carlos Menem\xe2\x80\x99s administration. Mr. Menem is of Syrian descent, and before Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s 1989 presidential election, he met in Damascus with the Syrian leader, Hafez al-Assad, who had backed him financially. Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s participation in Operation Desert Storm against Syria\xe2\x80\x99s ally, Iraq, in 1991, spoiled this romance. Then, in 1992, the Israeli embassy in Argentina was attacked and in 1994 the Jewish community center was bombed.'b'Secret documents that were declassified in 2003 revealed that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, sent a personal envoy to Argentina just hours after the 1994 attack to agree on a common interpretation of events to present to the press. At the time, Mr. Rabin was facing political pressure at home from opponents of the Oslo peace talks with the Palestinians, which were for the first time occurring with Syrian approval.'b'After his meeting with Mr. Menem, Mr. Rabin\xe2\x80\x99s envoy accused Iran of the attack. The same week, a spokesman from the State Department in Washington went further and excluded Syria from the list of suspects.'b'Mr. Menem also found it politically convenient to look away from Syria, and he did all he could to prevent the Syrian angle from being investigated, due to his previous  relationship with the Assad government and his unfulfilled promises to Syria of diplomatic support and cooperation on nuclear and missile technology.'b'Today, Mr. Menem is on trial alongside some of his cabinet members from that era, as well as a judge and two prosecutors accused of obstructing justice and covering up evidence about the 1994 attack.'b'My organization, the Center for Legal and Social Studies, represents a group of the victims of the attack. In 2005, N\xc3\xa9stor C. Kirchner, Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s president at the time, recognized the state\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for failing to prevent the bombing or solve the crime.'b'A settlement was agreed upon in which the government promised to modify Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s intelligence law to prevent interference with the judiciary. It took almost a decade before Mr. Kirchner\xe2\x80\x99s widow, now leading the country, began to fulfill that commitment.'b'Last December, Mrs. Kirchner finally appeared to act on her late husband\xe2\x80\x99s promise by ousting the Intelligence Service\xe2\x80\x99s top brass in an overdue attempt to clean house. Mr. Nisman\xe2\x80\x99s death could have been blowback; many believe that the ousted intelligence operations chief, Antonio Stiuso, fed Mr. Nisman the affidavit and might have been involved in his death.'b'According to the affidavit, the Memorandum of Understanding that Argentina and Iran signed in January 2013 facilitated a cover-up, the secret goal of which was to enable Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s purchase of Iranian oil \xe2\x80\x94 something highly unlikely because of the high sulfur content of Iranian oil, six times the amount allowed by Argentine refineries. But the memorandum\xe2\x80\x99s actual purpose was to allow a judge to interrogate the accused Iranians and to set up an International Truth Commission, composed of prestigious jurists from other countries.'b'Signing a memorandum with the  na\xc3\xafve illusion that it might one day bring the accused before a tribunal, as with Libya and the 1988 Lockerbie bombing case, does not constitute a crime. Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s government doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know who is guilty, but it wants to permit the judiciary to find out.'b'Mr. Nisman\xe2\x80\x99s death and the ongoing uncertainly about the 1994 attack have exposed the flaws in Argentina\xe2\x80\x99s justice system and its promiscuous relationship with the intelligence establishment.'b'The promised reforms cannot be postponed any longer. Argentina needs more transparency, more oversight of intelligence services and the severing of inappropriate ties between spies, judges and prosecutors.'b'Mrs. Kirchner announced the dissolution of the Intelligence Secretariat and the creation of a federal intelligence agency earlier this week.

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio? This time, it was the strange revelation that, on Monday afternoon, when Mr. Cuomo made the call to shut the subways down, the mayor of New York found out only a few minutes before the rest of the public did.'b'Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s people say they had no intention to freeze out the mayor \xe2\x80\x94 that it was just a crazy day, the forecast since the night before had been for dangerous winds and deep snowdrifts, and that almost as soon as the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Thomas Prendergast, made the shutdown recommendation to Mr. Cuomo, on Monday at 4:15 p.m., City Hall learned about it, on a 4:30 conference call. And Mr. de Blasio himself agrees that the subway closing call was the right one, given what the forecasters were saying. He only wished he\xe2\x80\x99d been told sooner.'b'Beyond that, it seems Mr. Cuomo never picked up the phone, if only for the courtesy: \xe2\x80\x9cHey, Bill, heads-up, we need to shut the subways down. What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not that the mayor had any real authority over the matter. Contrary to what a lot of people think, the governor runs the subways, which are part of the M.T.A., a creature of New York State government.'b'But the mayor is responsible for his city \xe2\x80\x94 and held to be so by all of his constituents. And the city has a right to wonder why its leaders were not involved, even as interested bystanders, in discussions whose outcomes affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.'b'In a region of many neighboring and overlapping jurisdictions, when emergencies ignore political borderlines, the public can only benefit when leaders speak to \xe2\x80\x94 and with \xe2\x80\x94 one another. Remember the time last year when Mr. Cuomo and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey together declared a 'b'mandatory quarantine'b' for returning Ebola health care workers? That decision was tightly coordinated; Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie spoke like brothers-in-arms. But they also infuriated New York City health officials, who had not been informed, and had no chance to block or weigh in on the policy, except after the fact to call it foolish, which it was.'b'No one will ever say that Mr. Cuomo is anything but a take-charge executive in a crisis. The commander in chief of the Empire State is not one to snooze through an emergency or delegate hard jobs to underlings.'b'But at moments like this \xe2\x80\x94 as with the Ebola overreaction, and Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s alpha-male tussling with Mr. de Blasio over issues like prekindergarten \xe2\x80\x94 we all have a right to ask why the governor and the mayor always have to seem as if they are in a contest for who is the most powerful person in the room.'b'In 'b'my last column'b', I wrote about a high school buddy, Kevin Green, a warm and helpful man who floundered in a tough job market, hurt his back and died at the age of 54. The column was a call for empathy for those who are struggling, but, predictably, scolds complained that Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s problems were of his own making.'b'Grrrr.'b'So what do we know about empathy and how to nurture it?'b'First, it seems hard-wired. 'b'Even laboratory rats'b' will sometimes free a trapped companion before munching on a food treat.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cProbably the biggest empathy generator is cuteness: paedomorphic features such as large eyes, a large head, and a small lower face,\xe2\x80\x9d Steven Pinker, the Harvard psychologist, tells me. \xe2\x80\x9cProfessional empathy entrepreneurs have long known this, of course, which is why so many charities feature photos of children and why so many conservation organizations feature pandas. Prettier children are more likely to be adopted, and baby-faced defendants get lighter sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not much we can do about looks \xe2\x80\x94 although criminal defense lawyers try, by having scruffy clients shave and dress up before appearing in court.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also some research suggesting that wealth may impede empathy. 'b'One study by psychologists at the University of California at Berkeley'b' finds that drivers of luxury cars are more likely to cut off other motorists and ignore pedestrians at a crosswalk. Likewise, 'b'heart rates of wealthier research subjects'b' are less affected when they watch a video of children with cancer.'b'Granted, skepticism is reasonable any time (mostly liberal) academics reach conclusions that portray the wealthy in a poor light. But these experiments also find a measure of backing in the real world. For example, among Democratic politicians, personal wealth is a predictor of supporting legislation that would increase inequality, 'b'according to a journal article last year'b' by Michael W. Kraus and Bennett Callaghan.'b'Likewise, the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans give significantly less to charity as a fraction of income (1.4 percent) than the poorest 20 percent do (3.5 percent), according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.'b'That may be partly because affluence insulates us from need, so that disadvantage becomes theoretical and remote rather than a person in front of us. Wealthy people who live in economically diverse areas 'b'are more generous'b' than those who live in exclusively wealthy areas.'b'Wealth may also turn us inward. Some experiments manipulated research subjects to think of money \xe2\x80\x94 such as by having them gaze at a pile of Monopoly money and imagine great wealth \xe2\x80\x94 and found that when a person then \xe2\x80\x9caccidentally\xe2\x80\x9d spilled pencils nearby, 'b'those thinking of great wealth were less helpful'b' than those imagining tight budgets and picked up fewer pencils from the floor.'b'So how do we increase empathy?'b'Dacher Keltner, who runs 'b'the Greater Good Science Center'b' at the University of California at Berkeley, says that having people think about suffering activates the vagus nerve, which is linked to compassion. He also cites evidence that uplifting stories about sacrifice boost empathy, as do various kinds of contemplation \xe2\x80\x94 prayer, meditation, yoga.'b'Keltner says that going out into nature also appears to encourage greater compassion. Feelings of awe, such as those generated by incredible images from space, seem to do the same thing, he says.'b'Professor Pinker, 'b'in his superb book'b' \xe2\x80\x9cThe Better Angels of Our Nature,\xe2\x80\x9d explores whether the spread of affordable fiction and journalism beginning in the 18th century expanded empathy by making it easier for people to imagine themselves in the shoes of others. 'b'Researchers have found that reading literary fiction'b' by the likes of Don DeLillo or Alice Munro \xe2\x80\x94 but not beach fiction or nonfiction \xe2\x80\x94 can promote empathy.'b'I used to be cynical about student service projects, partly because they seemed so often to be about dressing up a college application, and trips so often involve countries with great beaches. (Everyone wants to help Costa Rica!) Then there was The Washington Post\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'report about the Mexican church that was painted six times'b' over the course of a summer by successive waves of visitors.'b'Yet I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to believe that service trips do open eyes and remind students of their good fortune. In short, they build empathy.'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s escape the insulation of our comfort zones. Let\xe2\x80\x99s encourage student service projects and travel to distant countries and to needy areas nearby. Whatever the impact on others, volunteering may at least help the volunteer. Let\xe2\x80\x99s teach Dickens and DeLillo in schools, along with literature that humanizes minority groups and builds understanding.'b'Above all, let\xe2\x80\x99s remember that compassion and rationality are not effete markers of weakness, but signs of civilization.'b'TOO often the debate over how to restart Europe\xe2\x80\x99s economy veers into the conveniently crisp alternatives of stimulus versus austerity. Should the pressure to reduce government deficits be relaxed? Should central bank actions to lower interest rates have come sooner and been more aggressive?'b'That simplistic debate has returned to the forefront, with the European Central Bank\xe2\x80\x99s plunge into purchasing the sovereign debt of its member nations and Greece\xe2\x80\x99s resounding vote at the ballot box against spending cuts.'b'But the focus on macroeconomic policy underappreciates the critical importance of smaller structural problems that collectively amount to a bigger challenge for Europe.'b'Archaic restrictions on hiring and firing workers, flawed energy policies and kilometers of red tape that can make even starting a business difficult \xe2\x80\x94 just to name a few \xe2\x80\x94 have combined to damage the Continent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to compete in increasingly global markets.'b'Among major countries, France and Italy have these problems most acutely, with wages continuing to rise even as the efficiency of workers has stagnated.'b'In France, President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande arrived in office in 2012 atop a leftist wave and responded with policies that ranged from lowering the retirement age to 60 to raising corporate and value-added taxes.'b'His policies have even managed to get French businessmen into the street, shouting \xe2\x80\x9cenough is enough\xe2\x80\x9d into megaphones \xe2\x80\x94 an expression of their frustration with the layers of regulations, such as a new requirement that all part-time jobs be at least 24 hours per week. Unpopular and under pressure from the European Union, Mr. Hollande has tacked modestly toward the center.'b'Meanwhile, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s youthful new prime minister, Matteo Renzi, arrived determined to reverse three years of recession by overhauling problems such as rigid labor laws and a grindingly slow judicial system.'b'After months of battling, he recently made progress on a bank reform bill and secured initial passage of his jobs act. That occasioned demonstrations and strikes across the country by workers who feared that it would succeed in dismantling Italy\xe2\x80\x99s 2,700 pages of labor market regulations, which effectively institutionalized inefficiency by making it exceptionally difficult to fire workers.'b'Even generally sensible Germany has veered wildly off course in its energy policy. In the wake of the 2011 nuclear disaster at Fukushima in Japan, the country, which derived about a quarter of its energy from low-cost nuclear power, has begun shutting down its reactors. That came on top of a requirement that utilities purchase specified amounts of clean power at prices far higher than electricity from conventional sources.'b'A result is weakened competitiveness for Germany\xe2\x80\x99s much-vaunted industrial sector and suggestions by businessmen that new facilities requiring large amounts of power may be located in more hospitable countries.'b'More positively, Spain, while still plagued by an unemployment rate of 23.7 percent, has managed to implement labor and tax reforms, helping the country to begin adding jobs again amid renewed economic growth.'b'With all the problems facing Europe, the recent European Central Bank decision to buy bonds amounts to reaching into a medicine cabinet when the patient needs open-heart surgery.'b'For one thing, high interest rates are hardly Europe\xe2\x80\x99s problem. France can borrow at 0.6 percent for 10 years, and even Spain and debt-laden Italy can borrow at around 1.5 percent.'b'And despite robust European Central Bank financing programs, loan demand from the private sector remains weak. Since 2008, business investment has dropped about 15 percent.'b'Many explanations are offered for why the eurozone is lagging. Some say it\xe2\x80\x99s lack of immigration. Sure, the United States has benefited enormously from the diversity and productivity of newcomers. But with 11.5 percent unemployment, the eurozone wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to need more workers.'b'Income inequality? Unlike the United States, where inequality has soared, on the Continent, the gap between the haves and the have-nots, although large, has widened only modestly.'b'To be sure, in the appropriate context, more public spending and investment and commendable efforts to avoid deflation, like those of the European Central Bank, would be well advised.'b'But under the present circumstances, such steps risk distracting the Continent even further from addressing its most serious challenges.'b'Europe needs to become more competitive in global markets. That can be achieved only by a variety of policy changes, such as keeping top tax rates at sensible levels and regulatory reforms that would give companies more freedom to manage their businesses as they see fit, including, when necessary, closing plants and reducing head counts. That is the only viable path to sustainable growth and, ultimately, more jobs.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c 'b'\xe2\x80\x98Discrimination With a Smile\xe2\x80\x99'b' \xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 22): Regardless of intent, effect should always be scrutinized and punished when deemed appropriate.

Commanders in Afghanistan informed the inspector general\xe2\x80\x99s office that they had decided to classify the bulk of that data. The decision came after the military, late last year, classified a periodic report that the inspector general has used over the years as the primary source to assess the state of Afghan forces. The stated reason? It could give the enemy the upper hand.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith lives literally on the line, I am sure that you can join me in recognizing that we must be careful to avoid providing sensitive information to those that threaten our forces and Afghan forces, particularly information that can be used by such opposing forces to sharpen their attacks,\xe2\x80\x9d Gen. John Campbell, the American commander in Afghanistan, wrote to the inspector general, John Sopko, on Jan. 18.'b'The threats that Afghan and American troops face in Afghanistan remain all too real. But it strains credulity to believe that insurgents would become more proficient fighters by poring over lengthy inspector general reports about an increasingly forgotten war. Classifying that information unreasonably prevents American taxpayers from drawing informed conclusions about the returns on a $107.5 billion reconstruction investment that, adjusted for inflation, has surpassed the price tag of the Marshall Plan.'b''b'Mr. Sopko'b', a former prosecutor who takes great pleasure in needling bureaucrats, has at times gone overboard in 'b'his protests'b' over the state of reconstruction projects.

I had a great phone conversation with Trapnell about drones, a.k.a. unmanned aerial vehicles. It led me to conclude that, like so many other things in American society, this is a matter about which people differ depending on whether they live in a crowded place or an empty place.'b'Empty, like North Dakota, and you think of a flying camera doing crop inspections. Maybe an Amazon drone arriving at your house on the prairie with the espresso maker you just ordered.'b'Crowded, and you imagine a mini-helicopter crashing through your apartment window. Or hitting a light pole and falling down on a baby in a stroller. Or running into a plane, which has nearly happened on several occasions.'b'Even the much-heralded promise of drone-delivered pizza sounds awful if you envision hundreds of pies smashing into one another over Brooklyn every Friday night.'b'But about the drunk droner. This saga starred an off-duty employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency who had been drinking at an apartment not far from the White House when he decided, in the middle of the night, to try out a friend\xe2\x80\x99s drone. He then quickly lost control of the little fellow, which crash-landed in what is at least theoretically the most heavily protected lawn in the United States.'b'The public conversation instantly turned to terrorism and whether a maniac could use a recreational drone to drop a bomb, or start a chemical attack. This is a terrible worry. But at least we have multitudes of dedicated, vigilant public servants, virtually all of them totally sober, working night and day to make sure this kind of thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.'b'However, we\xe2\x80\x99re not giving enough attention to the threat of normal American idiots.

Commercial drone uses are theoretically prohibited, but there\xe2\x80\x99s a widespread feeling that in the absence of rules, anything goes.'b'Take Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, whose wedding photographer had a drone taking pictures during the happy occasion. When critics accused him of violating F.A.A. rules, Maloney said he \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t up-to-date on the lack of regulations around the emerging technology.\xe2\x80\x9d The same thing was true, the congressman argued, of \xe2\x80\x9cmost people who are about to get married.\xe2\x80\x9d Excellent point!

Instead, he suggests turning attention to the conflict between Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, which remains unresolved because of Azerbaijan\xe2\x80\x99s revanchist aspirations.'b'Apparently, the recent increase in bloody attacks against Nagorno-Karabakh is how the Azeri leadership has chosen to distract attention, both domestic and international, from its suppression of liberties and dissent. The Azeri leadership must realize that by doing so it only deepens the gap with the international community, and delays a solution of the regional problems.'b'Azerbaijan must stop using pretexts, including military provocations, to justify domestic shortcomings. Existence of the democratic Nagorno-Karabakh Republic proves that true democracy is possible, even in conditions of a permanent threat of foreign aggression.'b'The people and democratically elected government of my country, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, are interested in peace, prosperity and democracy in all regional states, including neighboring Azerbaijan.'b'ROBERT AVETISYAN'b'\nWashington, Jan. 23, 2015'b''b''b' 'b''b''b'The writer is the representative of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic to the United States. 'b''b'Many Republicans have no fondness for net neutrality \xe2\x80\x94 the idea that cable and phone companies should treat all information equally as it travels over their broadband Internet networks. So it comes as no surprise that some of them are trying to throw a wrench into the Federal Communications Commission\xe2\x80\x99s plan to adopt strong Internet rules.'b'Republicans and large telecommunications companies are natural allies in opposing government regulations. Now, two Republican lawmakers, Senator John Thune of South Dakota and Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, have 'b'proposed a bill'b' that they claim would achieve neutrality on the Internet without the kind of regulation the F.C.C. is expected to approve next month. But the legislation has such large loopholes that powerful cable and phone companies like Comcast and Verizon would feel almost no effect.'b'Mr. Thune and Mr. Upton say'b' their bill 'b' would forbid the cable and phone companies from giving preference to traffic from certain businesses, like Amazon and Google, that are willing to pay more for faster delivery, which would hurt smaller companies. The legislation would also prohibit such companies from blocking or slowing downloads from certain sites.'b'Those are excellent goals, but there is a giant caveat in the bill: Companies would be allowed to offer \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized services\xe2\x80\x9d that would not be subject to any of those rules. Conceivably, almost anything could be called a \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized service,\xe2\x80\x9d which is really just linguistic sleight of hand.'b'The bill would also prohibit the F.C.C. from classifying broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service, something the commission has been 'b'moving closer to'b' in recent months. Courts have ruled that the commission now has limited authority to regulate broadband, but the telecommunications designation \xe2\x80\x94 which already applies to home phone lines and cellphone service \xe2\x80\x94 would give the commission the authority it needs to prohibit companies from engaging in unfair and unreasonable business practices. The chairman of the F.C.C., Tom Wheeler, 'b'recently suggested'b' that the agency would vote on Feb. 26 to reclassify broadband.'b'The good news is that even if Republicans in Congress, who receive 'b'big donations'b' from telecommunications companies, can push through Mr. Thune\xe2\x80\x99s and Mr. Upton\xe2\x80\x99s legislation, President Obama would almost surely veto it. 'b'In November'b', the president 'b'called on'b' the F.C.C. to reclassify broadband. But Republicans could try to get the proposal through by attaching it to unrelated bills the president would find difficult to veto. Democrats in Congress and President Obama should be ready to defend the F.C.C.'b'ROCHESTER, Minn. \xe2\x80\x94 PRESIDENT OBAMA\xe2\x80\x99S new budget is expected to include hundreds of millions of dollars for so-called precision medicine. The initiative, which he introduced last week in his State of the Union address, has bipartisan support and is a bright spot in the otherwise tight funding environment for medical research. Unfortunately, precision medicine is unlikely to make most of us healthier.'b'The basic idea behind it is that we each have genetic variants that put us at increased or decreased risk of getting various diseases, or that make us more or less responsive to specific treatments. If we can read someone\xe2\x80\x99s genetic code, then we should be able to provide him or her with more effective therapeutic and preventive strategies.'b'But for most common diseases, hundreds of genetic risk variants with small effects have been identified, and it is hard to develop a clear picture of who is really at risk for what. This was actually one of the major and unexpected findings of the Human Genome Project. In the 1990s and early 2000s, it was thought that a few genetic variants would be found to account for a lot of disease risk. But for widespread diseases like diabetes, heart disease and most cancers, no clear genetic story has emerged for a vast majority of cases.'b'Age, sex, body weight and a few simple blood tests are much better predictors of Type 2 diabetes, for example, than a genetic score based on how many snippets of \xe2\x80\x9crisky\xe2\x80\x9d DNA you have. And the advice for those at risk to exercise more and eat more healthfully remains the same.'b'When higher-risk genetic variants are found, their predictive power is frequently dependent on environment, culture and behavior. The main genetic variant associated with obesity, for instance, is associated with obesity only in people born after the early 1940s \xe2\x80\x94 most likely because of the low-physical-activity, high-calorie world that emerged after World War II.'b'A second unexpected finding of the Human Genome Project was the problem of \xe2\x80\x9cmissing heritability.\xe2\x80\x9d While the statistics suggest that there is a genetic explanation for common conditions and diseases running in families or populations, it turns out that the information on genetic variants doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explain that increased risk.'b'Several high-profile attempts to use genetic variants to target patients with commonly used drug therapies have also failed in clinical trials. Perhaps the most notable example is the anticoagulant warfarin, which is used by millions of patients to prevent blood clots and strokes. Researchers have found that genetic information on how patients metabolize drugs does not improve on the standard way of adjusting the dose up or down, based on factors like age, weight and blood test results.'b'For relatively rare diseases like cystic fibrosis, exciting new drugs have been developed using genetic information, but they have not been able to fix defective genes via gene therapy, as originally hoped. There have also been positive reports about precision therapies for specific genetic defects in cancer, but it\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to design clinical trials to test this strategy in a large number of patients. Many tumors are also notorious for their ability to mutate and ultimately circumvent the best therapies.'b'The push toward precision medicine could also lead to unintended consequences based on how humans respond to perceptions of risk. There is evidence that if people believe they are less at risk for a given disease, they feel excessively protected and their behavior gets worse, putting them at increased risk. Likewise, those who feel they are at greater risk, even if the increased risk is small, might become fatalistic, making their behavior worse as well. Then there are the worriers, who might embark on a course of excessive tests and biopsies \xe2\x80\x9cjust in case.\xe2\x80\x9d In a medical system already marked by the overuse of diagnostic tests and procedures, this could lead to even more wasteful spending.'b'We have been down this road before. The idea behind the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on cancer\xe2\x80\x9d was that a deep understanding of the basic biology of cancer would let us develop targeted therapies and cure the disease. Unfortunately, although we know far more today than we did 40-plus years ago, the statistics on cancer deaths have remained incredibly stubborn. The one bright spot has been tobacco control \xe2\x80\x94 again highlighting the dominant role of culture, environment and behavior versus biological destiny in what ails most of us.'b'Given the general omert\xc3\xa0 about researchers\xe2\x80\x99 criticizing funding initiatives, you probably won\xe2\x80\x99t hear too many objections from the research community about President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plan for precision medicine. But I am deeply skeptical. Like most \xe2\x80\x9cmoonshot\xe2\x80\x9d medical research initiatives, precision medicine is likely to fall short of expectations. Medical problems and their underlying biology are not linear engineering exercises, and solving them is more than a matter of vision, money and will.'b'We would be better off directing more resources to understanding what it takes to solve messy problems about how humans behave as individuals and in groups. Ultimately, we almost certainly have more control over how much we exercise, eat, drink and smoke than we do over our genomes.'b'SANTA BARBARA, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Every Cuban knows the \xe2\x80\x9cwet foot, dry foot\xe2\x80\x9d drill: Risk fleeing to the United States and get caught at sea, and you will be sent back to the island; but if you wangle just one toe onto dry land, you\xe2\x80\x99re home free. From there, typically, it\xe2\x80\x99s a fast track to permanent residency, and eligibility for all manner of benefits, from green cards to welfare, then citizenship \xe2\x80\x94 all compliments of the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. Indeed, for almost a half century, Cubans have been the most privileged immigrants in the United States.'b'The repeal of this Cold War relic of immigration policy is long overdue. Last week, on the same day that the highest-level American diplomat in almost 40 years arrived in Cuba, the Miami-Dade County Commission unanimously voted to petition Congress to revise the act. Should the commission get its wish, the \xe2\x80\x9cwet foot, dry foot\xe2\x80\x9d policy, devised in 1995, would likely also be upended.'b'Most Americans are under the impression that the Republican Party is unequivocally opposed to amnesty for immigrants. In fact, it has long backed a blanket amnesty \xe2\x80\x94 but only for Cubans. For every other hopeful immigrant, the party\xe2\x80\x99s message has been clear: \xe2\x80\x9cDeportations, deportations, deportations,\xe2\x80\x9d to quote Jorge Ramos, the Walter Cronkite of Spanish-language television. Why?'b'One answer is that the 2.1 million Cuban-Americans have been, until quite recently, a rock-solid Republican constituency. There is also a race and class issue. Unlike most of Central and Latin America, Cuba does not have a distinct indigenous population (the Spanish slaughtered almost all of the native Indians of the island). Hence those fleeing the Castro regime in the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s were almost entirely white, educated and middle or upper class.'b'In 2014, the number of Central and Latin American migrants sharply declined. But for Cubans, it was a record year. About 30,000 took to the Florida Straits or arrived via Mexico (the preferred route for those who can afford the flight). Unlike the Mexicans, Guatemalans, Salvadorans and Haitians \xe2\x80\x94 most of whom received the heave-ho \xe2\x80\x94 each Cuban was welcome.'b'Word, and worry, has spread that the two pieces of legislation that make up the Cuban Privilege might not be around much longer. Since Dec. 17, when President Obama re-established relations with Cuba, the waters between the two countries have been swarming with migrants.'b'Last month, 481 Cubans were intercepted or rescued from jury-rigged rafts and boats \xe2\x80\x94 a 117 percent increase from the previous year, according to the Coast Guard. Many are not so lucky. Some migrants try five or 10 times before they successfully cross the 90 miles of water. How many have not made it? Thousands for sure over the last 50 years \xe2\x80\x94 making the Florida Straits one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest aquatic graveyards.'b"Cuban authorities have demanded an end to the Cuban Adjustment Act, claiming the policy causes a brain drain. (Of course, they never acknowledge why more than a million Cubans have risked their lives to escape.) The vote in Miami last week had different motivations: Commissioner Bruno Barreiro, whose family members were beneficiaries of the act, argued that the Castro brothers have long exploited the law to ship out dissidents and to infiltrate spies into the exile community. And El Exilio Historico (the old guard) complains that the new arrivals are economic migrants, not political refugees fleeing communism \xe2\x80\x94 the law\xe2\x80\x99s raison d'\xc3\xaatre."b'While all this is true, there are more compelling reasons to end the Cuban Privilege. One of them is fairness. Are Cubans seeking a better way of life really more deserving than, say, refugees fleeing death squads or drug cartels?'b'Another is its enabling of a veritable crime syndicate: According to a 'b'recent series in The Sun Sentinel'b', a small cadre of Cubans specializing in Medicare and insurance fraud have bilked American taxpayers and businesses out of more than $2 billion since 1994. Even when caught and prosecuted (many, if not most, flee back to Cuba before capture), they cannot be deported, because Cuba refuses to accept them.'b'It is not at all clear if these two relics of immigration policy will be scotched; the State Department has said they are not on the table. Much depends on the Hispanics in Congress, whose colleagues expect them to take the lead. But the three serving in the Senate happen to be, yup, Cuban-American: Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Robert Menendez.'b'None have especially strong bona fides among most Latinos. Indeed, being second-generation white Cuban exiles puts them at odds with the overwhelming majority of Latinos in the United States, who are of mixed race or indigenous descent. Ted Cruz, who is not fluent in Spanish, has been called as Hispanic \xe2\x80\x9cas Tom Cruise.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2012, 'b'an anti-Rubio commercial'b' on Spanish-language TV ended with the tag \xe2\x80\x9cNo Somos Rubios\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a pun meaning both \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not Rubios\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not blonds\xe2\x80\x9d (or whites).'b'But if Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz are serious about their White House ambitions, they will need the votes of Latinos. That means they need to see to it that fairness dictates immigration reform. And that means the end of the Cuban Adjustment Act and \xe2\x80\x9cwet foot, dry foot.\xe2\x80\x9d So three Cuban-Americans \xe2\x80\x94 members of a group that enjoys an unprecedented, coveted status \xe2\x80\x94 could well decide the fate of millions of their less fortunate Hispanic brethren. Now that\xe2\x80\x99s rich. Only in America.'b'AS we were reminded last summer when thousands of unaccompanied children showed up on our southwestern border, the security and prosperity of Central America are inextricably linked with our own.'b'The economies of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras remain bogged down as the rest of the Americas surge forward. Inadequate education, institutional corruption, rampant crime and a lack of investment are holding these countries back. Six million young Central Americans are to enter the labor force in the next decade. If opportunity isn\xe2\x80\x99t there for them, the entire Western Hemisphere will feel the consequences.'b'Confronting these challenges requires nothing less than systemic change, which we in the United States have a direct interest in helping to bring about. Toward that end, on Monday, President Obama will request from Congress $1 billion to help Central America\xe2\x80\x99s leaders make the difficult reforms and investments required to address the region\xe2\x80\x99s interlocking security, governance and economic challenges. That is almost three times what we generally have provided to Central America.'b'Last summer, as our countries worked together to stem the dangerous surge in migration, the leaders of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras asked for additional assistance to change the climate of endemic violence and poverty that has held them back. In June, I made it clear to these leaders that the United States was ready to support them \xe2\x80\x94 provided they took ownership of the problem. Mr. Obama drove home this point when the leaders visited Washington in July.'b'And they responded. Honduras signed an agreement with Transparency International to combat corruption. Guatemala has removed senior officials suspected of corruption and aiding human trafficking. El Salvador passed a law providing new protections for investors. Working with the Inter-American Development Bank, these three countries forged a joint plan for economic and political reforms, an alliance for prosperity.'b'These leaders acknowledge that an enormous effort is required. We have agreed to intensify our work together in three areas.'b'First, security makes everything else possible. We can help stabilize neighborhoods through community-based policing, and eradicate transnational criminal networks that have turned Central America into a hotbed for drug smuggling, human trafficking and financial crime. Some communities in Guatemala and El Salvador are already seeing the benefit of United States-sponsored programs on community policing, specialized police training and youth centers similar to Boys and Girls Clubs in the United States. As I learned in crafting the 1994 United States crime bill, these programs can reduce crime.'b'Second, good governance begets the jobs and investment that Central America needs. Today, court systems, government contracting and tax collection are not widely perceived as transparent and fair. These countries have among the lowest effective tax rates in the hemisphere. To attract the investments required for real and lasting progress, they must collect and manage revenues effectively and transparently.'b'Third, there is not enough government money, even with assistance from the United States and the international community, to address the scale of the economic need. Central American economies can grow only by attracting international investment and making a more compelling case to their citizens to invest at home. That requires clear rules and regulations; protections for investors; courts that can be trusted to adjudicate disputes fairly; serious efforts to root out corruption; protections for intellectual property; and transparency to ensure that international assistance is spent accountably and effectively.'b'We are ready to work with international financial institutions and the private sector to help these countries train their young people, make it easier to start a business, and ensure that local enterprises get the most out of existing free trade agreements with the United States.'b'The challenges ahead are formidable. But if the political will exists, there is no reason Central America cannot become the next great success story of the Western Hemisphere.'b'The region has seen this sort of transformation before. In 1999, we initiated Plan Colombia to combat drug trafficking, grinding poverty and institutional corruption \xe2\x80\x94 combined with a vicious insurgency \xe2\x80\x94 that threatened to turn Colombia into a failed state. Fifteen years later, Colombia is a nation transformed. As one of the architects of Plan Colombia in the United States Senate, I saw that the key ingredient was political will on the ground. Colombia benefited from leaders who had the courage to make significant changes regarding security, governance and human rights. Elites agreed to pay higher taxes. The Colombian government cleaned up its courts, vetted its police force and reformed its rules of commerce to open up its economy. The United States invested $9 billion over the course of Plan Colombia, with $700 million the first year. But our figures show that Colombia outspent us four to one.'b'The cost of investing now in a secure and prosperous Central America is modest compared with the costs of letting violence and poverty fester.'b'Mr. Obama has asked me to lead this new effort. For the first time, we can envision and work toward having the Americas be overwhelmingly middle class, democratic and secure.'b'That is why we are asking Congress to work with us. Together, we can help Central America become an embodiment of the Western Hemisphere\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable rise \xe2\x80\x94 not an exception to it.'b'A couple of years after America\xe2\x80\x99s attempted invasion of Cuba in 1961, the disastrous intervention known as the Bay of Pigs, an envoy President John F. Kennedy secretly dispatched to Havana posed an odd question to the Cuban leader, Fidel Castro.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know how porcupines make love?\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'James Donovan asked'b', to make a point about how hard it would be to establish a trustful relationship between Washington and Havana. \xe2\x80\x9cVery carefully.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More than a half century later, as American and Cuban officials 'b'faced each other last week'b' for historic talks to begin normalizing relations, it was evident that trust remains in short supply. But this first step in the present d\xc3\xa9tente bodes well for a process that will require patience and deft managing of expectations in both countries.'b'Having been indoctrinated for decades to view the American government with suspicion and resentment, Cubans across the island were mesmerized by a week that was as remarkable for some of the things that happened as it was for those that did not.'b'A vivacious senior Cuban diplomat, 'b'Josefina Vidal'b', substantively answered questions about the thaw from international and Cuban journalists during a televised news conference, a rare sight in a country where official statements are typically oblique and issued in writing. Remarks to the press by 'b'Roberta Jacobson'b', the United States assistant secretary of state for Western Hemisphere affairs, were also televised and 'b'covered by Cuba\xe2\x80\x99s state media'b' without the usual condemnatory tone reserved for American policy.'b'The two women agreed to disagree on a lot, including what role Washington could play to promote greater freedoms in the authoritarian nation. But breaking with a tradition of charged rhetoric on both sides, Ms. Vidal and Ms. Jacobson treated each other civilly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDespite the profound differences between the two countries, the exchanges unfolded in a respectful and professional manner,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Vidal said.'b'Ms. Jacobson held a high-profile meeting with dissidents; the Cuban government did not stop it or publicly condemn it. She also visited the home of a prominent blogger, 'b'Yoani S\xc3\xa1nchez'b', where she gave an interview to the independent news site Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez runs from her living room. \xe2\x80\x9cAs journalists, we\xe2\x80\x99re witnessing historic days, in which information is a winner,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. S\xc3\xa1nchez tweeted.'b'Jos\xc3\xa9 Daniel Ferrer, a leading dissident, said he has reassessed his early concern that normalization of relations would embolden the Cuban government and hurt the cause of 'b'those who have been pressing for democratic reforms'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThe road is going to be very long and hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ferrer, the head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba, who met with Ms. Jacobson and other senior diplomats during her visit. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think that if we are able to work smartly and give it our best, we can advance a lot under these new parameters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Glued to the news, Cuban entrepreneurs were abuzz about the opportunities the new relationship could bring. Some Cuban journalists, meanwhile, suggested that it might be time for more media outlets to operate independent of state control.'b'What was arguably most striking about the momentous week in Havana was that neither of the Castro brothers was seen or heard from. But this week, Fidel Castro broke his silence about the new era with the United States, making a brief mention of the talks at the end of a lengthy letter published Monday by the Communist Party newspaper, Granma.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t trust American policies,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Castro wrote, adding that he nonetheless supported negotiations about the countries\xe2\x80\x99 differences through diplomacy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will always defend cooperation and friendship with all nations on earth, among them our political adversaries.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Ra\xc3\xbal Castro, meanwhile, said in a speech on Wednesday that the road to normalization will be long, as he listed a lengthy set of grievances, including the American naval base in Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay and the sanctions against the island.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe were able to advance in this recent negotiation because we treated each other with respect, as equals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'With plenty of people in both countries skeptical about the merits of a thaw, Cuban and American officials will need to be pragmatic and patient as they begin to untangle a toxic relationship laden with five decades of acrimony, resentment and mistrust. Given the enthusiasm and expectation the new era has sparked among ordinary Cubans and Americans alike, allowing the d\xc3\xa9tente to collapse would be a loss for both sides.'b'In seeking to dismantle the Affordable Care Act piece by piece, congressional Republicans have placed a high priority on 'b'repealing a tax on medical devices'b' that would raise some $29 billion over the next 10 years to help ensure that health reform will not increase the deficit. Repealing the tax is a terrible idea that has been given a veneer of respectability by support from liberal Democrats in states with large concentrations of device manufacturers. They include Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken of Minnesota and Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin, among others. President Obama ought to veto any bill that eliminates the tax.'b'The health reform law imposes a modest 2.3 percent tax on sales of medical devices, to be paid by the manufacturers or importers. It applies to such products as X-ray machines, M.R.I. scanners, pacemakers and artificial hip and knee joints but not to eyeglasses, contact lenses and hearing aids. The $29 billion to be raised from the device industry is less than the amounts to be raised from insurers and drug companies, all of which will benefit from increased business under the act and should pay their fair shares of the cost. If the lost revenues from a repeal of the device tax are offset by reduced spending on other health care programs, as they might well be, many patients could suffer medical or financial harm.'b'Trade groups say the tax has already caused a big loss of jobs, has reduced spending on research and will lead to a total loss of 195,000 jobs among manufacturers and suppliers and in the general economy over the next five years. They also say the tax will stifle innovation, drive up health care costs and provide an incentive for manufacturers to locate facilities overseas.'b'Independent analysts believe the industry\xe2\x80\x99s dire forecasts are malarkey. The Congressional Research Service estimated that the tax would have \xe2\x80\x9crelatively modest\xe2\x80\x9d effects on jobs, research and company profits and a \xe2\x80\x9cnegligible\xe2\x80\x9d effect on the price of health care. Some jobs would be lost, but they account for a tiny fraction of 1 percent of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s work force. The C.R.S. said the tax should not affect decisions on where to locate production facilities because domestically produced devices and imported devices are subject to the same tax.'b'Some parts of the industry are thriving.

On Wednesday, it 'b'announced'b' an agreement with plaintiffs in a lawsuit \xe2\x80\x9cthat restores the West Los Angeles V.A. campus to serving veterans in need,\xe2\x80\x9d by housing them there, and by ending the practice of leasing parts of the 387-acre property to outside parties in deals \xe2\x80\x9cthat do not meet the goal of serving veterans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Which raises two obvious questions: Isn\xe2\x80\x99t serving veterans the main \xe2\x80\x94 the only \xe2\x80\x94 purpose of the V.A.? Why did it have to be sued to do its job?'b'To which there is one obvious answer: Somewhere along the way, the department lost sight of its mission. The interests of wounded, destitute veterans came into conflict with those of people in Los Angeles who have power and money. The land went to corporate leaseholders, to other, apparently more urgent, commercial and civic needs \xe2\x80\x94 to baseball diamonds, theater stages, hotel laundries, rental car and bus storage, even oil wells and a dog park.'b'The homeless, meanwhile, went to sidewalks and highway underpasses.'b'This was the way it had been for many years. Los Angeles has long had the largest population of homeless veterans in the country, and also one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest V.A. medical centers. But nowhere on that property was there any permanent housing to help veterans leave the streets for good. That this deplorable situation was tolerated for so long reflects the failure of the area\xe2\x80\x99s elected officials. Its powerful congressional delegation and V.A. officials proclaimed their support for the veterans but never managed to do right by them.'b'Much credit goes to Secretary of Veterans Affairs Robert McDonald, barely six months on the job, for recognizing that the Los Angeles debacle could and should be remedied quickly. He listened to the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer Ron Olson and to Bobby Shriver, the former mayor of Santa Monica, who has pressed this issue for years, and embraced the once radical-sounding idea that the sickest and most troubled veterans need \xe2\x80\x9chousing first\xe2\x80\x9d to receive services they deserve but cannot get without a roof and a bed.'b'Credit Mr. McDonald, too, for agreeing to appoint a \xe2\x80\x9chomeless czar\xe2\x80\x9d to report directly to him, so this urgent mission does not get swallowed by the agency\xe2\x80\x99s dead-end bureaucracy. The ambitious agreement commits the V.A. to having, by mid-February, an \xe2\x80\x9caction plan\xe2\x80\x9d on ending homelessness in Los Angeles, and to completing, by October, a new master plan for the site.'b'Mr. McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor committed the V.A. to an ambitious plan to end veterans\xe2\x80\x99 homelessness by the end of this year.

Mr. McDonald has just given his department a swift kick in the right direction.'b'In the middle of 2013, the United States began supporting moderate rebels in Syria. We gave them just enough support to betray them.'b'As 'b'Adam Entous reported in The Wall Street Journal earlier this week'b', we promised the fighters support but then never had the will to follow through. The C.I.A. gave the rebels just 5 percent to 20 percent of the arms they requested. One trusted commander asked for more than a thousand rifles and received fewer than 36. One commander got the equivalent of 16 bullets a month per fighter. The rebels captured dozens of tanks, but the C.I.A. wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t provide cash for fuel or shells so the tanks just sat there.'b'The rebels asked the C.I.A. for ammunition to take advantage of temporary opportunities, but the C.I.A. sometimes took two weeks to decide. The U.S. gave the rebels money to pay their troops, but they only gave them $100 to $150 for each fighter per month. The Islamic State paid its fighters twice that.'b'The C.I.A. was terrified that the arms it supplied would fall into enemy hands so it maintained paralyzingly tight controls on sophisticated weaponry. Trusted commanders had to film their use of anti-tank missiles. They had to hand over spent missile launchers at a spot along the border to qualify for resupply.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe walk around Syria with a huge American flag planted on our backs, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t have enough AK-47s in our hands to protect ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d one fighter told American lawmakers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy did you give us hope if you were not going to do anything about it?\xe2\x80\x9d another asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe thought going with the Americans was going with the big guns,\xe2\x80\x9d another leader declared at a meeting. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a losing bet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The whole Wall Street Journal report gives the impression that the Islamic State not only has more resolve than the U.S. and its intelligence agencies, it has faster and more competent leadership.'b'The betrayal of the rebels in 2013 and 2014 is only a small betrayal, compared with the betrayal of values that might be unintentionally happening now. It appears as though the U.S. is backing off in its opposition to Bashar al-Assad, the mass murderer whose barbaric regime is a prime cause of instability in that part of the world. In our effort to stop the Islamic State, in the hopes of smoothing the Iranian nuclear talks, we may have entered a de facto alliance with Assad.'b'Now, Syria is obviously a viper\xe2\x80\x99s pit in a region where the choices normally range from the appalling to the horrendous. But there are ways to approach problems in this region, and there are ways not to.'b'The way not to approach the Middle East is as a chessboard on which the grandmasters of American foreign policy can impose their designs. This is the sort of overconfident thinking that leads policy makers to squander moral authority by vowing to destroy Assad one month and then effectively buttressing him the next. This is the sort of overconfident thinking that leads to too-clever calibration of our support for the moderate rebels \xe2\x80\x94 giving them enough support to give the illusion of doing something real, while not actually giving enough to do any good.'b'The Middle East is not a chessboard we have the power to manipulate. It is a generational drama in which we can only play our role. It is a drama over ideas, a contest between the forces of jihadism and the forces of pluralism.

We can only promote pluralism \xe2\x80\x94 steadily, consistently, simply.'b'Sticking to our values means maintaining a simple posture of support for people who share them and a simple posture of opposition to those who oppose them. It means offering at least some reliable financial support to moderate fighters and activists even when their prospects look dim. It means avoiding cynical alliances, at least as much as possible. It means using bombing campaigns to try to prevent mass slaughter.'b'If we do that then we will fortify people we don\xe2\x80\x99t know in ways we can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine. Over the long term, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make the Middle East slightly more fertile for moderation, which is the only influence we realistically have. Ideas drive history.'b'Right now there is bipartisan inconsistency over the effectiveness of government. Republicans think government is a bumbling tool at home but a magnificent instrument abroad. Democrats think government is a magnificent instrument at home but a bumbling tool abroad. In reality, government is best when it chooses the steady simple thing over the complex clever thing.

This is to tempt God.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a father of two children, I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine having seven. Growing up, nobody in our neighborhood had a big house. Kids were stuffed into tiny rooms, racked and stacked on bunk beds, crammed into a windowless space next to the boiler. My dad put in a little room in the basement next to where he brewed beer in 55-gallon plastic barrels. The non-Catholics, and even some of the Catholics from tonier parts of town, made fun of us \xe2\x80\x94 'b'don\xe2\x80\x99t those people know how to control themselves?'b''b'But beyond the strain to a house, adding another child, in our case, was a life and death matter.

As loyal Catholics, my parents practiced the \xe2\x80\x9crhythm method,\xe2\x80\x9d and you can see how well that worked out. Even an operation that was vital to the life of the mother was frowned upon, if that would make it impossible for her to get pregnant again. If she did what doctors insisted she do, she would be a bad Catholic. The bishop left my mother in tears. Hadn\xe2\x80\x99t she done her share?'b'She decided to ignore the admonition from on high.

For that matter, neither do politicians.'b'Today, some people with big families have taken offense at the pope\xe2\x80\x99s comments. Rick Santorum, a Catholic father of seven with a persistently medieval worldview, questioned what the pope was trying to accomplish.

Opposition to birth control and condoms in places like the Philippines poses serious public health risks, tempting God again.'b'The pope\xe2\x80\x99s rabbit remark did not bother me, as one of seven children, in the least. What bothers me is church dogma that disrespects people who are forced to go through what my mother went through.'b'Religions are at their best when they deal with the theological realm or big global issues.

But that fuzziness must now end. Recent events in Greece pose a fundamental challenge for Europe: Can it get past the myths and the moralizing, and deal with reality in a way that respects the Continent\xe2\x80\x99s core values? If not, the whole European project \xe2\x80\x94 the attempt to build peace and democracy through shared prosperity \xe2\x80\x94 will suffer a terrible, perhaps mortal blow.'b'First, about those myths: Many people seem to believe that the loans Athens has received since the crisis broke have been subsidizing Greek spending.'b'The truth, however, is that 'b'the great bulk of the money lent to Greece'b' has been used simply to pay interest and principal on debt. In fact, for the past two years, more than all of the money going to Greece has been recycled in this way: the Greek government is taking in more revenue than it spends on things other than interest, and handing the extra funds over to its creditors.'b'Or to oversimplify things a bit, you can think of European policy as involving a bailout, not of Greece, but of creditor-country banks, with the Greek government simply acting as the middleman \xe2\x80\x94 and with the Greek public, which has seen a catastrophic fall in living standards, required to make further sacrifices so that it, too, can contribute funds to that bailout.'b'One way to think about the demands of the newly elected Greek government is that it wants a reduction in the size of that contribution. Nobody is talking about Greece spending more than it takes in; all that might be on the table would be spending less on interest and more on things like health care and aid to the destitute. 'b'And doing so would have the side effect'b' of greatly reducing Greece\xe2\x80\x99s 25 percent rate of unemployment.'b'But doesn\xe2\x80\x99t Greece have an obligation to pay the debts its own government chose to run up? That\xe2\x80\x99s where the moralizing comes in.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that Greece (or more precisely the center-right government that ruled the nation from 2004-9) voluntarily borrowed vast sums. It\xe2\x80\x99s also true, however, that banks in Germany and elsewhere voluntarily lent Greece all that money. We would ordinarily expect both sides of that misjudgment to pay a price. But the private lenders have been largely bailed out ('b'despite a \xe2\x80\x9chaircut\xe2\x80\x9d on their claims in 2012'b'). Meanwhile, Greece is expected to keep on paying.'b'Now, the truth is that nobody believes that Greece can fully repay. So why not recognize that reality and reduce the payments to a level that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t impose endless suffering? Is the goal to make Greece an example for other borrowers? If so, how is that consistent with the values of what is supposed to be an association of sovereign, democratic nations?'b'The question of values becomes even starker once we consider why Greece\xe2\x80\x99s creditors still have power. If it were just a matter of government finance, Greece could simply declare bankruptcy; it would be cut off from new loans, but it would also stop paying off existing debts, and its cash flow would actually improve.'b'The problem for Greece, however, is the fragility of its banks, which currently (like banks throughout the euro area) have access to credit from the European Central Bank. Cut off that credit, and the Greek banking system would probably melt down amid huge bank runs. As long as it stays on the euro, then, Greece needs the good will of the central bank, which may, in turn, depend on the attitude of Germany and other creditor nations.'b'But think about how that plays into debt negotiations. Is Germany really prepared, in effect, to say to a fellow European democracy, \xe2\x80\x9cPay up or we\xe2\x80\x99ll destroy your banking system?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And think about what happens if the new Greek government \xe2\x80\x94 which was, after all, elected on a promise to end austerity \xe2\x80\x94 refuses to give in? That way, all too easily, lies a forced exit of Greece from the euro, with potentially disastrous economic and political consequences for Europe as a whole.'b'Objectively, resolving this situation shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard. Although nobody knows it, Greece has actually made great progress in regaining competitiveness; wages and costs have fallen dramatically, so that, at this point, austerity is the main thing holding the economy back. So what\xe2\x80\x99s needed is simple: Let Greece run smaller but still positive surpluses, which would relieve Greek suffering, and let the new government claim success, defusing the anti-democratic forces waiting in the wings. Meanwhile, the cost to creditor-nation taxpayers \xe2\x80\x94 who were never going to get the full value of the debt \xe2\x80\x94 would be minimal.'b'Doing the right thing would, however, require that other Europeans, Germans in particular, abandon self-serving myths and stop substituting moralizing for analysis.'b'Can they do it? We\xe2\x80\x99ll soon see.'b'PRESIDENT OBAMA\xe2\x80\x99s domestic agenda, which he announced in his State of the Union address this month, has a lot to like: health care, maternity leave, affordable college. But there was one thing he got wrong. As part of his promise to educate American children for an increasingly competitive world, he vowed to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect a free and open Internet\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cextend its reach to every classroom and every community.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More technology in the classroom has long been a policy-making panacea. But mounting evidence shows that showering students, especially those from struggling families, with networked devices will not shrink the class divide in education. If anything, it will widen it.'b'In the early 2000s, the Duke University economists Jacob Vigdor and Helen Ladd tracked the academic progress of nearly one million disadvantaged middle-school students against the dates they were given networked computers. The researchers assessed the students\xe2\x80\x99 math and reading skills annually for five years, and recorded how they spent their time. The news was not good.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStudents who gain access to a home computer between the 5th and 8th grades tend to witness a persistent decline in reading and math scores,\xe2\x80\x9d the economists 'b'wrote'b', adding that license to surf the Internet was also linked to lower grades in younger children.'b'In fact, the students\xe2\x80\x99 academic scores dropped and remained depressed for as long as the researchers kept tabs on them. What\xe2\x80\x99s worse, the weaker students (boys, African-Americans) were more adversely affected than the rest. When their computers arrived, their reading scores fell off a cliff.'b'We don\xe2\x80\x99t know why this is, but we can speculate. With no adults to supervise them, many kids used their networked devices not for schoolwork, but to play games, troll social media and download entertainment. (And why not? Given their druthers, most adults would do the same.)'b'The problem is the differential impact on children from poor families. Babies born to low-income parents spend at least 40 percent of their waking hours in front of a screen \xe2\x80\x94 more than twice the time spent by middle-class babies. They also get far less cuddling and bantering over family meals than do more privileged children. The give-and-take of these interactions is what predicts robust vocabularies and school success. Apps and videos don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'If children who spend more time with electronic devices are also more likely to be out of sync with their peers\xe2\x80\x99 behavior and learning by the fourth grade, why would adding more viewing and clicking to their school days be considered a good idea?'b'An unquestioned belief in the power of gadgetry has already led to educational snafus. Beginning in 2006, the nonprofit One Laptop Per Child project envisioned a digital utopia in which all students over 6 years old, worldwide, would own their own laptops. Impoverished children would thus have the power to go online and educate themselves \xe2\x80\x94 no school or teacher required. With laptops for poor children initially priced at $400, donations poured in.'b'But the program didn\xe2\x80\x99t live up to the ballyhoo. For one thing, the machines were buggy and often broke down. And when they did work, the impoverished students who received free laptops spent more time on games and chat rooms and less time on their homework than before, 'b'according to'b' the education researchers Mark Warschauer and Morgan Ames. It\xe2\x80\x99s drive-by education \xe2\x80\x94 adults distribute the laptops and then walk away.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that there is often an initial uptick in students\xe2\x80\x99 engagement with their studies \xe2\x80\x94 interactive apps can be fun. But the novelty wears off after a few months, said Larry Cuban, an emeritus education professor at Stanford.'b'Technology does have a role in education. But as Randy Yerrick, a professor of education at the University at Buffalo, told me, it is worth the investment only when it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly suited to the task, in science simulations, for example, or to teach students with learning disabilities.'b'And, of course, technology can work only when it is deployed as a tool by a terrific, highly trained teacher. As extensive research shows, just one year with a gifted teacher in middle school makes it far less likely that a student will get pregnant in high school, and much more likely that she will go to college, earn a decent salary, live in a good neighborhood and save for retirement. To the extent that such a teacher can benefit from classroom technology, he or she should get it. But only when such teachers are effectively trained to apply a specific application to teaching a particular topic to a particular set of students \xe2\x80\x94 only then does classroom technology really work.'b'Even then, we still have no proof that the newly acquired, tech-centric skills that students learn in the classroom transfer to novel problems that they need to solve in other areas. While we\xe2\x80\x99re waiting to find out, the public money spent on wiring up classrooms should be matched by training and mentorship programs for teachers, so that a free and open Internet, reached through constantly evolving, beautifully packaged and compelling electronic tools, helps \xe2\x80\x94 not hampers \xe2\x80\x94 the progress of children who need help the most.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Charles M.

'b''b'In the past few weeks, as the radical leftist party Syriza barreled toward victory in 'b'Greece'b'\xe2\x80\x99s early national elections, it became a symbol both inside and outside the country: Everyone seemed to see what they wanted in the formerly marginal party that promised to reject the international bailout agreement that has kept Greece on life support for nearly five years.'b'For a growing number of Greeks, exhausted and desperate after six years of recession and insecurity, Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s anti-austerity platform was seen as a promise of salvation and an effort to reclaim the country\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty; others saw the impending clash with Greece\xe2\x80\x99s European Union partners as a deadly threat to an economy that was just beginning to show signs of growth.'b'Many foreign observers, on the left and the right, saw Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a rebellion against austerity and the economic and political orthodoxy of the European Union, a revolt that could spread to other debtor nations. European Union governments, which had lent Greece money (along with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund), worried that their taxpayers would foot the bill for Greece\xe2\x80\x99s voters and that this would inspire populist revolts in other countries.'b'In the first days after the Jan. 25 election, Syriza remains a chimera, an unpredictable hybrid. The party is a coalition of several factions and viewpoints, with cabinet members ranging from garrulous, cosmopolitan academics to former Communist trade-unionists with limited experience of the outside world. Adding to the puzzle is the fact that the party leader, Alexis Tsipras, the new prime minister, formed a coalition with a small, extreme right-wing party \xe2\x80\x94 Independent Greeks \xe2\x80\x94 in order to hold a majority in the 300-member Parliament. This decision puzzled local supporters as well as foreign analysts. The two parties have in common their virulent opposition to the bailout agreement, and this was one more way for Mr. Tsipras to show that his pre-election rhetoric was no bluff.'b'The government is clearly heading for a clash with Greece\xe2\x80\x99s partners. It is pushing for a large reduction of debt and the annulment of various structural reforms carried out (halfheartedly) by previous governments. In their first comments, new ministers have announced cuts in the privatization program and the recall of public sector employees who were laid off \xe2\x80\x94 canceling measures demanded by creditors. Several European leaders have reminded Athens that Greece is committed to the bailout agreement and that Europe cannot write off loans their taxpayers provided. Greece\xe2\x80\x99s financing expires in February, unless bailout monitors from the troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) complete an inspection suspended in November.'b'Syriza declares that it does not recognize the troika and will deal only with European decision-making bodies. Mr. Tsipras stresses that he wants Greece to remain in the eurozone. But with Greece shut out of capital markets, and with its partners not about to give in to Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s demands, it is difficult to see how the economy will function if funds run out.'b'The showdown over the bailout is extremely dangerous, and obscures many serious issues that need to be dealt with in Greece and in the European Union as a whole.'b'Greece is the first European Union country in which a party from the political fringes has ridden a wave of popular anger against economic hardship to provide a direct challenge to policy makers in European capitals. The program of loans in return for austerity and reform has not gone according to plan and needs fixing. In turn, Greece must make a huge effort to create a  viable economy that will not need further bailouts.'b'Syriza, not being part of the political mainstream that governed Greece over the past four decades, is in a unique position to cut down on the corruption, tax evasion and inequality that plague Greece. But at the same time, the party also shares a dominant mind-set that holds back progress, such as devotion to a huge state and an economy and education system in which politics play a destructive role. Syriza represents the potential for change as well as the danger of rolling back reforms of the past few years.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d with the Independent Greeks, whose 13 Parliament members are now added to Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s 149, reveals another aspect of Greece\xe2\x80\x99s politics. The smaller party represents the opposite of Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s liberal social platform, which includes expanded rights for immigrants, recognition of 'b'same-sex marriage'b', separation of church and state, and protection of  human rights.'b'Apart from their rejection of the bailout agreement \xe2\x80\x94 the Independent Greeks\xe2\x80\x99 leader, Panos Kammenos, is even more vocal than Mr. Tsipras in his attacks on Germany \xe2\x80\x94 the two party leaders have something else in common: Mr. Tsipras, who is 40, and Mr. Kammenos, who is 49, both cut their political teeth during years that Greece experienced unprecedented growth, stability and prosperity.'b'As a student activist for the Communist Party, Mr. Tsipras learned that the way to get things done was by confronting authority while making maximal demands; Mr. Kammenos, the son of a wealthy businessman, entered the cocoon of mainstream politics early and was deeply embedded in the establishment, serving in a previous conservative government before forming his own party. So Syriza has chosen a coalition partner that will not temper the government\xe2\x80\x99s stand against its European Union partners but will probably try to outdo the leftists on rhetoric and actions.'b'The confrontation with Greece\xe2\x80\x99s creditors can be seen as a clash between populism and dogma: on one side, a government that gained power by exploiting anger and despair; on the other, the creditor countries and organizations that insist on austerity even in the face of evidence that it is destroying a country and its people.'b'But it also raises the issue of democracy, and how the rights of one nation can clash with the rights of others. If the democratically elected Greek government reneges on the country\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to repay its debt, this will be at the expense of taxpayers in partner countries. If the European Union pushes Greece hard for further austerity to get back the loans, this may crush the will of Greek voters. And if the European Union leaves Greece in its proud isolation, where its economy will most likely collapse, will all Greeks be forced to pay for the mistakes of a government elected by 36 percent of them (along with the less than 5 percent who voted for its partner)?'b'Political developments in Greece now demand a serious discussion on the relationship among Europe\xe2\x80\x99s peoples, and on the need for reform to spring from hope, not punishment.'b''b'\n'b'Nikos Konstandaras 'b'is the managing editor and a columnist at the newspaper Kathimerini. 'b''b'ABOARD THE POLAR PIONEER, off the Antarctic Peninsula \xe2\x80\x94 I never intended to go to Antarctica and I intended never to read \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick.\xe2\x80\x9d There is a significant distinction between these two positions. It had simply not crossed my mind that Antarctica could be a tourist destination, until I was offered a writing commission to go there. But \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d was a book that was always waiting to be read, and it was an active assertion of will to decide no, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. I made that decision after someone I don\xe2\x80\x99t now remember described it as an interminable novel with tortured descriptions of harpoons and ropes and men with crazy obsessions. I can\xe2\x80\x99t fully explain the doggedness of that position, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t extend to any other so-called great book, but I became even more intractable about it after my friends Karin and Elizabeth, the two people whose literary tastes I most trust, also pressed me to read the book.'b'But when a week before I set off, another friend suggested \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d should accompany me on the 10-day voyage from Ushuaia, Argentina, to as-far-as-the-ice-would-allow-it along the Antarctic Peninsula and back to Puerto Williams, Chile, it immediately felt inevitable. I would read the book I had planned never to read in the place where I had never planned to go. There\xe2\x80\x99s no arguing with the universe when it throws symmetry your way.'b'I started to read it two days into the voyage, when our ship, the Polar Pioneer, a Russian icebreaker carrying 52 tourists, had crossed the choppy Drake Passage and was nearing the South Shetland Islands. I opened to the first page of the book and wrote in its bottom margin, \xe2\x80\x9cDec 8: Sailing to Antarctica on the Polar Pioneer. First whale (humpback) sighted at 2.20 p.m.\xe2\x80\x9d I never annotate novels; it seems odd to think anything I might write in the margins could add to rather than detract from what is printed on the page. But from the start, the echoes between what I was reading and what I was seeing around me seemed to ask for me to take note, quite literally.'b'And so very quickly (in fact, by page 20, as my annotations tell me) my favorite reading spot became a high chair on the bridge, where I could look up from the \xe2\x80\x9cice and icebergs all astern\xe2\x80\x9d on the page to see the very sight before me. \xe2\x80\x9cThrough icy water \xe2\x80\x94 we feel the ship scrape against small icebergs,\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote as the Polar Pioneer progressed through the Lemaire Channel with snow-covered cliffs on both sides and snow petrels swooping about. At the top of the next page I read Melville\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbrace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas\xe2\x80\x9d and at the bottom is my handwriting again: \xe2\x80\x9cAlmost constant shuddering through the ship now that it is impossible to skirt the icebergs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sometimes the annotations were marks of difference rather than similarity between the Pequod of \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d and the Polar Pioneer of my voyage. \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme lord and dictator\xe2\x80\x9d is how Melville describes Captain Ahab. Beside that sentence I wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd here I sit, on the bridge, behind Captain Yuri of very tolerant countenance.\xe2\x80\x9d I should say that \xe2\x80\x9cvery tolerant countenance\xe2\x80\x9d is not in my everyday speech. But by this point the book was working its way into me \xe2\x80\x94 as was the surrounding landscape. As I read on and traveled on, the superficial annotations marking echoes and variations became increasingly sparse: In iceberg country, the bulk of experience lies beneath the surface.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d and Antarctica have this in common: At the very start you stand amazed, believing you\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced \xe2\x80\x9cthe great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is only when you are further in that you look back upon that beginning (of book, of voyage along the continent) and are startled by how ordinary it seems compared with where you now are. The day I started to read the book was also our first landing via inflatable Zodiac crafts, in which we skimmed along the calm water toward the Aitcho Islands of the South Shetlands and visited our first penguin colony. How feverishly we all reached for our cameras and took pictures of the first, lone penguin that walked past our party; how we gasped in amazement at the first Weddell seal moving across the snow like a slug.'b'We knew nothing then of what was yet to come: the sculpture parks of icebergs; the elephant seal pups that would lie on our legs and consent to being stroked; the hissing, jabbing, pecking battles between skuas and penguins for penguin eggs on the verge of hatching; the sailing into the caldera of an active volcano; the whale pods swimming alongside the ship, raising their flukes above the surface ever so often \xe2\x80\x94 a sight that Melville described as \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature.\xe2\x80\x9d All these sights were still unimagined when, back on the bridge after Aitcho Island, I was reading the encounter of Ishmael with Queequeg the Cannibal, not recognizing that as wonderful as it was, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t possibly prepare me for the complete break with all convention, all recognized form, that Melville would embark on once he had his readers on the Pequod.'b'Why do people persist in claiming that \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d is about Ahab\xe2\x80\x99s obsession with the white whale? Certainly it is a book about obsession, but it is Melville who is obsessed, with the need to capture the visible in a net of words. What else explains all those chapters about kinds of whales, parts of whales, stages of reducing a dead whale to salable components, not to mention the details of every last rivet on a whaling ship? Or, as Andrew Delbanco more elegantly puts it in his introduction to the Penguin Classics edition, \xe2\x80\x9cit furnishes one dazzling solution after another to the persistent literary problem of conveying to an innocent reader the palpable reality of an unfamiliar world.\xe2\x80\x9d Until Antarctica, I had never stepped foot anywhere that struck me so forcefully as an \xe2\x80\x9cunfamiliar world\xe2\x80\x9d in a purely physical sense. From Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio de Janeiro to the Buddhist stupas of Taxila, everything I have ever seen has been an amplified version of something I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen or read about before.'b'Antarctica is a different matter. \xe2\x80\x9cHow will you ever describe this to people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t been here?\xe2\x80\x9d the other tourists asked me, over and over. The line announced itself as a challenge the first time I heard it, and everywhere I went I tried to translate the images around me into descriptive sentences, particularly the icebergs, so varied in shape and texture and even color (those blues!). It felt from the start that I would fail; the camera on my smartphone would convey more than I ever could.'b'But as I burrowed more deeply into Melville, I knew my failure had nothing to do with the power of word versus photograph and everything to do with the power of Melville\xe2\x80\x99s sentences versus mine. One Antarctic afternoon, near the British base of Port Lockroy, I trudged knee-deep in snow toward what appeared to be sun-bleached oars someone had jammed vertically into the packed whiteness. They were whale vertebrae, from a partially buried skeleton. A few of us dug around to reveal more of them, part of the skull and a lower jaw. The size muddled our comprehension: We spent a long time identifying the bone that was the mandible, even though its position near the unmistakable skull should have made it obvious. How could a jawbone be that size?'b'When I took off my wet gloves, my hands were warm with sun and exertion. I snapped some photographs. Considered if I could come up with anything better than \xe2\x80\x9csun-bleached oars\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the vertebrae; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t. Tried to construct an image of a whale from the bones against which I rested my fingertips; couldn\xe2\x80\x99t again. A few days later I read the chapter \xe2\x80\x9cMeasurement of the Whale\xe2\x80\x99s Skeleton.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cHow vain and foolish ... for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton. ... Only in the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out.\xe2\x80\x9d The rhythm of the language, its use of rhyme and assonance, the miracle of compression within that expansive sentence! You journey into Melville as though he were a new continent, unlike any you\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered before.'b'Of course, I was wrong to think Melville\xe2\x80\x99s sole obsession was with capturing the visible. It was my own preoccupation with the \xe2\x80\x9chow would you describe this?\xe2\x80\x9d question that I was reading into his work, which goes so far beyond the visible world. By the end of the voyage I realized that describing icebergs couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really begin to convey how it felt that day, our last before we sailed away from the Antarctic Peninsula, when we spent hours on Zodiacs, warming our hands against the sun-soaked flanks of the crafts gliding along a sea so still that every iceberg was almost indistinguishable from its reflection. The next day I jotted down one of my last annotations, just over halfway through the novel: \xe2\x80\x9cFinal landing, on Elephant Island. Returning to the ship I noticed only one iceberg to be seen. We have sailed away from them; the sea has lost much of its magic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Because then the annotations almost entirely disappear, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many pages of \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d I had left when we disembarked the Polar Pioneer at Puerto Williams. A little over 50 is probably about right. I switched on my phone, which had served the sole function of camera for the last 10 days, and the first text message I saw, sent more than 24 hours earlier, was from a BBC producer asking me if I might come on a news show to talk about \xe2\x80\x9cthe tragedy in Peshawar.\xe2\x80\x9d It fell to my sister, who still lives in Pakistan, where we both grew up, to explain what that meant: the massacre of schoolchildren by the Taliban. When I next picked up \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick,\xe2\x80\x9d that evening, all I could see in it was Ahab, the fanatic, infecting his crew with his vengeful, suicidal madness. In what world of enchantment had I been sailing that allowed me to read \xe2\x80\x9cMoby-Dick\xe2\x80\x9d without seeing a reflection of the blood-soaked world in which we live?'b'The West African 'b'Ebola'b' outbreak first hit Sierra Leone in May 2014, followed by an explosion of cases in the capital Freetown in the autumn. The epidemic now counts more than 10,500 cases across Sierra Leone, with signs that the spread is slowing.'b'The early days of the crisis were characterized by a sense of immense fear, anxiety and alarm, regionally and globally. In Sierra Leone, a three-day, countrywide, military-led lockdown in September fed the fear in West Africa and beyond. Many flights originating in unaffected African countries were restricted. African students were prevented from attending some American schools, and there were countless reports of discrimination against Africans across the globe. Pictures of health workers in full protective suits became a ubiquitous symbol of the panic.'b'Misleading reports, speculation and poor projections from international agencies, government ministries and the media about the Ebola outbreak exacerbated the problem. The fear that was spread by the dramatic reports that accentuated the negative, undermined confidence, made it harder to encourage people to seek care, and misdirected attention away from Sierra Leone\xe2\x80\x99s urban areas, where data suggest the economic effects of Ebola have been concentrated.'b'Valid, credible and timely data is essential during a global crisis. Without reliable data, efforts to assist affected people and to rebuild damaged communities can be misdirected and inefficient.'b'An early example of how data were presented misleadingly was the 'b'World Health Organization'b'\xe2\x80\x99s choice to report from April through August that the death rate from Ebola was \xe2\x80\x9cup to 90 percent,\xe2\x80\x9d when the actual death rate of this outbreak from confirmed cases, even in the early days in March 2014 in Guinea, was about 70 percent \xe2\x80\x94 still hardly reassuring, but better than almost-certain death. Warning people of likely death is not a good way to encourage them to seek care.'b'Both the W.H.O. and the 'b'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'b' misjudged how the disease would evolve. Initially slow to appreciate the severity of the outbreak, the W.H.O. and the C.D.C. subsequently overestimated likely cases. The C.D.C. projected that up to 1.4 million people in Liberia and Sierra Leone could be infected by January 2015. (As of Jan. 27, 19,140 cases have been reported across the two countries.)'b'Inaccurate and implausible claims about the economic impact further reduced the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence, which had its own economic consequences.'b'For example, in August, a senior Sierra Leonean government official was reported as saying his country\xe2\x80\x99s Gross Domestic Product had fallen by 30 percent, a figure that was implausible considering the crisis was only a few months old and that even during Sierra Leone\xe2\x80\x99s devastating civil war real G.D.P. fell only by an average of 5 percent a year.'b'In October, the World Bank estimated that the costs associated with Ebola for West Africa as a whole may be as high as $32.6 billion, an estimate that was revised down this month to be at most $6 billion. When the public anticipates bad times, they cut back on discretionary purchases and save more, compounding the effects of the shock.'b'Meanwhile, the local and international press was full of reports of skyrocketing 'b'food prices'b', while surveys undertaken by the International Growth Center and Innovations for Poverty Action of markets across Sierra Leone (conducted monthly from August through December 2014) showed food prices in line with previous years.'b'One problem with doomsday scenarios is that when reliable data is finally released \xe2\x80\x94 as they were this month \xe2\x80\x94 the real figures can seem small and insignificant relative to earlier predictions.'b'They are not. In Sierra Leone, the urban areas in particular have been badly hit. The percentage of household heads \xe2\x80\x9cnot working in the previous week\xe2\x80\x9d rose from 25 percent in July/August to 33 percent in November. This reduction in employment is taking place in one of the poorest countries in the world with few formal safety nets. Just over a quarter of household heads work in non-farm household enterprises in which revenues are down by 40 percent over this period, and the six-month failure rate of these businesses tripled.'b'The informal economy is particularly vulnerable to the fear that is stoked by bad data. When the future is uncertain people cut back on small luxuries like purchasing snacks on the street or having their hair done, yet these discretionary purchases are the mainstay of the non-farm enterprise sector. This sector has also been hit badly by government restrictions on transportation, markets, bars and restaurants.'b'Why were projections so bad? Partly because it is hard to collect good data in a crisis. But also, we believe, because dramatic headlines make for a better story. Agencies face asymmetric incentives: They are likely to face more criticism for underestimating rather than overestimating the impact of an emergency. As they scramble to raise funding for a crisis in a world grown weary of alarm calls, the temptation is to focus on the upper range of plausible estimates.'b'But collectively focusing on worst-case scenarios can make people fatalistic, damaging efforts to prevent the disease from spreading. It also has a negative effect on the economy and makes it harder for those seeking to raise money for future crises. Independent data sources and assessments are vital to our understanding of and response to the crisis.'b'There is real suffering in Sierra Leone today and a lot the international community can do, but we need to be clear- sighted and levelheaded about the problems if we are to help effectively.'b'A drone crashed 'b'into the White House lawn'b' early Monday.'b'A secretive group met behind closed doors in New York this week.

And we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking just about music downloads and pirated DVDs. These rules could help big pharmaceutical companies maintain or increase their monopoly profits on brand-name drugs.'b'The secrecy of the T.P.P. negotiations makes them maddeningly opaque and hard to discuss. But we can get a pretty good idea of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening, based on documents obtained by WikiLeaks from past meetings (they began in 2010), what we know of American influence in other trade agreements, and what others and myself have gleaned from talking to negotiators.'b'Trade agreements are negotiated by the office of the United States Trade Representative, supposedly on behalf of the American people. Historically, though, the trade representative\xe2\x80\x99s office has aligned itself with corporate interests. If big pharmaceutical companies hold sway \xe2\x80\x94 as the leaked documents indicate they do \xe2\x80\x94 the T.P.P. could block cheaper generic drugs from the market. Big Pharma\xe2\x80\x99s profits would rise, at the expense of the health of patients and the budgets of consumers and governments.'b'There are two ways the office of the trade representative can use the T.P.P. to maintain or raise drug prices and profits.'b'The first is to restrict competition from generics. It\xe2\x80\x99s axiomatic that more competition means lower prices. When companies have to fight for customers, they end up cutting their prices. When a patent expires, any company can enter the market with a generic version of a drug. The differences in prices between brand-name and generic drugs are mind- and budget-blowing. Just the availability of generics drives prices down: In generics-friendly India, for example, Gilead Sciences, which makes an effective hepatitis-C drug, recently announced that it would sell the drug for a little more than 1 percent of the $84,000 it charges here.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why, since the United States opened up its domestic market to  generics in 1984, they have grown from 19 percent of prescriptions to 86 percent, by some accounts saving the United States government, consumers and employers more than $100 billion a year. Drug companies stand to gain handsomely if the T.P.P. limits the sale of generics.'b'The second strategy is to undermine government regulation of drug prices. More competition is not the only way to keep down the prices of essential goods and services. Governments can also directly restrain prices through law, or effectively restrain them by denying reimbursement to patients for \xe2\x80\x9coverpriced\xe2\x80\x9d drugs \xe2\x80\x94 thus encouraging companies to bring down their prices to approved levels. These regulatory approaches are especially important in markets where competition is limited, as it is in the drug market. If the United States Trade Representative gets its way, the T.P.P. will limit the ability of partner countries to restrict prices. And the pharmaceutical companies surely hope the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d they help set in this agreement will become global \xe2\x80\x94 for example, by becoming the starting point for United States negotiations with the European Union over the same issues.'b'Americans might shrug at the prospect of soaring drug prices around the world. After all, the United States already allows drug companies to charge what they want. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we might not want to change things someday. Here again, the T.P.P. has us cornered: Trade agreements, and in particular individual provisions within them, are typically far more difficult to alter or repeal than  domestic laws.'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t be sure which of these features have made it through this week\xe2\x80\x99s negotiations. What\xe2\x80\x99s clear is that the overall thrust of the intellectual property section of the T.P.P. is for less competition and higher drug prices. The effects will go beyond the 12 T.P.P. countries. Barriers to generics in the Pacific will put pressure on producers of such drugs in other countries, like  India, as well.'b'Of course, pharmaceutical companies claim they need to charge high prices to fund their research and development. This just isn\xe2\x80\x99t so. For one thing, drug companies spend more on marketing and advertising than on new ideas. Overly restrictive intellectual property rights actually slow new discoveries, by making it more difficult for scientists to build on the research of others and by choking off the exchange of ideas that is critical to innovation. As it is, most of the important innovations come out of our universities and research centers, like the National Institutes of Health, funded by government and foundations.'b'The efforts to raise drug prices in the T.P.P. take us in the wrong direction. The whole world may come to pay a price in the form of worse health and unnecessary deaths.'b''b'\n'b'Joseph E. Stiglitz, 'b' a Nobel laureate in economics, a professor at Columbia and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Price of Inequality.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b'Now that Sheldon Silver has been pressured into agreeing to resign as speaker of New York\xe2\x80\x99s Assembly after his arrest on corruption charges, the governor and the lawmakers who so poorly represent the state should not kid themselves into thinking they have made real progress on cleaning up what the federal prosecutor who indicted Mr. Silver called the \xe2\x80\x9ccaldron of corruption\xe2\x80\x9d in Albany.'b'In theory, the Democrats who control the Assembly should be able to pick a successor who is committed to good governance and ethics reform, but already the signs of back-room dealing and meddling from party hacks are not encouraging. And even a good choice would not be enough. Without real change, New York\xe2\x80\x99s lawmakers could simply continue to rob the public of more than money, as the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, Preet Bharara, said recently. These lawmakers cheat New Yorkers of the honest and productive representation they need and deserve.'b'If this is not the moment for change, then when?'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo needs to lead the way, to turn his abstract promises of reform into tough laws that make a difference. Legislators who stand in his way can no longer hide behind the well-worn tricks used by the likes of Mr. Silver and other leaders in Albany to avoid accountability and real change.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s at issue is the present and future governance of a state with nearly 20 million people and a budget of $150 billion, which is larger than that of many nations, including Finland, Venezuela and Egypt. The state\xe2\x80\x99s 214 lawmakers not only influence the way people live across the state, but they have a chokehold on taxes, development, traffic and even education in New York City.'b'Over the last decade, more than 'b'30 state officials'b' have gone to prison or been accused of sexual or civic wrongdoing ranging from bribery to stealing state money and extortion. The group of 30 includes several lawmakers accused of sexual harassment. One governor resigned in scandal, a comptroller \xe2\x80\x94 the watchdog of the public purse \xe2\x80\x94 was jailed for fraud.'b'Of Albany\xe2\x80\x99s many ethical problems, here are the three most urgent. In each case, we offer an ideal, long-term solution and a short-term \xe2\x80\x9cuntil then\xe2\x80\x9d fix.'b''b'Outside Income'b''b'Mr. Silver is accused of using his law practice to rake in millions of dollars while helping clients in Albany. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine lawmakers voluntarily giving up all outside income, except, say, lecture fees, although that would be the ideal outcome. Governor Cuomo has proposed a commission that would 'b'recommend'b' a two-tiered salary scale \xe2\x80\x94 one for full-time legislators and another for those with outside income. This could take forever. Short term, the Legislature should consider a bill offered by State Senator Brad Hoylman, a Manhattan Democrat, that would cap outside income at 15 percent of official salary, much as Congress does. Income should be documented in detail, including the amounts and the names of clients for legislators who are lawyers.'b''b'Campaign Finance'b''b'The charges against Mr. Silver make it scandalously clear how easy it is to buy influence in Albany. The campaign finance system needs a complete overhaul, with lowered limits, more disclosure and public matching funds for campaigns. Until then, lawmakers could end the scam used by many contributors to get around the few limits New York State law does have; they create dozens of small limited-liability corporations that can each give the maximum amount allowed. That was the method prosecutors say was used by Leonard Litwin, the real estate developer, whose company, Glenwood Management, funneled more than $10 million to candidates and party committees, including substantial funds to Mr. Silver.'b''b'Oversight'b''b'The ethics police in Albany have been rendered powerless by the lawmakers who created them. The Joint Commission on Public Ethics is unwieldy and unable to proceed with an investigation if the members appointed by the Legislature veto it. Another group, the Legislative Ethics Commission, does little more than dispense advice. The New York Public Interest Research Group last week 'b'proposed a merger'b' of the two, and urged greater independence. Until then, New Yorkers will have to rely on outsiders like Mr. Bharara for ethics policing.'b'In his State of the State 'b'speech'b' last week, Governor Cuomo spent only 80 seconds on the need to \xe2\x80\x9crestore the public\xe2\x80\x99s trust.\xe2\x80\x9d He mentioned, in passing, the public financing of campaigns and the issue of outside income.

These moves will hurt the Chinese economy and create a major rift between China and the rest of the world.'b'The government of President Xi Jinping has taken a series of steps recently that have unnerved businesses, human rights organizations and governments around the world. This week, for example, American and other foreign business groups 'b'sent a letter'b' to Mr. Xi protesting new policies that require companies that sell computer equipment to Chinese banks to turn over their source code to the government and to create ways for security officials to monitor and control those devices. Industry executives expect similar policies to be enacted for other sectors of the Chinese economy, making it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, for foreign technology vendors to sell their products to Chinese customers.'b'Chinese officials have also proposed a 'b'law'b', purportedly to fight terrorism, that would require technology companies to provide the government with the means to monitor all communications over their systems in China, including those that are encrypted. And in recent weeks, the authorities have made it nearly impossible for Internet users to employ 'b'virtual private networks'b' that allow people to evade the government filters and restrictions collectively known as the Great Firewall. Dissidents, researchers, businesses and professionals have long used V.P.N.s to access information beyond China\xe2\x80\x99s borders, and the government previously seemed to tolerate the practice.'b'With these new moves, Chinese leaders are trying to increase government control over communications in order to suppress dissent. And they are trying to promote Chinese technology businesses at the expense of foreign companies. That is not entirely surprising. Mr. Xi has previously made clear that he considers the free flow of information on the Internet a 'b'threat'b' to the Communist Party. And he'b' has said 'b'that he considers domestic control over technology a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cnational economic security, defense security and other aspects of security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But this push for greater control could cost China dearly. The country\xe2\x80\x99s businesses and professionals say it has become increasingly difficult for them to communicate with customers and suppliers abroad or to obtain scientific data and research from the rest of the world. Executives at Chinese banks are reportedly worried that they will have to rely on substandard domestic computer equipment that could make their systems more vulnerable to hacking by criminals, foreign rivals and others.'b'Foreign businesses and governments are rightly saying these new policies amount to protectionism. The changes also seem to make a joke of China\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to abide by global trading rules established by the World Trade Organization and of its stated desire to deepen trade and investment ties with the United States and other countries. Officials from China and the United States are negotiating a 'b'bilateral investment treaty'b' that is supposed to make it easier for companies from each country to do business in the other nation. American officials should use those talks to put China on notice that its latest security policies are wrongheaded and unacceptable.'b'Mr. Xi cannot expect the United States or any other country to engage in negotiations to liberalize trade and investment with his country while his government is actively making it impossible for foreign businesses to survive there.'b'New York City\xe2\x80\x99s correction commissioner did the right thing this month when he 'b'fired a captain and five guards'b' who tied up and savagely beat an inmate at the Rikers Island jail complex in the spring of 2012. But the fact that it took nearly three years to dismiss the officers reveals \xe2\x80\x94 again \xe2\x80\x94 a disciplinary process badly in need of repair. It also underscores the need for the full-scale reforms that the Justice Department is seeking in federal court.'b'The case dates to April 2012, when the guards and the captain hogtied a mentally ill man named Robert Hinton and carried him by his arms and legs into a solitary confinement cell. He emerged with a fractured vertebra and a broken nose, his eyes swollen shut and blood streaming from his mouth. If ever there was a case that demanded swift resolution, this was it. But the department\xe2\x80\x99s internal investigations often move slowly, thanks to the immense power of the correction officers\xe2\x80\x99 union, which essentially runs the jail system.'b'The process is so drawn out that officers awaiting disciplinary action in one case can be implicated in another. Eight months after the Hinton case, the captain who has now been fired is said to have joined other officers in handcuffing two inmates to a gurney, wheeling them into an examination room beyond the view of security cameras and beating them savagely while horrified members of the medical staff pleaded with them to stop.'b'In the past, officers charged with brutality typically received suspensions, then returned to work. But in an unusual ruling last fall, an administrative law judge said that the miscarriage of justice in the 2012 case was so egregious that the six men involved should be fired. Unlike previous commissioners who sometimes dragged their feet, the current commissioner, Joseph Ponte, accepted that recommendation. Even so, the officers are free to appeal to the Civil Service Commission.'b'Mr. Ponte\xe2\x80\x99s prompt action is no doubt related to a 'b'pending federal class-action lawsuit'b', joined by the Justice Department last month, that charges the Correction Department with failing to discipline officers engaged in abuse. Any settlement of that suit must require the city to strengthen and streamline a clearly inadequate disciplinary system.'b''b''b"Editors' Note:"b''b''b''b'Joe Nocera\xe2\x80\x99s column on Saturday, about the arrest of the longtime New York State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, was premised on several factual errors.'b''b''b'The column misidentified the person who in 2008 placed Arthur Luxenberg, a lawyer who represents people exposed to asbestos, on a panel that recommends judicial appointments.

In fact, the panel had no involvement in that appointment.'b''b''b'Finally, the column implied that Mr. Silver rewarded the judiciary with a pay increase. While Mr. Silver\xe2\x80\x99s appointee to a state commission on judicial pay did cast a deciding vote in 2011 for a pay raise, as the column noted, the appointee actually voted against an even greater pay increase favored by some members of the commission.'b''b''b'_____________'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe scandal isn\xe2\x80\x99t what\xe2\x80\x99s illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d goes one of Michael Kinsley\xe2\x80\x99s best-known sayings. \xe2\x80\x9cThe scandal is what\xe2\x80\x99s legal.\xe2\x80\x9d I offer you l\xe2\x80\x99affaire Sheldon Silver as a case in point.'b'Silver, who for two decades was the all-powerful speaker of the New York Assembly, was indicted last Thursday for 'b'a variety of alleged illegal actions'b'. Chief among them was his failure to list outside income on his financial disclosure forms, and his steering $500,000 from a state slush fund he controlled to a doctor who specialized in mesothelioma \xe2\x80\x94 a rare, deadly cancer \xe2\x80\x94 in return for client referrals. Silver says he\xe2\x80\x99ll be vindicated, but Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney who indicted him, has won the cooperation of a number of key participants, including said doctor, whose name is 'b'Robert Taub'b'. We\xe2\x80\x99ll return to him in a minute.'b'Despite the rather obvious potential for conflict of interest, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly legal for a New York legislator to earn outside income. Few took fuller advantage of this than Silver, who for more than a decade was paid millions of dollars by two law firms. One of them was Weitz &amp; Luxenberg, a big-time New York plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 firm that specializes in bringing lawsuits on behalf of people with mesothelioma, which results primarily from exposure to asbestos.'b'Though Silver is a lawyer, he knew nothing about asbestos litigation \xe2\x80\x94 nor did he ever do any actual lawyering for the firm. So what did he do? The firm now says it brought him on \xe2\x80\x94 at a base salary of $120,000 a year \xe2\x80\x94 purely to lend it prestige. But in truth, Silver did much more than that. As speaker of the Assembly he could ensure that the legislature did nothing to 'b'clip the wings of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 bar,'b' like setting a cap on damages.'b'He could also solicit client referrals, for which he would receive a piece of the action. This is where Taub comes in. Many doctors who specialize in mesothelioma have a pretty explicit tit-for-tat: They refer patients to firms that help fund their research. 'b'A legal bribe,'b' you might call it. Before Taub and Silver began doing business, the doctor asked for funding from Weitz &amp; Luxenberg. The firm said no. So instead, Silver instructed the Department of Health to make two $250,000 grants to fund Taub\xe2\x80\x99s research. (In a statement, Weitz &amp; Luxenberg said it had no knowledge of Silver\xe2\x80\x99s quid pro quo.)'b'When the grant money ran out, Taub began referring most of his patients to Simmons Hanly Conroy, a big asbestos firm in Illinois. But he still made the occasional referral to Weitz &amp; Luxenberg to curry favor with Silver. In return, Silver got Taub\xe2\x80\x99s son a job, and directed $25,000 in state funds to his wife\xe2\x80\x99s charity. Perfectly legal.'b'There is one other thing Silver could do for Weitz &amp; Luxenberg. He could help make sure that the New York judiciary would look favorably on asbestos cases. The chief judge of the New York State Court of Appeals, Jonathan Lippman, is a childhood friend of Silver\xe2\x80\x99s. And, in 2008, Lippman placed Silver\xe2\x80\x99s good friend Arthur Luxenberg \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the same Luxenberg who was paying Silver $120,000, plus referral fees \xe2\x80\x94 on a committee that recommends judicial appointments. Six months later, a judge named Sherry Klein Heitler was assigned to lead New York City\xe2\x80\x99s dedicated asbestos court.'b'Defense lawyers say that since then, the asbestos court has become the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 bar\xe2\x80\x99s best friend. Prior to Heitler\xe2\x80\x99s appointment, the court had deferred punitive damages claims indefinitely for the sensible reason that since companies stopped making asbestos products decades earlier there was no behavior to correct. But after Weitz &amp; Luxenberg requested that this deferral be lifted, Heitler brought punitive damages back. Mesothelioma cases that had very little in common were consolidated, which pressured defendant companies to settle and, when they didn\xe2\x80\x99t, could lead to huge jury awards. 'b'According to a 2013 report by the American Tort Reform Association,'b' the average jury award for an asbestos claim in New York City since 2007 is $21.7 million. That is \xe2\x80\x9croughly seven times the $3.1 million average award in courts throughout the rest of New York State.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And no firm has had more success than Weitz &amp; Luxenberg. According to the economic consulting firm Bates White, it handles some 53 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s mesothelioma filings. The court itself acknowledged Weitz &amp; Luxenberg cases take precedence over others. It has also won the most money. In July 2013, it won $190 million for five plaintiffs, the most awarded in a New York City asbestos case.'b'Weitz &amp; Luxenberg insists that the judiciary treats everyone fairly, and that it reaps the biggest awards because it does the best job. That may be so. But it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt that Silver also played an important role in setting judicial pay, and that in 2011 his commission appointee 'b'cast the deciding vote'b' in getting the state judges a 27 percent raise.'b'Which, of course, is perfectly legal.'
