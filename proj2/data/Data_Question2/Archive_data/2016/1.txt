b'After 14 years of talks, members of the World Trade Organization have effectively ended the Doha round of negotiations. That was not unexpected given how fruitless these discussions have been. Now, world leaders need to think anew about the global trading system.'b'Countries had hoped that the talks, named after the capital of Qatar, where they began in late 2001, would substantially lower trade barriers, contribute to development in poor nations and tackle difficult issues like agricultural subsidies that were not resolved in earlier pacts, like the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.'b'Failure to achieve this ambitious agenda has undermined the credibility of the multilateral trading system and hurt the least-developed countries, which are desperate to export more of their goods to richer countries.'b'At a meeting of the W.T.O. in mid-December in Nairobi, trade ministers from more than 160 countries 'b'failed to agree'b' that they should keep the negotiations going. In recent years, it became clear that the talks, which were originally supposed to 'b'conclude in 2005'b', were paralyzed because neither developed economies like the United States and the European Union nor developing countries like China and India were willing or able to make fundamental concessions.'b'At the start of the Doha round, American and European officials committed to producing a trade agreement that would 'b'promote development'b' in poorer countries without asking them to reduce import barriers to the same extent as industrialized nations. But as developing countries, particularly China, began exporting far more than they were importing, wealthier countries started demanding that they also lower import barriers and cut subsidies to their farmers. Not surprisingly, China and India refused, insisting on sticking with the original principles.'b'Many countries have been so frustrated by the Doha stalemate that they have been negotiating bilateral and regional trade deals. For example, the United States recently concluded the 'b'Trans-Pacific Partnership'b' with Japan, Vietnam and nine other countries. America and the European Union are also negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. China, which is not part of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has signed many bilateral and regional agreements and proposed a 'b'16-country trade deal'b' that would include India and Japan.'b'Regional agreements can be useful if done right, but they threaten to segregate the world into overlapping trading blocs with different rules in areas like labor rights, environmental protection and access to medicines. And most such pacts \xe2\x80\x94 in which countries agree to eliminate tariffs for products made within the trading bloc \xe2\x80\x94 do not include the world\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'least-developed countries,'b' like Bangladesh and Ethiopia.'b'Another approach is to pursue more limited pacts that include many or all members of the World Trade Organization. A good example is the 'b'Trade Facilitation Agreement'b' reached in December 2013 in which all W.T.O. members agreed to improve their customs departments, border crossings and ports. Under that agreement, less-developed countries will receive aid and technical expertise to help them upgrade their trading systems. Another worthwhile effort that began in 2014 with 14 W.T.O. members, including the United States, China and the European Union, is designed to eliminate tariffs on 'b'environmental goods'b' like solar panels and wind turbines.'b'While pacts focusing on specific issues are easier to negotiate, they can\xe2\x80\x99t cover the broader issues that countries, rich and poor, have to wrestle with. Trade increasingly determines how governments set social policies and labor conditions within domestic markets, and, of course, affects the future of the environment locally as well as globally. The Doha talks may be at a dead end but there has to be a place for global trade pacts that encourage development and sustainable economic growth.'b'The community of Elmont, on Long Island, may soon be getting a neighborhood amenity that\xe2\x80\x99s high-class and exciting, if you think a big carpeted box filled with a thousand video gambling machines is high-class and exciting.'b'On Tuesday the Nassau Regional Off-Track Betting Corporation announced that it would seek New York State\xe2\x80\x99s permission to open a 100,000-square-foot gambling emporium at Belmont Park, the racetrack on the edge of Queens that is home to the Belmont Stakes.'b'We already knew that casino-style gambling was coming to Long Island; that\xe2\x80\x99s because of a deal struck in 2013 by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Dean Skelos, then the powerful Senate Republican leader from Nassau County, when Mr. Cuomo was seeking to legalize full-fledged casino gambling upstate.'b'The agreement 'b'allowed'b' one gambling hall in Nassau County and one in neighboring Suffolk County, each with up to 1,000 video-lottery terminals, or V.L.T.\xe2\x80\x99s, which are similar to slot machines and are wired into the state lottery system. They were going to be a shot in the arm for county officials who were forever clawing for revenue and didn\xe2\x80\x99t care how they got it.'b'From the experience of other places, we know that casinos and gambling are 'b'instruments of blight'b' \xe2\x80\x94 blighted neighborhoods, the blighted lives of problem gamblers and the blighted politics of elected officials who can\xe2\x80\x99t, or won\xe2\x80\x99t, find a better path to economic development.'b'In New York, the plan has long been to attach a dubious financial engine (gambling) to a broken-down heap of an industry (horse racing) and fuel it with people\xe2\x80\x99s thinly stretched paychecks and Social Security benefits. Giving up on better ways of reviving the upstate economy, Mr. Cuomo doubled down on gambling: He engineered the 2013 referendum that rewrote the State Constitution to open the door to seven Las Vegas-style casinos, and then cut the deal for the two video gambling parlors on Long Island.'b'Yet many people in Nassau don\xe2\x80\x99t want slot machines anywhere near their homes. Because of local resistance, the Nassau parlor was never considered for the retail and entertainment heart of the county, called the Hub. Why is that, if gambling is such an economic boon? It was blocked from an OTB \xe2\x80\x9crace palace\xe2\x80\x9d in Plainview and from the site of a shuttered department store in Westbury. In addition, Suffolk\xe2\x80\x99s plan to bring its machines to a shuttered movie multiplex in Brookhaven is mired in a lawsuit.'b'The pro-video-gambling forces in Nassau are counting on the State Legislature and local communities to accept the development at Belmont, and \xe2\x80\x9ccounting\xe2\x80\x9d is quite literal in the case of the county executive, Edward Mangano. He has already put $20 million of gambling revenue in his 2016 budget. That\xe2\x80\x99s based on estimates that the parlor will net at least $150 million a year.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of losing gamblers.'b'This is a big day for Texans yearning to flaunt their handguns in belt and shoulder holsters. A new \xe2\x80\x9copen carry\xe2\x80\x9d law enacted by the Republican Legislature goes into effect on Friday, posing a challenge for law enforcement, businesses and other institutions that are understandably wary of how social interchange will be affected.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s also a big day in Seattle, where the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s new \xe2\x80\x9c'b'gun violence tax'b'\xe2\x80\x9d takes effect, levying a $25 charge on each gun sold and an ammunition tax of 2 to 5 cents per round. The law was upheld in December by a county judge, who found it did not interfere with the right to bear arms and was a legitimate tax to finance gun violence research and help pay for its costly effects. If it survives appeal by the gun lobby, the taxation route deserves to be widely used as a tactic in battling the gun menace.'b'The contrasting developments in Texas and Seattle demonstrate politicians\xe2\x80\x99 tug of war over gun rights and civilian safety, which the gun lobby has been manipulating by pushing through state laws that block local governments from enacting needed ordinances. The resulting crazy quilt of clashing interests demonstrates the need for federal laws, which, of course, have been rejected by a Congress captive to the gun industry\xe2\x80\x99s agenda.'b'The effect of the industry\xe2\x80\x99s power on local streets has the Houston police chief, Charles McClelland, worrying about how his officers will deal with openly armed citizens amid rising fears over mass shootings and terrorism. \xe2\x80\x9cHow are they supposed to know who the good guy or the bad guy is with the gun?\xe2\x80\x9d he asks.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a reasonable question lost in the cheers from many of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 922,197 handgun owners with concealed-carry permits. For gun-rights advocates, the new law solves such problems as how to tote bulkier (and deadlier) large-caliber handguns that proved clumsy under the earlier concealed-carry rules. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to dress around our ability to carry,\xe2\x80\x9d C. J. Grisham, president of Open Carry Texas, said in something of a fashion statement to 'b'T'b'he Wall Street Journal.'b'The Texas law still bans handguns in courthouses, schools, sports arenas and businesses that get more than half their profits from on-site alcohol consumption. But a whole new world of possibilities has been opened, prompting major grocery and restaurant chains and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas to exercise the law\xe2\x80\x99s provision to opt out, which requires a prominent sign prohibiting open carry on their premises. The First Baptist Church of Arlington, on the other hand, decided it was safe to allow its 2,500 worshipers to show up armed.'b'Texas had banned public packing of handguns after the Civil War. That was before the modern gun lobby worked to reverse gun safety laws to the point where variations of open carry now exist in 45 \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s right, 45 \xe2\x80\x94 states. More and more, the open-carry movement is being used to make confrontational and intimidating protest statements.'b'The confusion for the public can be considerable. A woman called 911 in Colorado Springs 'b'in October'b' when she saw a man toting a weapon in the street. She was told the gunman had that right under the open-carry law. The man began a shooting spree outside her door and randomly murdered three innocent people.'b'Wealth can be bad for your soul. That\xe2\x80\x99s not just a hoary piece of folk wisdom; it\xe2\x80\x99s a conclusion from 'b'serious social science'b', confirmed by statistical analysis and experiment. The affluent are, on average, less likely to exhibit empathy, less likely to respect norms and even laws, more likely to cheat, than those occupying lower rungs on the economic ladder.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious, even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t have statistical confirmation, that extreme wealth can do extreme spiritual damage. Take someone whose personality might have been merely disagreeable under normal circumstances, and give him the kind of wealth that lets him surround himself with sycophants and usually get whatever he wants. It\xe2\x80\x99s not hard to see how he could become almost pathologically self-regarding and unconcerned with others.'b'So what happens to a nation that gives ever-growing political power to the superrich?'b'Modern America is a society in which a growing share of income and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a small number of people, and these people have huge political influence \xe2\x80\x94 in the early stages of the 2016 presidential campaign, around 'b'half the contributions'b' came from fewer than 200 wealthy families. The usual concern about this march toward oligarchy is that the interests and policy preferences of the very rich are quite different from those of the population at large, and that is surely the biggest problem.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also true that those empowered by money-driven politics include a disproportionate number of spoiled egomaniacs. Which brings me to the current election cycle.'b'The most obvious illustration of the point I\xe2\x80\x99ve been making is the man now leading the Republican field. Donald Trump would probably have been a blowhard and a bully whatever his social station. But his billions have insulated him from the external checks that limit most people\xe2\x80\x99s ability to act out their narcissistic tendencies; nobody has ever been in a position to tell him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re fired!\xe2\x80\x9d And the result is the face you keep seeing on your TV.'b'But Mr. Trump isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only awesomely self-centered billionaire playing an outsized role in the 2016 campaign.'b'There have been some interesting news reports lately about Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas gambling magnate. Mr. Adelson has been involved in some fairly complex court proceedings, which revolve around claims of misconduct in his operations in Macau, including links to organized crime and prostitution. Given his business, this may not be all that surprising. What was surprising was his 'b'behavior in court'b', where he refused to answer routine questions and argued with the judge, Elizabeth Gonzales. That, as she rightly pointed out, isn\xe2\x80\x99t something witnesses get to do.'b'Then Mr. Adelson bought Nevada\xe2\x80\x99s largest newspaper. As the sale was being finalized, reporters at the paper were told to drop everything and start monitoring all activity of three judges, including Ms. Gonzales. And while the paper never published any results from that investigation, an attack on Judge Gonzales, with what looks like a fictitious byline, did appear in a small Connecticut newspaper owned by one of Mr. Adelson\xe2\x80\x99s associates.'b'O.K., but why do we care? Because Mr. Adelson\xe2\x80\x99s political spending has made him a huge player in Republican politics \xe2\x80\x94 so much so that reporters routinely talk about the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Adelson primary'b',\xe2\x80\x9d in which candidates trek to Las Vegas to pay obeisance.'b'Are there other cases? Yes indeed, even if the egomania doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to Adelson levels. I find myself thinking, for example, of the hedge-fund billionaire Paul Singer, another big power in the G.O.P., who published an investor\xe2\x80\x99s letter 'b'declaring that inflation was running rampant'b' \xe2\x80\x94 he could tell from the prices of Hamptons real estate and high-end art. Economists got some laughs out of the incident, but think of the self-absorption required to write something like that without realizing how it would sound to non-billionaires.'b'Or think of 'b'the various billionaires'b' who, a few years ago, were declaring with straight faces, and no sign of self-awareness, that President Obama was holding back the economy by suggesting that some businesspeople had misbehaved. You see, he was hurting their feelings.'b'Just to be clear, the biggest reason to oppose the power of money in politics is the way it lets the wealthy rig the system and distort policy priorities. And the biggest reason billionaires hate Mr. Obama is 'b'what he did to their taxes'b', not their feelings. The fact that some of those buying influence are also horrible people is secondary.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s not trivial. Oligarchy, rule by the few, also tends to become rule by the monstrously self-centered. Narcisstocracy? Jerkigarchy? Anyway, it\xe2\x80\x99s an ugly spectacle, and it\xe2\x80\x99s probably going to get even uglier over the course of the year ahead.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'As a Haitian activist, I commend The Times for covering the desperate situation in Anse-\xc3\xa0-Pitres (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Haitian Migrants Flee Dominican Republic for Camps Along Border,'b'\xe2\x80\x9d news article, Dec. 13).'b'You accurately describe the plight of these 3,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 mostly Haitian migrants \xe2\x80\x94 who have fled the Dominican Republic in terror from the mounting xenophobia caused by the 2013 Dominican edict revoking citizenship from Dominicans of Haitian descent.

Under the prevailing legal standard, those questions aren\xe2\x80\x99t relevant. Until we make them relevant, American policing will continue to have a tragic excessive force problem and, specifically, a race problem.'b'American police officers killed 74 unarmed black people in 2015. From January through July, according to The Washington Post, unarmed black men were 'b'seven times more likely 'b'than unarmed white men to die by police gunfire.'b''b'An analysis of F.B.I. data 'b'from 2010 to 2012 concluded that the police killed black men ages 15 to 19 at a rate 21 times greater than the statistic for white men the same age. Department of Justice numbers indicate that a black person is about 'b'four times as likely'b' to die in custody or while being arrested than a white person is.'b'What can be done about these appalling facts? Increased use of body and dashboard cameras should help, but will fail to address a fundamental problem.'b'Police officers in the United States are taught that they can use deadly force if they reasonably believe an individual poses a grave, imminent danger to themselves or others. Superficially, this \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d rule looks unobjectionable.'b'But racial bias can affect what seems reasonable. Individuals of all races in America perceive black people as 'b'more aggressive'b' and dangerous than white people. Studies show that black people are seen as being physically stronger and 'b'less prone to feeling pain'b' than people of other races, and black children are often 'b'perceived to be older than they are'b'. When faced with 'b'an armed black target'b', shooters are both more likely to shoot and quicker to shoot than they are when faced with an armed white target.'b'These biases can affect the way we think, judge and act. As a result, force that may seem unreasonable if used against a white person may seem perfectly \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d when used against a black person.'b'One critical and common-sense change would be to adopt a necessity rule. The difference is simple but crucial. Even when the police have a reasonable belief that a person is dangerous, the necessity standard does not permit deadly force if non-deadly or less deadly alternatives are available and adequate to meet the threat.'b'Before objecting that this rule would be impractical or subject officers to 20/20 hindsight, consider that it\xe2\x80\x99s already the 'b'Department of Justice'b'\xe2\x80\x99s standard. As a D.O.J. policy statement puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cThe necessity to use deadly force arises when all other available means of preventing imminent and grave danger to officers or other persons have failed or would be likely to fail.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unfortunately, the D.O.J. necessity standard, adopted in 1995, is not the law; it\xe2\x80\x99s a discretionary policy, and it applies only to federal agencies like the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration. Worse, many state police departments and even some courts have explicitly rejected the necessity rule in favor of a mere reasonableness test. To quote the Seventh Circuit, the federal appeals court that covers Chicago, \xe2\x80\x9cwe do not believe that the Constitution requires the use of the least or even a less deadly alternative so long as the use of deadly force is reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The difference is not semantic; it can be a matter of life or death. A serious necessity rule would require all officers to carry nonlethal weapons and deploy them when feasible. If this rule had been in effect in Chicago, Bettie Jones \xe2\x80\x94 the 55-year-old woman apparently killed by a stray bullet on Dec. 26 by officers responding to a domestic disturbance call \xe2\x80\x94 would almost certainly still be alive.'b'Chicago just 'b'announced'b' that it would equip more officers with 'b'Tasers'b'. But this step was discretionary, too; current law doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require it. And today\xe2\x80\x99s Tasers can also be lethal and are frequently misused. If a necessity standard were rigorously pursued by courts and legislatures, we would develop better nonlethal weaponry, with better training and stronger punishments for misuse.'b'Only eight states legally require their police officers to give a warning, where feasible, before using deadly force. The necessity rule would make this mandatory. The officer who killed Tamir Rice fired less than two seconds after arriving on the scene. If Ohio law had required the police to first try warning Tamir, which they could have done from inside their vehicle, he, too, would probably still be alive.'b'One piece of good news is that the federal appellate court that covers California, the Ninth Circuit, has been edging toward the necessity rule, holding that courts must inquire whether nonlethal alternatives were available in excessive force cases. As a result, in 2014 a district court in San Diego held that officers in a fatal shooting could be held liable because they didn\xe2\x80\x99t use a Taser or try other nonlethal alternatives before opening fire.'b'Police officers often do heroic work, and of course they need leeway for split-second decision making in dangerous situations.

The date of the alleged assault was Jan. 15, 2004, and Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations for rape and sexual assault is 12 years: If prosecutors had delayed two and a half weeks, the limit would have tolled.'b'Mr. Cosby\xe2\x80\x99s public fall in the wake of dozens of accusations has been an education in the reality of sexual assault, especially concerning the long conspiracy of silence, and the weight of shame victims are made to carry, when the suspect is powerful and famous. \xe2\x80\x9cI was a teenager from Denver acting in McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s commercials,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Barbara Bowman, another of his accusers, in The 'b'Washington Post'b' in 2014. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was Bill Cosby.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After decades of unsettling claims and quietly settled lawsuits, Mr. Cosby\xe2\x80\x99s public reputation has gone from America\xe2\x80\x99s dad to America\xe2\x80\x99s creepy uncle. But Mr. Cosby finally faces prosecution only because of a deposition 'b'made public'b' in July: If that testimony had been revealed just a few months later, it could have been too late for prosecutors to try this case.'b'The charging of Mr. Cosby, just under the wire, raises a key question: Why is there a statute of limitations for rape and sexual assault at all? Across the country, 34 states 'b'have'b' statutes of limitations on rape, sexual assault or both, ranging from as little as three years up to 30. (A few states also have reporting deadlines tied to statutes of limitations; and a number of states provide for an exemption from statutes of limitations if a DNA match is later made on a reported rape or sexual assault.)'b'Restrictions on how long charges can be brought after the alleged commission of a crime exist primarily to prevent the deterioration of evidence, but also to promote public order, protect criminal defendants who may have a harder time guarding themselves against long-ago accusations, and encourage plaintiffs to bring cases or report crimes swiftly.'b'Those are laudable goals that make sense in theory. But in practice, they undermine justice for survivors.'b'Most sexual assault survivors don\xe2\x80\x99t report the crime right away, especially if the perpetrator is someone they know \xe2\x80\x94 which applies in about four-fifths of cases. Data from the Department of Justice indicates that rape and sexual assault are the 'b'least reported'b' violent crimes, with only around a third of victims reporting. Even when survivors do go to the police, law enforcement routinely fails to fully investigate their claims. Nationwide, as many as 'b'500,000'b' rape kits still await testing.'b'Among the reasons survivors don\xe2\x80\x99t go to the police, one is the well-founded fear they won\xe2\x80\x99t be believed; another is that they may be 'b'accused of lying'b' or even be 'b'prosecuted themselves'b'. Cases where the accused and the accuser know each other, or where there is little physical evidence, are especially difficult to prove.'b'Even evidence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t guarantee a prosecution. In the 24 states where there is no DNA exemption to the statute of limitations, if a rape kit finally is tested and there\xe2\x80\x99s a match, the victim is out of luck if it has been too long.'b'It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take multiple accusers to bring about a full investigation, but that\xe2\x80\x99s sometimes the reality. The allegations against Mr. Cosby span decades. Once one woman speaks up, others may find the courage to do so. According to New York City crime figures, the number of women willing to report rapes that occurred in previous years is rising rapidly \xe2\x80\x94 a phenomenon that has been called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'the Cosby effect'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Those survivors shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t miss their day in court because they were too traumatized or too scared of possible repercussions to speak out sooner.'b'While good data is lacking on how many suspects are charged a decade or more after the fact, reports of such cases are rare. Some assailants, though, have 'b'gotten off'b' because they admitted to their crimes after the statute of limitations expired.'b'The differing statutes of limitations across state lines create a ZIP code lottery. Where a person is assaulted shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t determine whether she gets justice.'b'An end to statutes of limitations would also allow prosecutors more time to build thorough cases against alleged assailants, instead of rushing up against a dwindling deadline to file slapdash charges, potentially compromising the rights of the accused in the process. It would also allow the accused to defend themselves in a court of law, with its high bar to conviction, rather than in the court of public opinion.'b'Perhaps some state legislators fear ending statutes of limitations for sexual assaults would create chaos and a flood of reports of decades-old crimes. They need not worry: The 16 states with no statute of limitations for rape or sexual assault are not overwhelmed with huge numbers of stale claims.'b'Increasing reporting of rapes and sexual assaults is a complicated challenge, and requires cultural changes as well as improvements in law and policing. For state legislatures to eradicate statutes of limitations for sex crimes is a small enhancement, not a big fix. But for the women and men who find the courage to speak after years of silence and fear, it could be everything.'b'Nearly three years ago, when I first 'b'thought about 'b'living without cable TV, it seemed impractical. But given the proliferation of entertainment choices online, life without cable no longer seems impossible.'b'In early December, I canceled my \xe2\x80\x9ctriple play\xe2\x80\x9d package of TV, telephone and Internet service with Time Warner Cable and switched to a stand-alone Internet access plan. That cut my monthly bill by about $100, without having any impact on how much time I spend in front of my television. Netflix and Amazon Prime have seen to that.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve plowed through the Netflix drama \xe2\x80\x9cSense8\xe2\x80\x9d and watched the 2014 movie \xe2\x80\x9cInterstellar\xe2\x80\x9d on Amazon. Next up is the Amazon series \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man in the High Castle.\xe2\x80\x9d Later, when I run out of things I want to watch on those two services, I might drop them and subscribe to Hulu or HBO Now to watch the movies and TV shows in their libraries.'b'Most Americans still pay for a cable-TV package, but that\xe2\x80\x99s gradually changing as consumers decide there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to pay for several hundred TV channels they don\xe2\x80\x99t watch. At the end of June, 83 percent of American households paid for TV service, down from 87 percent five years earlier, according to estimates by the 'b'Leichtman Research Group'b'. And as cable viewership has declined, so have the profits and the stock prices of some media companies, like 'b'Disney'b' and 'b'Viacom that'b' own cable channels. Cable companies, which distribute channels to consumers over their wires, 'b'have fared better'b' because they are still earning a lot of money selling Internet service.'b'Media companies will need to come up with new strategies as technology works against predetermined bundled content, just as record labels were forced to deal with online music sales and services like Spotify.'b'Some TV networks, like HBO and CBS, have started selling subscriptions directly to viewers over the Internet. But many companies, especially those that broadcast sports, like ESPN, have resisted the trend toward streaming. Insisting that people who want to watch sports must have a cable subscription might help retain die-hard sports fans, but more casual fans like me will continue to drift away.'b'For me, cutting the cord is as much about saving money as it is about controlling my entertainment diet. With cable\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of channels, I would get sucked into a show or movie I happened to land on. Canceling cable has meant becoming more intentional and picking out things I really enjoy. I may end up a bit behind the pop culture curve, but so far, I feel liberated \xe2\x80\x94 and still have access to more shows and movies than I can possibly watch.'b'For Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, 2016 could and should be a year of great achievement. He is not facing re-election and is not seeking a spot on the national Democratic ticket. That means his considerable drive and political talents can be trained on making the state more livable for its 20 million inhabitants, and its government more ethical.'b'Mr. Cuomo will combine two important speeches \xe2\x80\x94 his annual State of the State and his budget address \xe2\x80\x94 in one address on Jan. 13. Here are some ideas.'b'The No. 1 issue should be the most obvious: the abysmal transgressions of the Albany crowd. Mr. Cuomo has acknowledged the need for ethics reform after the corruption convictions of two Albany powerhouses, Sheldon Silver and Dean Skelos. But he keeps trying to lower expectations, arguing that there is little he can do about runaway political spending as long as the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Citizens United decision is in force, and blaming the Republicans in the Legislature for doing nothing to reform its own scandalous behavior.'b'These are excuses meant to shield Mr. Cuomo from future criticism. Of course he will need the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s help. But that does not excuse him from pushing an aggressive agenda.'b'For starters, he should try to close the loophole that allows secretive limited liability companies to contribute as much as individuals can to candidates in statewide races, thus evading the much lower limits imposed on corporations. And he should join the mayors of New York City and Buffalo in refusing to take any more campaign contributions from L.L.C.s.'b'Likewise, unlimited \xe2\x80\x9chousekeeping\xe2\x80\x9d donations to political parties should also be banned. The Joint Commission on Public Ethics, which is supposed to monitor Albany\xe2\x80\x99s politicians, needs to be stronger and more transparent; its failure is one reason Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, has had to do the tough work of rooting out Albany corruption.'b'Mr. Cuomo must lead the way in persuading lawmakers to limit their income from outside work, to state clearly the source of that income and to bar income associated with anyone doing business before the state. More broadly, and more crucially, he should push hard for the public financing of all state candidates, to provide a way for newcomers to compete with hardened incumbents and finally give voters real choices.'b'Mr. Cuomo should find a way to expand paid family leave and move more quickly to a goal he has publicly espoused: a minimum wage of $15 an hour. This will take some doing, given the opposition from Republican senators, but this governor can make it happen.'b'He cut funding for the homeless in New York City in 2011,'b''b' but now he promises an ambitious plan to tackle the problem. That is good news as long as the plan provides adequate funding and leads to a more productive relationship with Mayor Bill de Blasio. He also needs to address disturbing problems in the state prisons, and use contract negotiations with prison guards this spring to hold them accountable for abuse of prisoners.'b'As with the minimum wage, Mr. Cuomo has shown leadership on issues of national and even global importance, including climate change. He has already 'b'announced a goal'b' of having half of the state\xe2\x80\x99s power generated by renewable sources like wind and solar by 2030, and he has ordered state regulators to draw up rules to make that happen. He clearly wants to position New York as a co-leader with California in the fight against climate change. Which is just where New York should be.'b'As they clasped hands while walking down the red carpet at the Lahore airport recently, Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Narendra Modi of India looked more like close friends than the leaders of two countries whose tense relations have long been a threat to regional stability.'b'Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'visit to Pakistan'b' was arranged on short notice and marked the first visit by an Indian prime minister in almost 12 years. Mr. Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s warm greeting and hosting of Mr. Modi at the Sharif family home set a welcome atmosphere for talks aimed at resuming a stalled dialogue on critical economic and security issues. But while the two leaders got the political optics right, the challenge, as always, will be overcoming formidable obstacles at home.'b'Mr. Sharif has pressed for engagement with India; Mr. Modi has been conflicted. He invited Mr. Sharif to his inauguration last year but soon after canceled high-level talks, annoyed that Pakistani diplomats had met with separatist leaders from disputed Kashmir. Mr. Modi has also taken a harder line than his predecessor on security issues involving Pakistan.'b'Domestic constraints limit both leaders, especially Mr. Sharif. His power is eclipsed by an army that controls the fastest-growing nuclear weapons program in the world and has long played a double game of taking American assistance while supporting the Taliban in Afghanistan as well as militants opposed to India.'b'The army exploits tensions with India to bolster its importance in Pakistan. Whether the generals support Mr. Sharif\xe2\x80\x99s new outreach to Mr. Modi is unclear, though it seems clear that contact between the two nuclear-armed countries is imperative given the many points of friction, including Afghanistan and Kashmir.'b'Mr. Modi seems to have finally decided that better relations are not only necessary, but require his personal involvement. He may also have concluded that improved ties with Pakistan could help him realize his domestic ambitions, which include transforming India into an economic power. So far he has not delivered on that promise, spurring protests by middle-class Indians demanding more good jobs.'b'Meanwhile, members of his government and political party have been inflaming sectarian tensions, alarming many Indians and damaging Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s international reputation. A 'b'recent report'b' by the Council on Foreign Relations concluded that without market reforms India risks being left behind in international trade, and that the risk of conflict with Pakistan \xe2\x80\x9cthreatens to drag India down.\xe2\x80\x9d The group said India should seek better relations \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sake of its own future.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One major test of the Modi-Sharif relationship will be whether the two can work together to promote peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban, which has been making gains on the battlefield. Pakistan has given assistance and a haven to the Afghan Taliban as a hedge against India, while India has supported and provided military assistance to the Afghan government.'b'American officials say they believe that Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s army has become more serious about fighting the Taliban and encouraging peace talks because the generals are increasingly worried that a Taliban victory could make Afghanistan a more attractive magnet for the Islamic State and other militants who could threaten Pakistan. Other experts are doubtful. Whether a stronger personal connection between Mr. Modi and Mr. Sharif can lead to real trust and cooperation on such issues remains to be seen.'b'MORE than 57,000 New Yorkers will sleep in a shelter tonight. In this city of glistening wealth, they lack a permanent place to call home. Thousands more suffer outside the shelter system; they are on the streets, bracing for the bitter cold ahead.'b'Many in the system are women and children \xe2\x80\x94 families comprise two-thirds of those in shelters. Nine of 10 homeless families are led by women, many of whom have fled domestic violence. Nearly a third of these women are employed. But their low-wage jobs leave them unable to afford the city\xe2\x80\x99s skyrocketing rents.'b'At Win, the nonprofit I lead, we serve the women and children who are the forgotten face of homelessness in New York. They are mothers and grandmothers and aunts and sisters. They work long hours and make sacrifices few of us can fathom, all to give their children and grandchildren a chance to tap the well of dignity inside each of us and break the cycle of homelessness. They are our neighbors, our fellow New Yorkers. Yet, all too often, we fall short of treating and housing New York\xe2\x80\x99s homeless thoughtfully and with care.'b'Three weeks ago, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a 90-day comprehensive review of city services for the homeless, and a laudable new initiative, Home-Stat, to combat street homelessness. This is an important step to address some of the most visible manifestations of our homelessness crisis. But more is needed.'b'New York has a different agency or office that focuses on just about every challenge homeless families face. Yet little is done to coordinate these services toward the goal of providing permanent housing.'b'Nearly all of those in our shelters are eligible for city-funded housing vouchers. But the agency that oversees cash assistance, which includes vouchers, and job-readiness efforts, the Human Resources Administration, is not the one in charge of shelters. Shelters are instead run by the Department of Homeless Services.'b'We need to combine those two agencies. Until the mid-1990s, services for the homeless were under the purview of the human resources commissioner, and they should be again. This change would be a recognition that homelessness is not an isolated problem; it interacts with, and is a consequence of, a maelstrom of factors \xe2\x80\x94 unaffordable rents, insufficient job training, lack of accessible child care, untreated mental illness and substance abuse, and too few stable work opportunities.'b'Our current shelter system is a hodgepodge of repurposed manufacturing sites and rickety apartment buildings. In the past 20 years, only one new shelter in the system \xe2\x80\x94 Win\xe2\x80\x99s facility on Glenwood Road in Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x94 has been built with families in mind. We need to reimagine our shelters \xe2\x80\x94 and, yes, open new ones \xe2\x80\x94 so that they can offer the holistic services that are critical to equipping homeless families with the skills and treatment they need.'b'Shelters should have free on-site G.E.D. preparation classes and exams. They should offer vocational training programs and job placement support, targeting growth industries where well-paying jobs are most likely to be available. The city could further help by partnering with companies and labor unions to create paths to economic security.'b'Some of these shelters should be built under the same roof as permanent housing and community spaces, to provide a continuum of care and a connection with the neighborhood as well as to leverage existing community resources.'b'Opening new shelters will put thousands of affordable apartments back on the market. For years, the city 'b'has rented apartments'b' and even paid for hotel rooms as temporary shelter units. These apartments and hotel rooms are scattered throughout the city, leaving the homeless without on-site access to support services. The city pays landlords more than someone with a rental voucher can pay, which only exacerbates New York\xe2\x80\x99s already severe housing shortage. More than 3,000 homeless families are housed in apartments that could be permanent homes.'b'Adding quality, integrated shelter capacity and forcing landlords to put up \xe2\x80\x9cfor rent\xe2\x80\x9d signs on these scattered apartments will make more units affordable to working families. This should be a core piece of the mayor\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive housing plan.'b'Another critical focus area is the aftercare services that help families move from shelters to permanent housing. The city has an effective model in Brooklyn, 'b'Home to Stay'b', which provides customized care that gradually decreases in intensity as families become more independent. It should be scaled citywide.'b'We need to learn from what works \xe2\x80\x94 and eliminate what does not, including a web of rules, regulations and laws that run counter to the interests of the homeless. For example, domestic violence survivors 'b'who seek refuge in an emergency shelter'b' should not be uprooted and moved elsewhere after 180 days. This counterproductive policy makes no sense. We should change it.'b'Homelessness is among our city\xe2\x80\x99s most daunting challenges, but it is not intractable. To work with homeless women and children is to be inspired by the grit of mothers who strive daily to improve their kids\xe2\x80\x99 circumstances.'b'They will never accept that better is impossible. Neither can we.'b'LAST month, President Obama inaugurated yet another way to encourage Americans to save for retirement. In the new myRA accounts, workers can save up to $15,000 in a low-fee investment plan that, like a government savings bond, guarantees the principal. The accounts are a small step toward helping households save, but they are not an effective solution to the coming retirement crisis.'b'Starting in 2020, the numbers of very low-income elderly will rise sharply as the retired population soars to almost 56 million. More middle-class working Americans will be poor or near poor after they reach the age of 65. Most currently have inadequate 401(k)-type accounts or no retirement account at all. For good reason, voters tell pollsters that their top economic concern is retirement security.'b'We need a bolder plan, which we are calling the guaranteed retirement account (G.R.A.). Under our proposal, all workers and employers will have to make regular payments into a G.R.A., which builds until retirement age, then pays out a supplemental stream of income until that person and his or her beneficiary die.'b'The current system \xe2\x80\x94 a mix of 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts (I.R.A.s) \xe2\x80\x94 is broken. These plans are individually directed, voluntary and leaky. Just over half of workers don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to a workplace retirement plan. According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, Americans between the ages of 40 and 55 have retirement savings of $14,500, when they will need between 20 and 30 times that amount. Many people take money out before they retire. And the wealthy tend to pay lower fees and get higher subsidies for their savings.'b'A bigger flaw is the way these plans hinder wise investing. Individualized retirement accounts are effectively restricted to short-term liquid stocks and bonds because they are designed to allow people to withdraw their money before retirement. So employees are paying for liquidity they don\xe2\x80\x99t need and achieving subpar results. Traditional pension plans consistently perform better because they are diversified in long- and short-term investments.'b'In our plan, the more than 95 million workers without a pension plan would each have his or her own G.R.A. managed by an independent federal agency. Workers and employers would each contribute a mandatory minimum of 1.5 percent of the salary or contract. The current tax deduction for retirement savings would be converted to a $600 refundable tax credit to pay for the contributions of households below median income.'b'Workers could not withdraw money early, even for emergencies \xe2\x80\x94 and they won\xe2\x80\x99t like that. But allowing exceptions creates a slippery slope. Just as Social Security is protected from early withdrawal, retirement accounts should be used for old-age income. Employers won\xe2\x80\x99t like paying more. But in return, they are free from administrating and worrying about providing retirement plans if they don\xe2\x80\x99t offer a 401(k) or pension. In the long run, employers would benefit because a nation of financially secure retirees would pre-empt higher corporate taxes.'b'Individuals would not make investment decisions directly. Instead, low-fee diversified retirement portfolios would be created by a board of professionals who would be fiduciaries appointed by the president and Congress and held accountable to investors. The fees and investments would be much less prone to corruption because the managers\xe2\x80\x99 income would not depend on the investments, the fees would be disclosed, and the accounts separated from government funds and owned by the individuals.'b'Since contributions would be pooled and fees kept low, a guarantee of a return of around 3 percent \xe2\x80\x94 about half the expected return on stocks over the long term \xe2\x80\x94 would be essentially costless even as the underlying rate fluctuated with the market and inflation. For someone making an average salary of about $48,000, a 3 percent contribution would yield about $170,000 over a lifetime. Three percent is not an adequate saving rate, it is a starting base. Our plan would provide a lifelong annuity, like a defined benefit plan, so no one would face the risk of outliving his or her money.'b'This proposal would require federal legislation. Many states, like California, are now implementing a version of what we are proposing, but the plans aren\xe2\x80\x99t mature enough for us to know if they work. People in their 50s and 60s won\xe2\x80\x99t be helped as much as younger people, but some savings can help delay collecting Social Security. Most nations support retirees through universal two-tier systems consisting of a Social Security-type plan and funded workplace pensions. Our plan would guarantee millions of Americans safe and secure retirements that would benefit them, their families and the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Aging Society Changes Story on Poverty in Old Age'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Economic Scene, Dec. 23), Eduardo Porter concludes that it is becoming more challenging for American retirees to avoid poverty.'b'Social Security is indeed critical to preventing poverty among older Americans, and AARP, in its Take a Stand campaign, is pressing every presidential candidate to unveil his or her plan to ensure that the program remains financially sound.'b'But as Mr. Porter also noted, private pensions and personal savings make up the rest of the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cthree-legged retirement stool.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unfortunately, workplace retirement savings options are unavailable to over half of New York State\xe2\x80\x99s private-sector workers 18 to 64 and a quarter of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Generation X and baby boomer voters, according to AARP surveys and research.'b'With Americans 15 times as likely to save if they can do so at work, AARP is urging Gov.

Waiting lists for youth shelters stretch into the hundreds.'b'The results are tragic. Homeless youths sleep on the subway or in public parks and abandoned buildings.

Pour les islamistes, la femme est source du mal : elle repr\xc3\xa9sente le corps, le charnel, et donc s\xc3\xa9pare l\xe2\x80\x99homme de Dieu. Pour le militant de base du Front National, la femme moderne est 'b'source du trouble'b' dans la soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9.

Une contradiction similaire est visible chez les islamistes : leur discours r\xc3\xa9trograde et sexiste est souvent d\xc3\xa9fendu par des femmes, couvertes, qui vantent le voile comme outil de lib\xc3\xa9ration.'b'Les parall\xc3\xa8les sont tels que certains accusent l\xe2\x80\x99extr\xc3\xaame droite de faire le jeu des islamistes en encourageant elle aussi une rupture au sein de la soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 occidentale.

A cause for hope? Too little, it turns out.'b'Throughout the Muslim world, a harsh campaign was conducted against people who celebrate Christmas. In Algeria, Islamists worked the streets under the regime\xe2\x80\x99s tolerant eye, distributing leaflets denouncing the day as unholy, discouraging customers in pastry shops from buying Yule logs and cakes, and sermonizing in mosques. In Brunei and Somalia, celebrating Christmas could 'b'lead to imprisonment'b'.'b'The Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 argument came down to one essential point: To celebrate Christmas or New Year\xe2\x80\x99s was to imitate the \xe2\x80\x9cKuffar'b',\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'or atheists, which is to say, basically, Westerners. At all cost the man in the white beard had to be kept away from the men with black beards.'b'Pointing out that Christmas is Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 birthday and that Jesus is a recognized prophet in the genealogy of the Quran would have served no purpose. The Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 mental cartography is binary: \xe2\x80\x9cDar el-Islam, Dar el-Koffr\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Land of Islam versus Land of Impiety. They want to de-Westernize the Arab world.'b'Is it permissible to celebrate the birth of Buddha? Islamists don\xe2\x80\x99t much wonder about that, if only because it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t help them tap anticolonial sentiment or play it up to legitimize themselves. Their enemy is the West, both because of its very nature and because of its military aggressions and economic predations. Islamist literature invokes religion to reject the West, as the land of Crusaders and Jews.'b'But the war of the calendar also goes further: It touches even the birthday of the Prophet Muhammad, though that was consecrated a long time ago. For purists of Islam, the way Muslims celebrate Mawlid, the birthday of Muhammad, today \xe2\x80\x94 with street processions, fireworks, special dishes or new clothes for children \xe2\x80\x94 is a folkloric deviation from doctrine. It is a \xe2\x80\x9cBid\xe2\x80\x99ah,\xe2\x80\x9d an innovation. And innovation implies dissidence, overthrow and revolution: For Islamists, especially Wahhabists, behind every novelty lurks the devil.'b'To celebrate a birthday, even that of a prophet, is to accept the existence of Time, whereas Islamists fantasize about eternity. In their eyes, Time itself is a crime, because it is a departure from original Islam. Thus restoration is the Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 second foundational myth. Their goal is to return to the beginning of Time, to T=0. To the moment of Revelation, when the prophet was still alive and God was so close to his ear. To the moment when Islam had not yet been soiled, to before it was contaminated by History and \xe2\x80\x9cFitna,\xe2\x80\x9d the first Muslim civil wars, which followed the death of Muhammad.'b'This quest for purity also explains Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 relation to physical space. In addition to wanting to conquer territory, the Islamic State seeks to negate and destroy any evidence of the passing of time, such as monuments and ruins, in Palmyra and elsewhere. It tries to extend the desert\xe2\x80\x99s domain: to replace walls with sand, to flatten out landscape, to return to a vacuum so as to start history all over again.'b'The purification myth is not the exclusive purview of Salafists. It also runs through other utopian and totalitarian movements, as well as some of the Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 enemies, like the far-right political parties of today. All of them share the same fantasy of returning to some (imagined) original state of purity.'b'The far right in France, for example, wants to go back to \xe2\x80\x9cla souche,\xe2\x80\x9d its roots, and restore the land of its Gallic ancestors to what it was before immigrants, the Stranger, flooded in. Like the Islamists, it glorifies geography and negates Time.'b'Islamists and far-right groups also share an awkward relationship to women. For Islamists, women are a source of evil: They represent the body, the carnal, and separate men from God. For average militants of the National Front, the modern woman is a 'b'source of disorder'b' in society. And so they promote policies both nativist and 'b'natalist'b', with feudal undertones, that extol the benefits of 'b'breeder housewives'b'. This is the case even though the party is now led by two women. A similar contradiction exists among Islamists: Their retrograde, sexist talk is often defended by women who cover themselves and praise the head scarf as a tool of emancipation.'b'The parallels are such that some people accuse the far right of doing the Islamists\xe2\x80\x99 bidding by also seeking to cause a rift within Western society. After the first round of recent regional elections in France \xe2\x80\x94 a test tube of a country when it comes to the cooked-up confrontation between the two camps \xe2\x80\x94 a cartoonist drew a Salafist yelling \xe2\x80\x9cWe won!\xe2\x80\x9d in response to the National Front\xe2\x80\x99s record showing at the polls.'b'Christmas coincided with Mawlid this year, for the first time in centuries. But the happenstance has highlighted the shared features of Islamists and far-rightists, which usually remain hidden. The two camps feed on each other, providing mutual reinforcement.'b'One might counter that of the two groups, only Muslim extremists kill. Which is true, at least when it comes to people. But the extremists of the right kill humanism, and that\xe2\x80\x99s the only thing that could save us all.'b'MONTREAL \xe2\x80\x94 AS scandals go, it was a juicy one. Volkswagen, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'highest grossing'b' automakers, persuaded consumers it had created a new generation of so-called clean diesel cars \xe2\x80\x94 until investigators discovered that defeat devices, which activated emissions controls only when the cars were tested, were concealing the fact that its vehicles emitted up to 40 times the permitted levels of pollutants during regular use.'b'Volkswagen has been punished with consumer opprobrium, a costly recall and plummeting sales. Yet the public outrage over the fraud obscures a much larger issue.'b'Volkswagen played a leading role in convincing people to accept a technology that in many countries is causing a precipitous decline in air quality for millions of city-dwellers: the diesel engine. Monitoring sites in European cities like London, Stuttgart, Munich, Paris, Milan and Rome have 'b'reported'b' high levels of the nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, or soot, that help to create menacing smogs.'b'Recently, officials in Milan temporarily 'b'barred'b' cars from the city; in Rome, too, persistent smog has forced the authorities to limit the use of private vehicles. Back in March, Paris was 'b'enveloped'b' in a gray cloud of choking fumes that obscured the Eiffel Tower for hours and briefly earned the French capital the title of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most polluted city, beating out even Beijing. An air quality expert in Britain 'b'reported'b' that much of it was \xe2\x80\x9cstale diesel\xe2\x80\x9d from traffic emissions generated in European cities.'b'This diesel pollution is not just unpleasant; it is also dangerous. The nitrogen oxides produced by diesel engines, which are far more popular in Europe than in the United States, are a potent irritant for asthma sufferers. Health officials in Italy also noted increased reports of cardiovascular disease this week.'b'Diesel exhaust is laden with insidious soot particles, the so-called PM 2.5 (particulate matter smaller than 2.5 microns, or one-thirtieth the width of a human hair), which 'b'allow'b' carcinogens to penetrate deep into tissues and organs. In other words, a driver who steps on the accelerator of a diesel car may be filling the lungs of nearby pedestrians, cyclists, infants in strollers and other drivers with potentially deadly particulate matter.'b'According to one'b' study'b', 9,416 premature deaths in London in 2010 were attributed to nitrogen dioxide and PM 2.5 particles. Annual deaths linked to air pollution in Britain as a whole now rival the death toll in the early 1950s, when \xe2\x80\x9cpea souper\xe2\x80\x9d fogs caused by coal fires 'b' shrouded'b' the capital for weeks.'b'How did we get here?'b'The German engineer 'b'Rudolf Diesel'b' must have thought he was on to a good thing when he built his prototype engine in 1893. Unlike gasoline engines, diesel engines required no spark plugs to ignite the fuel injected into each cylinder: Pressure and high temperatures caused it to combust spontaneously.'b'Diesel\xe2\x80\x99s engine also ran on a grade of fuel far less flammable than gasoline. More economical than other internal combustion engines, diesels became the workhorses of the 20th century: They powered ships, trains, trucks and tanks; they cut trees, dug ore and drove factories. Generations of children in rural areas got to school thanks to buses running on diesel.'b'The diesel engine is inherently efficient: Even a heavy sedan can get as much as 50 miles per gallon, while 'b'producing'b' fewer carbon dioxide emissions per mile. The relatively light carbon footprint of Diesel\xe2\x80\x99s invention meant that in the late 1990s, policy makers in Europe, eager to meet Kyoto Protocol goals, initiated a \xe2\x80\x9cdash for diesel.\xe2\x80\x9d Consumers got a push from sharply reduced taxes on diesel fuel.'b'In Europe, where tens of millions of cars run on diesel, 55 percent of all new vehicle registrations are now for diesel cars. Thanks also to 'b'a glut'b' of cheap diesel from Russian refineries, which last year ramped up production to half a million barrels a day, diesel is now a cheap option at many gas stations.'b'Industry soon took the hint: Diesel could be marketed as green. The Diesel Technology Forum\xe2\x80\x99s website 'b'proclaims 'b'that \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s ultralow sulfur diesel, advanced engines and effective emissions control combine to achieve near zero emissions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the United States, which has some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s toughest air pollution laws, automakers worked hard to convince consumers that a new generation of \xe2\x80\x9cclean diesel\xe2\x80\x9d cars were far less polluting. Volkswagen heavily promoted its \xe2\x80\x9cTDI\xe2\x80\x9d (turbocharged direct injection) technology.'b'We know better now. As anybody who has seen the black smoke spewing out of the pipes of a big rig as it changes gears can testify, diesel has a fatal flaw. It tends to burn dirty, particularly at low speeds and temperatures. In cities, where so much driving is stop and start, incomplete diesel combustion produces pollution that is devastating for human health.'b'Fortunately, Volkswagen sold under half a million of its \xe2\x80\x9cclean diesel\xe2\x80\x9d cars to the American public before the emissions scandal broke. Today, fewer than 1 percent of the passenger vehicles sold in the United States run on diesel fuel.'b'So Americans have a head start on Europe, where policy makers are belatedly coming to view diesel as a devil\xe2\x80\x99s bargain. In a bid to make quick gains in the fight to slow global warming, they abetted a dramatic and quickly apparent decline in urban air quality. It turns out opting for diesel may even have failed to limit climate change: Researchers at Stanford 'b'found'b' in 2002 that the warming because of soot from diesel emissions may more than offset the cooling because of reduced carbon dioxide emissions over the long term.'b'Europe is now scrambling to undo the damage. In London, Mayor Boris Johnson last year called for a national program to pay some drivers to scrap their diesel vehicles. In Paris, Mayor Anne Hidalgo has 'b'gained'b' broad support for a proposed ban on diesel cars.'b'City leaders have a ways to go. On half a dozen visits to Europe in the last five years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve marveled at the way traffic-limiting policies, along with better transit and bicycle infrastructure, have made life there more pleasant. While I envy such smart advances in urbanism and transportation, I\xe2\x80\x99ve also noticed a paradoxical decline in air quality.'b'Elsewhere around the world, such forward-thinking leaders as Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1alosa, the recently 'b're-elected'b' mayor of Bogot\xc3\xa1, Colombia, are betting on public transit, rather than private cars, to keep their cities moving. Battling its own smog problem, Bogot\xc3\xa1 'b'now has'b' a pilot project to replace its rapid transit system\xe2\x80\x99s diesel-powered buses with Chinese-made electric vehicles. Officials in Madrid 'b'have gone'b' further, with plans to make its city center car-free by 2020.'b'Last month, the signatories of the climate deal in Paris agreed that the world has to begin a long-term shift from fossil fuels to more sustainable forms of energy. Recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cclean diesel\xe2\x80\x9d for the oxymoron it is would be a good place to start.'b'In recent years, Congress and the Pentagon have stood in the way of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s goal of shutting down the prison at Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay, Cuba. The legislative hurdles have been predictable in a Republican-led Congress that so often opposes Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s initiatives reflexively. The stalling at the Defense Department, where officials have used every bureaucratic trick in the book to slow down the release of inmates, is startling, though, and basically amounts to insubordination.'b''b'A Reuters article'b' on Tuesday shed new light on the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s obstinance on Guant\xc3\xa1namo and the extent to which the department has sought to keep detainees locked away for years without due process in a prison established to sidestep the Constitution and international law.'b'Officials at the Pentagon, Reuters reported, scuttled a potential plan to resettle 'b'Tariq Ba Odah'b', a Yemeni detainee who has been imprisoned since 2002 and was cleared for release in 2009. He is now severely malnourished from having been on a hunger strike for almost nine years. After officials at the State Department persuaded officials from a foreign government to consider taking Mr. Ba Odah in September, those officials made the reasonable request to examine his medical records. Mr. Ba Odah\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer approved the request. The Pentagon, however, stalled for six weeks, preposterously arguing that it was protecting Mr. Ba Odah\xe2\x80\x99s privacy. Mr. Ba Odah remains locked up, raising the likelihood that he will die in detention.'b'In interviews with Reuters, former senior American officials have criticized the Pentagon with unusual candor. James Dobbins, the former State Department envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said that dealing with the Pentagon on Guant\xc3\xa1namo issues was like \xe2\x80\x9cpunching a pillow.\xe2\x80\x9d The reasons are political and ideological. Congress has for several years required that the defense secretary personally sign off on every release and assert that the risk of recidivism has been mitigated. That requirement raised fears of political backlash should a detainee take up arms abroad and became an excuse to delay decisions. Beyond that, some officials see value in having a permanent offshore prison available for terrorism suspects.'b'Time after time, officials at the Pentagon have found ways to delay releases. For instance, Gen. John Kelly, the commander of the United States Southern Command, which oversees the naval base in Cuba, has made it unnecessarily hard for foreign delegations to visit the prison. This has stymied negotiations with countries that have been willing to explore the possibility of taking Guant\xc3\xa1namo detainees whom the American government won\xe2\x80\x99t send back to their countries because of security concerns.'b'Despite the Pentagon\xe2\x80\x99s intransigence, the White House hopes to reduce the inmate population of 107 significantly over the next few months. 'b'Seventeen detainees 'b'who have received final transfer approval are scheduled for release in the coming weeks. Officials say that as many as 30 more could be released by the summer, reducing the count to roughly 60. The smaller the number the more likely that the detainees could be moved to a prison in the United States until a final disposition can be made in their cases.'b'Pentagon officials can do a lot to thwart releases during Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s last year in office. He can make that less likely by empowering a senior official to set clear goals and deadlines, and order defense officials to meet them.'b'No one called it terrorism back then, but the angst of day-to-day existence during the Cold War was chillingly recalled with the 'b'release last month 'b'of the government\xe2\x80\x99s top-secret nuclear target list for 1959. \xe2\x80\x9cPopulation\xe2\x80\x9d was the obscenely brief title of target category No. 275 \xe2\x80\x94 population, as in the citizens of major cities who war planners estimated would necessarily die by the millions.'b'In my neighborhood, people had vague apocalyptic notions, though it felt plain crazy to believe that the doctrine known as MAD, or \xe2\x80\x9cmutual assured destruction,\xe2\x80\x9d could actually happen. Against this grim though remote possibility, the whole idea of civil defense seemed lame, when the best the government could do was to designate a few thousand of the most mundane New York apartment house basements as supposedly impenetrable \xe2\x80\x9cnuclear fallout shelters\xe2\x80\x9d for a city of millions. What \xe2\x80\x94 survival in Brooklyn on soda crackers, drums of water and aspirin?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDuck and cover\xe2\x80\x9d jokes and tight-lipped laughter became the real civil defense in the Cold War. It felt smarter to seek survival in satire like Stanley Kubrick\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Strangelove.\xe2\x80\x9d Or in Mort Sahl\xe2\x80\x99s stand-up skewering of Dr. Wernher von Braun, the captured German rocket scientist, who metamorphosed into an American space-age hero. Mr. von Braun said in his best-selling autobiography that \xe2\x80\x9cI aim at the stars.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sahl amended, \xe2\x80\x9csometimes hit London,\xe2\x80\x9d.'b'Backyard fallout shelters and bank loans to build them were promoted in the suburbs, but salesmen eventually went bust peddling doomsday. Politicians eager to guarantee protection were soon ensnared in nuances resembling today\xe2\x80\x99s bickering over carpet bombing. (Could a shelter owner morally use a gun to deter neighbors when the attack came?)'b'The man President John F. Kennedy designated as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first nuclear civil defense chief, Steuart Pittman, was supposed to guarantee 180 million Americans shelter space stocked with two weeks of food, water and medicine. He met budget resistance in Congress and apathy from the public. \xe2\x80\x9cI hate to hear people say that they would prefer to die in a nuclear attack rather than face the horrors of survival,\xe2\x80\x9d he complained as the plan faded.'b'By 1970, ordinary citizens, though certainly still targeted by the Kremlin, had distractions like Vietnam to worry about. Then suddenly the notion of nuclear Armageddon reappeared with the discovery by the New York State Assembly during a routine session that the state, in 1963, had actually constructed a bomb shelter with 4\xc2\xbd-foot-thick walls and drawn up a list of 700 or so people who would be privileged to survive in it.'b'The long-forgotten shelter was a quiet, pet project of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, who was also one of the era\xe2\x80\x99s chief promoters of bunkers. Immediately, questions arose among the lawmakers: Why didn\xe2\x80\x99t I know about this until now? More urgently: How do I get on the list? And from one legislator: What about my constituents?'b'As the debate prattled on, a sane voice cut through the chamber. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99d do better to trust in God,\xe2\x80\x9d boomed Assemblyman Guy Brewer, \xe2\x80\x9crather than put money in a hole in the ground where only a few Herrenvolk would be saved.\xe2\x80\x9d The scene faded to grim laughter, a whistling past the nuclear graveyard, the same civil defense employed by the targeted populations back home.'b'DEMOGRAPHY is destiny, or so the saying goes, but Latinos are learning this political season that destiny can take detours.'b'As their population in the United States surged from 'b'35 million in 2000'b' to nearly 57 million, Latinos became the subjects of a feel-good political story that bathed a marginalized minority in the glow of demographic triumphalism. Acting as a cohesive political force, Latinos were supposed to power Democratic majorities for decades and enshrine the welcoming immigration policies they overwhelmingly favor.'b'Instead, the 2016 campaign is showing how viscerally the paranoia of a majority can take aim at those gaining ground. Rather than a moment of triumph, this could be the year of the Latino eclipse.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cToday we march. Tomorrow we vote.\xe2\x80\x9d That chant brought more than a million people into the 'b'streets'b' in 2006 to protest tough immigration policies promoted by conservative Republicans. Since then Latinos have held to an ethnic empowerment strategy based on a single policy objective \xe2\x80\x94 citizenship for unauthorized immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 and a single tactic \xe2\x80\x94 becoming an essential constituency in presidential elections.'b'Sure enough, in 'b'2008'b' and 'b'2012'b' about two-thirds of the Hispanic electorate backed the candidate who promised a path to citizenship. But Barack Obama did not deliver, even when his party controlled both houses of Congress, and then he earned the title \xe2\x80\x9c'b'deporter in chief'b'\xe2\x80\x9d by hustling nearly 'b'two million'b' unauthorized immigrants back across the border.'b'Nonetheless, here we are again. Latinos are rolling the dice for a third time, betting most everything on one issue, one party and one candidate. Trouble is, the game has changed but the strategy hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Despite a decade of trying, Latinos are finding that legalization grows more remote. Immigration advocates who once demanded nothing less than citizenship for all 11 million unauthorized immigrants would now settle for the 'b'temporary reprieve'b' from deportations ordered by President Obama more than a year ago. That plan covers only about half of the unauthorized population with no guarantee of legalization, and 'b'red-state governors'b' have blocked it with a 'b'lawsuit now before the Supreme Court'b'.'b'Meanwhile, the immigration battle has produced no name-brand leaders, and despite sporadic successes, the new faces in advocacy, such as the National Day Laborer Organizing Network and United We Dream, have not developed into institutions of sustained influence. Worse, immigration advocacy has not produced powerful alliances for Latinos, but it has aroused some notable enemies.'b'In opinion polls, Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 partners in the Obama coalition say they favor legalization, but immigration gets scant resources from liberal interest groups compared with gun control, marriage equality or climate change. There is plenty of commitment and passion on the other side, however. Conservative Republicans consistently list a crackdown on unauthorized migration as a top priority, and the president\xe2\x80\x99s executive orders have imbued the issue with the extraordinarily personal animus he provokes among his foes.'b'A backlash was predictable given the vast demographic change that Latinos are part of: 'b'For the past five years, the majority of babies born have not been white.'b' Middle-class economic worries and populist anger at elites added fuel to white anxieties. Then the Washington deadlock over unauthorized migration provided a target. Still, the particular ugliness of the presidential campaign was hard to see coming. With Donald J. Trump stirring the caldron, fear of terrorism is combining with nativism to produce a strain of xenophobia as virulent as any in decades.'b'Even more surprising is the lack of a Latino response. In past election seasons young unauthorized immigrants, the Dreamers, have 'b'staged protests to demand immigration reform'b', but they have yet to take on Mr. Trump loudly. Given his vitriol, you would expect large demonstrations. Compared with Black Lives Matter protesters, Latinos seem passive. In that case, young people, loosely connected by social media and operating outside of institutions, took action that made race resurgent in politics and policy. Similar activism and strengthening of group bonds could still develop among Latinos. If not, then you have to wonder whether political analysts have assigned immigration too great a role in the Hispanic psyche.'b'More oddly still, the most prominent Latinos on the political stage are conservative Republicans who take a hard line on immigration enforcement. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida challenge what it means to be a Latino leader by promoting policies at odds with a majority of Latino voters, but nonetheless they are the sons of Latin American immigrants. To 'b'label them \xe2\x80\x9ctraitors,\xe2\x80\x9d as some activists have done'b', renders the term \xe2\x80\x9cLatino\xe2\x80\x9d a political affiliation based on a litmus test, not an ethnicity that can claim the power of census numbers.'b'Both Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio are eloquent proponents of the aspirational narrative \xe2\x80\x94 my father had nothing \xe2\x80\x94 that is more universal and more intrinsic to Latino identity than the Spanish language. Both are betting that the polls are right in showing that Latinos care more about economic issues than about immigration. They\xe2\x80\x99ll try to pull Latino voters with a message of less government, more jobs. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to get many to have an impact.'b'In their Senate elections, Mr. Cruz 'b'drew at least 35 percent of the Latino vote'b' in Texas, while Mr. 'b'Rubio got 55 percent in Florida'b'. A Republican ticket that solidly tops the roughly 40 percent share of the Latino vote captured by George W. Bush in 2004 would upend the notion that Latino population growth dooms the Republican Party. Faced with that possibility, the Democrats could hoist a Latino into the spotlight. Hillary Clinton, who 'b'backs a path to citizenship'b', has already said she\xe2\x80\x99ll 'b'\xe2\x80\x9creally look hard\xe2\x80\x9d'b' at Juli\xc3\xa1n Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and current secretary of housing and urban development, as a possible running mate.'b'By taking increasingly hard positions on enforcement and against legalization, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio have further polarized the already harsh politics of immigration. They\xe2\x80\x99ve cut maneuvering room for moderate Republicans, and they have complicated choices for Latinos.'b'If either senator draws a sizable share of their votes, Latinos might gain the clout that comes with being swing voters. But that would shatter the notion of ethnic solidarity with unauthorized immigrants. Latinos might find unity by rallying against the Republican hard line on immigration, but then they will be reduced to not only one issue but also one party. If the Democrats own their votes because there is no alternative on immigration, what leverage do Latinos exercise on jobs and education, the issues they say they care about most?'b'AS the election year unfolds, a wild card looms on the Rio Grande where 'b'signs point to a renewed surge of Central American refugees'b'. So far, Mrs. Clinton has issued only a 'b'noncommittal expression of concern'b' over reports that the Obama administration 'b'plans a crackdown'b'. If women and children end up in 'b'detention centers'b', as they have in the past, and Mrs. Clinton backs the president, Latinos could find themselves with no candidate taking a fully sympathetic position on immigration.'b'Over the years, Latinos have claimed a political destiny based on their population numbers, but the numbers that count in politics are those that decide elections. On that score Latinos have a dismal record to overcome.'b'Between 'b'2000'b' and 'b'2012'b' the number of Hispanics eligible to vote grew by almost 10 million, but the number of actual voters increased by half as much. Even with immigration reform on the line, 'b'fewer than half of eligible Latino voters'b' cast ballots in the two Obama elections, compared with around two-thirds of whites and blacks. This lackadaisical approach to civic engagement extends even to the population most affected by federal immigration policies. Eligible immigrants from Mexico adopt United States citizenship 'b'at about half the rate'b' that newcomers from all other countries do.'b'Latino concerns on immigration policy, Latino candidates and Latino voters nationwide seem certain to draw significant attention this year. The demand for citizenship on behalf of unauthorized immigrants will ring hollow if people who are eligible for citizenship do not naturalize and Latino citizens do not vote. Latino voters have the potential to exert real political power. But a failure to show up on Election Day will eclipse any strength in numbers.'b'The psychiatrist and brain researcher Nora Volkow is the director of the 'b'National Institute on Drug Abuse'b'.'b''b'READING'b' 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Blazing World\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Siri Hustvedt.

The book dwells on gender bias and what is reality and what is perception in the art world.'b'Also 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOrfeo\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Richard Powers, which is about this man who is trying to generate a musical composition using patterns of nucleotides in DNA.

Could we use the language of biology to perpetuate music?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cEuphoria\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Lily King is the last book I read, and it tells a fascinating story about anthropologists trying to understand the different cultures in New Guinea. It raises the question, can we really understand something that is different from us or are we just changing it, and on that basis can we really understand? It\xe2\x80\x99s the same concept that the moment you interact with anyone you are changed by that other.'b'I am from Mexico City, so also I like very much Latin American literature, particularly 'b'Mario Vargas Llosa'b' and 'b'Roberto Bola\xc3\xb1o'b', which I prefer to read in Spanish but will read in English just because sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s easier to get my hands on.'b''b'LISTENING'b' I have had passion for 'b'Beethoven'b' and then 'b'Rachmaninoff'b', 'b'Stravinsky'b' and 'b'Shostakovich'b'.

It is a marvel to me the capacity of his music to elicit such strong emotion even though it\xe2\x80\x99s so old.'b''b'WATCHING'b' 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Lobster,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' which is a British movie I saw with my niece when we were together in Paris. The movie challenges, in a satirical way, our inflexibility to accept other points of view, specifically around the notion that you should be married. And I also recently watched 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLeviathan,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' which is a Russian film about the bureaucratic systems we create that can destroy the spirits of men. It\xe2\x80\x99s visually very stunning and the use of metaphor is very powerful.'b''b'FOLLOWING'b' I don\xe2\x80\x99t follow anything. I am an oddity. But the National Institutes of Health provides us every day a list of key relevant items in journals. For example, a study on 'b'sleep'b', how it is a cleaning process in the brain, which changed my own research. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been obsessed to try to understand what are these mechanisms because sleep is a challenge in the treatment of people with addictions. If they can\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, they may go back to marijuana or drink alcohol to relax. Also, when we are sleep-deprived our ability to exert self-regulation is degraded, so we are more likely to take risks or binge.'b''b'RECEIVING'b' I recently received a photographic album that belonged to a dear friend who died of cancer. It was her husband who gave it to me. She was a Russian scientist who worked in my laboratory. I had known her for 15 years.

She loved to go hiking in mountains. And she had grandchildren. I had never seen her interact with her grandchildren. It\xe2\x80\x99s like I have a piece of her.'b'STUART SLAVIN, a pediatrician and professor at the Saint Louis University School of Medicine, knows something about the impact of stress. After uncovering alarming rates of anxiety and depression among his medical students, Dr. Slavin and his colleagues remade the program: implementing pass/fail grading in introductory classes, instituting a half-day off every other week, and creating small learning groups to strengthen connections among students. Over the course of six years, the students\xe2\x80\x99 rates of depression and anxiety dropped considerably.'b'But even Dr. Slavin seemed unprepared for the results of testing he did in cooperation with Irvington High School in Fremont, Calif., a once-working-class city that is increasingly in Silicon Valley\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. He had anonymously surveyed two-thirds of Irvington\xe2\x80\x99s 2,100 students last spring, using two standard measures, the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. The results were stunning: 54 percent of students showed moderate to severe symptoms of depression. More alarming, 80 percent suffered moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is so far beyond what you would typically see in an adolescent population,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the school\xe2\x80\x99s faculty at a meeting just before the fall semester began. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s unprecedented.\xe2\x80\x9d Worse, those alarming figures were probably an underestimation; some students had missed the survey while taking Advanced Placement exams.'b'What Dr. Slavin saw at Irvington is a microcosm of a nationwide epidemic of school-related stress. We think of this as a problem only of the urban and suburban elite, but in traveling the country to report on this issue, I have seen that this stress has a powerful effect on children across the socioeconomic spectrum.'b'Expectations surrounding education have spun out of control. On top of a seven-hour school day, our kids march through hours of nightly homework, daily sports practices and band rehearsals, and weekend-consuming assignments and tournaments. Each activity is seen as a step on the ladder to a top college, an enviable job and a successful life. Children living in poverty who aspire to college face the same daunting admissions arms race, as well as the burden of competing for scholarships, with less support than their privileged peers. Even those not bound for college are ground down by the constant measurement in schools under pressure to push through mountains of rote, impersonal material as early as preschool.'b'Yet instead of empowering them to thrive, this drive for success is eroding children\xe2\x80\x99s health and undermining their potential. Modern education is actually making them sick.'b'Nearly 'b'one in three'b' teenagers told the American Psychological Association that stress drove them to sadness or depression \xe2\x80\x94 and their single biggest source of stress was school. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a 'b'vast majority'b' of American teenagers get at least two hours less sleep each night than recommended \xe2\x80\x94 and 'b'research'b' shows the more homework they do, the fewer hours they sleep. At the university level, 94 percent of college counseling directors in a 'b'survey'b' from last year said they were seeing rising numbers of students with severe psychological problems.'b'At the other end of the age spectrum, doctors increasingly see children in early elementary school suffering from migraine headaches and ulcers. Many physicians see a clear connection to performance pressure.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m talking about 5-, 6-, 7-year-olds who are coming in with these conditions. We never used to see that,\xe2\x80\x9d says Lawrence Rosen, a New Jersey pediatrician who works with pediatric associations nationally. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hearing this from my colleagues everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What sets Irvington apart in a nation of unhealthy schools is that educators, parents and students there have chosen to start making a change. Teachers are re-examining their homework demands, in some cases reviving the school district\xe2\x80\x99s forgotten homework guideline \xe2\x80\x94 no more than 20 minutes per class per night, and none on weekends. In fact, 'b'research'b' supports limits on homework. Students have started a task force to promote healthy habits and balanced schedules. And for the past two years, school counselors have met one on one with every student at registration time to guide them toward a manageable course load.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are sitting on a ticking time bomb,\xe2\x80\x9d said one Irvington teacher, who has seen the problem worsen over her 16 years on the job.'b'A growing body of medical evidence suggests that long-term childhood stress is linked not only with a higher risk of adult depression and anxiety, but with poor physical health outcomes, as well. The 'b'ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) Study'b', a continuing project of the Centers for Disease Control and Kaiser Permanente, shows that children who experience multiple traumas \xe2\x80\x94 including violence, abuse or a parent\xe2\x80\x99s struggle with mental illness \xe2\x80\x94 are more likely than others to suffer heart disease, lung disease, cancer and shortened life spans as adults. Those are extreme hardships but a 'b'survey of the existing science'b' in the 2013 Annual Review of Public Health suggested that the persistence of less severe stressors could similarly act as a prescription for sickness.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany of the health effects are apparent now, but many more will echo through the lives of our children,\xe2\x80\x9d says Richard Scheffler, a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will all pay the cost of treating them and suffer the loss of their productive contributions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Paradoxically, the pressure cooker is hurting, not helping, our kids\xe2\x80\x99 prospects for success. Many college students struggle with critical thinking, a fact that hasn\xe2\x80\x99t escaped their professors, only 14 percent of whom 'b'believe'b' that their students are prepared for college work, according to a 2015 report. Just 29 percent of employers in the same study reported that graduates were equipped to succeed in today\xe2\x80\x99s workplace. Both of those numbers have plummeted since 2004.'b'Contrary to a commonly voiced fear that easing pressure will lead to poorer performance, Saint Louis medical school students\xe2\x80\x99 scores on the medical boards exams have actually gone up since the stress reduction strategy was put in place.'b'At Irvington, it\xe2\x80\x99s too early to gauge the impact of new reforms, but educators see promising signs. Calls to school counselors to help students having emotional episodes in class have dropped from routine to nearly nonexistent. The A.P. class failure rate dropped by half. Irvington students continue to be accepted at respected colleges.'b'There are lessons to be learned from Irvington\xe2\x80\x99s lead. Working together, parents, educators and students can make small but important changes: instituting everyday homework limits and weekend and holiday homework bans, adding advisory periods for student support and providing students opportunities to show their growth in creative ways beyond conventional tests. Communities across the country \xe2\x80\x94 like Gaithersburg, Md., Cadiz, Ky., and New York City \xe2\x80\x94 are already taking some of these steps. In place of the race for credentials, local teams are working to cultivate deep learning, integrity, purpose and personal connection. In place of high-stakes childhoods, they are choosing health.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 THE first time it happens is a dark winter\xe2\x80\x99s afternoon, not quite a year after her death. I\xe2\x80\x99m at my desk working, and there it suddenly is: sharp, glassy-green, with that faint, musky undertone that catches at the back of your throat.'b'I recognize it instantly: the scent that hung in our hall every time she came to supper. The perfume that clung to her coat, her scarves, detectable sometimes for hours on my babies\xe2\x80\x99 hair after she\xe2\x80\x99d been carrying and kissing them.'b'That first time, it\xe2\x80\x99s a shock. Her perfume is something I\xe2\x80\x99ve long forgotten (in her final months, mostly bedridden, she was beyond all that). But here it is \xe2\x80\x94 absolute and definite and quite overpowering. It lasts for three, maybe four minutes, long enough for me to get up and start searching the room for its source (my daughter, Chlo\xc3\xab, has a few of her cardigans \xe2\x80\x94 did she leave one in here?).'b'Then, just as suddenly, it\xe2\x80\x99s gone.'b'When I tell Chlo\xc3\xab (who says that the cardigans have long since lost their scent), she rolls her eyes. \xe2\x80\x9cOh my God, now you\xe2\x80\x99re smelling dead people!\xe2\x80\x9d We laugh \xe2\x80\x94 and I soon forget about it.'b'Helen was my mother-in-law. She lived a happy, active life, but in her mid-80s her health and brain began to fail. After a couple of years of hip replacements and minor strokes, she died one warm April evening with her family all around her. As deaths go, it was probably a good one.'b'But in the weeks and months that followed, I was surprised at how often I\xe2\x80\x99d find myself poleaxed by grief at the sheer fact of her absence.'b'Helen was in her 60s when I met her, a recent widow. A willowy blonde in an elegant camel-hair coat, she was a dead ringer for Lauren Bacall (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat nonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d she\xe2\x80\x99d protest if someone said so, her eyes lighting up all the same). She was shy, but always well read, groomed and immaculate in her habits (and a tad judgmental about those who weren\xe2\x80\x99t).'b'On our first meeting, waiting while her son \xe2\x80\x94 my new boyfriend \xe2\x80\x94 parked the car, she asked if I agreed that his recent attempt at a beard made him look like a used-car salesman. I burst out laughing and that comment set the tone for our whole relationship.'b'Helen was my ally, my champion (frequently even against her son, Jonathan).

I don\xe2\x80\x99t think so.'b'What I do believe in \xe2\x80\x94 am perpetually fascinated by \xe2\x80\x94 is the gulf between what humans are capable of imagining and what may actually be there.'b'I tell Mike that even if I did believe in ghosts, it would be extremely uncharacteristic of Helen to haunt me like this. It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much that she was resolutely rationalist (though she was), more that she\xe2\x80\x99d be embarrassed to come back in this demonstrative fashion.'b'Later, I Google \xe2\x80\x9csmelling perfume of dead person\xe2\x80\x9d and find an excerpt from a book about \xe2\x80\x9cafter-death communication\xe2\x80\x9d by an American academic and self-styled skeptic named Sylvia Hart Wright. She claims there is convincing research on the subject and cites the example of her late husband who, after his death, appeared to make frequent contact by turning electrical appliances on and off.'b'I email her to ask if she can account for my experiences. She writes back to say that my episodes are \xe2\x80\x9cperfect examples of a common phenomenon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy gut feeling,\xe2\x80\x9d her email concludes, \xe2\x80\x9cis that when you smell your mother-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s perfume, her spirit is visiting you in some fashion, trying to communicate to you her continuing closeness and support.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A nice idea. I wish I could say that my own gut feeling supported it.'b'Next, I email Jay A. Gottfried, a neuroscientist who runs the Gottfried Laboratory at Northwestern University, which investigates the links between brain activity and sensory perception.'b'Professor Gottfried tells me that what I describe is known in his business as \xe2\x80\x9cphantosmia\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cphantom smells.\xe2\x80\x9d The sense of smell, he says, is our most ancient, primal sense and has \xe2\x80\x9cintimate and direct control over emotional and behavioral states.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is especially true for personal, meaningful memories that tend to get stamped into our brains very robustly,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cThus it is possible that a seemingly random trigger or thought \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps even outside your conscious awareness \xe2\x80\x94 has triggered some aspect of your mother-in-law memory.\xe2\x80\x9d In some ways, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cit is true that your mother-in-law is \xe2\x80\x98visiting\xe2\x80\x99 you, to the extent that your memory of her is strong, and that the vividness of her perfume makes it seem like she is there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I read that last sentence several times over. It seems reasonable. But could it explain so many episodes? And what about the persistence of the perfume, lingering often for minutes at a time: Can a triggered memory \xe2\x80\x94 a random sensory \xe2\x80\x9cthread,\xe2\x80\x9d in his words, snagged from the \xe2\x80\x9cpatchwork\xe2\x80\x9d of the unconscious \xe2\x80\x94 do that?'b'I put all of this to him in a carefully concise email, and then add \xe2\x80\x94 because I can\xe2\x80\x99t resist it \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI would just love to know: Have you ever, as a scientist, experienced something you feel you can\xe2\x80\x99t explain?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t reply.'b'I decide to try another branch of science.'b'FLORIAN Ruths is a consultant psychiatrist at London\xe2\x80\x99s Maudsley Hospital. I know Dr. Ruths from attending a course he taught a few years ago. I am slightly embarrassed to approach him with such an eccentric-seeming inquiry, but Dr. Ruths\xe2\x80\x99s reply is affable and serious.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA sensory experience without an appropriate stimulus,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains, \xe2\x80\x9cis called a hallucination,\xe2\x80\x9d and these are \xe2\x80\x9cnot unusual in grief reactions.\xe2\x80\x9d In less clinical terms, he tells me I \xe2\x80\x9chave been given a wonderful sensory memory cue that brings back your beloved mother-in-law in such an immediate and emotionally charged manner.\xe2\x80\x9d Maybe, he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a very wise trick of your brain of maintaining such a fond memory of her, and an emotional connection to her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The idea of a \xe2\x80\x9cwise trick\xe2\x80\x9d of the brain is a seductive one. But the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cgrief reactions\xe2\x80\x9d bothers me. I did grieve when Helen died, very much so, and for several months. But after five years?'b'If this \xe2\x80\x9cgrief\xe2\x80\x9d now takes any shape, it\xe2\x80\x99s a simple longing to see her again. How wonderful it would be to call her, hear her pick up the phone, shyly pleased, and to go over and sit on her terrace, drink a glass of sauvignon blanc and watch the boats slide past on the Thames, as we used to.'b'I recognize this for what it is: a natural nostalgia for the days when our children were small, when life seemed so uncomplicated, when so much still lay ahead.'b'But if this is just about my own, unrequited longing, then \xe2\x80\x94 Mike might ask \xe2\x80\x94 who exactly is the ghost? Could this be a case of the living haunting the dead, rather than vice versa?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not a churchgoer or even strictly a believer, but realizing that I\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed no possibility of a religious context for these experiences, I email my friend Giles Goddard, who is an Anglican vicar. He tells me he\xe2\x80\x99s certain that \xe2\x80\x9cstrange and inexplicable things\xe2\x80\x9d are regularly \xe2\x80\x9cperceived by the subconscious often with no obvious cause.\xe2\x80\x9d Like Dr. Ruths, he suggests it\xe2\x80\x99s a normal part of grieving. He sends me a verse by Gerard Manley Hopkins:'b''b'All things counter, original, spare, strange;'b''b''b'Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)'b''b''b'With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;'b''b''b'He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:'b''b''b'Praise him.'b''b'Original, spare and strange, I like that. But I still find it hard to believe that this is a response to grief. Why would it suddenly come back at me like this?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe grief is the wrong word, then,\xe2\x80\x9d he counters. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe loss?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Loss. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t that the hardest lesson of human existence? The finality of losing someone you love, of having them fall right out of your life forever: the cold and terrible permanence of it.'b'Intellectually, I comprehend that Helen is dead. But even after all this time, I\xe2\x80\x99m still not sure I believe it.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been weeks since I smelled the scent. Whenever I haven\xe2\x80\x99t smelled it for a while, I begin to think it won\xe2\x80\x99t come again. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I feel about that.'b'The other day, killing time on a rainy autumn afternoon on Oxford Street, I walked into a department store and, on a whim, went to the Est\xc3\xa9e Lauder counter. The sales assistant asked if I\xe2\x80\x99d like to try the new perfume. I smiled and shook my head, picking up one bottle after another \xe2\x80\x94 with names like Beautiful, Youth-Dew, Pleasures \xe2\x80\x94 and sniffing at them.'b'I sprayed White Linen onto a card. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t far off: clean and citrusy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a gift for someone?\xe2\x80\x9d the girl asked.'b'I hesitated. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m trying to find the one my mother-in-law wears.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sensing a sale, her eyes brightened.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t remember?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t ask her?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot really.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a surprise, then?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I smiled. \xe2\x80\x9cKind of.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that\xe2\x80\x99s the one?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WHEN I was a child, my parents would take me to visit stately homes. I grew up in a part of England that seemed to be filled with them \xe2\x80\x94 Tudor mansions, pseudo-Palladian villas, Gothic piles \xe2\x80\x94 and whole Sundays would be spent walking along their corridors or exploring knot gardens with a host of people I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know.'b'Most belonged to the National Trust, which allotted a few rooms to the original owners, shadowy figures who would drift through the old kitchens, transformed into tearooms, gracing us with their presence. I used to wonder what it must be like to live in a house where one room led into another in infinite sequence, a house so cold I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it warm.'b'Some rooms were lined with leather, others had hand-painted wallpaper or tapestries made in French workshops by nimble-fingered Huguenots. And canvases everywhere \xe2\x80\x94 landscapes, portraits, mythological erotica \xe2\x80\x94 acquired on the Grand Tour, all of them hung too high to be seen. But that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their function; they weren\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to be seen, but to be admired, and envied, as 'b'value'b'.'b'Was it envy that drove us there, in our utilitarian cars and tourist coaches, or something more noble? As a child, I looked forward to the visits. I imagined myself as master of the house, running from room to room, enjoying the gilded splendor of it all.'b'Some years later, as a teenage Maoist, I regarded these bloated houses and their enormous parks as emblematic of pre-capitalist injustice, etc., and would happily have bulldozed them into the ground, along with their putative owners. Even No\xc3\xabl Coward, hardly a dyed-in-the-wool revolutionary, saw them as symbols of classist oppression:'b''b'The Stately Homes of England, 'b''b''b'How beautiful they stand,'b''b''b'To prove the upper classes 'b''b''b'Have still the upper hand.'b''b'Forty years on, and the houses are still here. They\xe2\x80\x99re part of our heritage, we\xe2\x80\x99re told, passed down from one generation to the next, repositories of value \xe2\x80\x94 that word again \xe2\x80\x94 and no one seems to notice that most of us are nothing more than paying guests at the servants\xe2\x80\x99 door.'b'People talk of the stately home as a microcosm of an entire shared past, but what\xe2\x80\x99s striking about them is that no one in them actually 'b'makes'b' anything. The money it all requires to survive, like ripeness, simply falls from the air. The dirty business, the satanic mills, the slave plantations, the opium trade, the place of excrement in which the mansion has been pitched, to misuse a phrase of Yeats, is hidden away. The only reminder is the way the word \xe2\x80\x9cheritage\xe2\x80\x9d collocates so easily with \xe2\x80\x9cindustry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The author Julian Fellowes\xe2\x80\x99s first stab at the English aristocracy was the Robert Altman film \xe2\x80\x9cGosford Park'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' It\xe2\x80\x99s an acerbic look at country-house life, and the primary victims of its genteel sarcasm are the idle rich, even if they do get the best lines. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to forget Maggie Smith\xe2\x80\x99s delivery of the words \xe2\x80\x9cbought marmalade,\xe2\x80\x9d as though she\xe2\x80\x99d been offered a bowl of sheep\xe2\x80\x99s eyes to go with her Tanqueray and T. Not that the staff escapes unscathed. Snobbery is the proud cement that binds the two mutually dependent worlds together.'b'On the surface, \xe2\x80\x9cDownton Abbey,\xe2\x80\x9d whose final season begins in the United States tonight, is more of the same. Mr. Fellowes revisits some familiar antitheses \xe2\x80\x94 money vs. class, upstairs vs. downstairs, gainful employment (bad) vs. unearned income (good) \xe2\x80\x94 but in a markedly less critical key. Even the Maggie Smith character loses some of her caustic edge. The shark-tank atmosphere of the film is replaced by something that isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite Vaseline on the lens, but whose arriviste sheen blurs the vision almost as much. The rich will always be with us is the essential message, however bankrupt or indebted or criminally incompetent they may be, and we\xe2\x80\x99d better get used to it.'b'With due respect to the artistic abyss between the two, Mr. Fellowes\xe2\x80\x99s classy period soap reminds me of \xe2\x80\x9cBrideshead Revisited.\xe2\x80\x9d Evelyn Waugh\xe2\x80\x99s stand-in narrator, Charles Ryder, is as dazzled by the aristocracy as Mr. Fellowes seems to be, as reluctant to admit that the kind of social stratification the house represents might not actually be worth preserving. Waugh\xe2\x80\x99s famous regret, that \xe2\x80\x9cBrideshead\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cinfused with a kind of gluttony,\xe2\x80\x9d is partial recognition of his own bulimic nostalgia. \xe2\x80\x9cDownton,\xe2\x80\x9d though, pretends egalitarianism isn\xe2\x80\x99t even a threat, just as long as holes are punched in the box of class privilege to let in a little air.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what Waugh thought of the National Trust, although I can imagine him wrinkling his nose at the tea towels and fridge magnets and \xe2\x80\x9chomemade\xe2\x80\x9d marmalade that fill the gift shops annexed to most large houses, the Keep Calm mugs and the tawdry wistfulness of it all, a wistfulness reinforced by \xe2\x80\x9cDownton Abbey.\xe2\x80\x9d But one of the comforting lies we tell ourselves, in a world where the most important ladder is the property ladder, is that by calling these hallowed halls, these echoing corridors of privilege and entitlement, our 'b'heritage'b', we somehow make them ours.'b'This election season offers an opportunity to reframe the debate over Social Security. It is necessary, of course, to ensure the program\xe2\x80\x99s long-term health beyond 2034, when the system is projected to come up short. But this can\xe2\x80\x99t be done by broadly cutting benefits. In fact, there\xe2\x80\x99s mounting evidence that Social Security, which has become ever more important in retirement, needs to be expanded.'b'Currently, 36 percent of retirees rely on Social Security for 90 percent or more of their income; over all, 65 percent of retirees rely on it for more than half of their income. The average monthly benefit hovers around $1,300. Retirement security won\xe2\x80\x99t be any better for those now in their 50s. The Government Accountability Office 'b'recently found'b' that 52 percent of American households with someone 55 or older have nothing saved for retirement and that only half of that 52 percent will get anything from a company pension. For those ages 55 to 64 with retirement savings, the median amount is barely in the six figures.'b'Younger workers are arguably worse off, because saving has become increasingly difficult, or impossible, in the face of stagnating wages, high debt, high rents and the lack of employer-provided retirement benefits. In 2013, 44 percent of workers on the lower half of the income scale had a retirement plan at work, down from 54 percent in 1995, according to 'b'data'b' from the Federal Reserve.'b'Despite these facts, nearly all Republican candidates have called for cuts to Social Security benefits.'b'Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio all favor cutting benefits by delaying the age for full benefits; the retirement age is already set to rise to 67 for people born in 1960 or later. They say a higher retirement age is needed to keep up with longer lives. But 'b'data show'b' that life expectancy is growing faster among the wealthy than among the poor, and poor women are seeing life expectancy decline. So raising the retirement age across the board would hit lower-income workers the hardest.'b'Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie and Mr. Cruz have also endorsed reducing future cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security, even though there is 'b'no compelling evidence'b' that the current adjustment is too high.'b'Mr. Bush and Mr. Cruz have said that Social Security payroll taxes should be diverted into new private accounts for employees, a reprise of President George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s failed privatization attempt in 2005. Private accounts do not enhance retirement security. They divert money that would otherwise finance Social Security to Wall Street and shift the risk from government to individuals.'b'Donald Trump opposes benefit cuts, including a higher retirement age, but he has offered no meaningful ideas for reform.'b'The Democratic candidates have played defense and offense. They have opposed benefit cuts and privatization. They have proposed increasing the system\xe2\x80\x99s revenues by raising the ceiling on the amount of wages, currently $118,500, that are subject to payroll taxes. That reform is overdue. If the wage ceiling had kept pace with the income gains of high earners over the decades, it would be about $250,000 today.'b'More important, they have stressed that an aim of reform is to bolster the system, not shrink it. Hillary Clinton would raise benefits for widows and for retirees who had long absences from the work force to care for relatives. Bernie Sanders and Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley would increase benefits more broadly, especially for low-income recipients.'b'Ultimately, strengthening Social Security requires a growing and healthy economy. The Democratic candidates have credible ideas for creating jobs and raising wages that would revitalize the tax base for Social Security. Those and other sensible fixes, not deep and broad cutbacks, will ensure that the system continues to provide a basic level of guaranteed retirement income for all workers.'b'MATH was never my strongest subject, so maybe I\xe2\x80\x99m just not crunching the numbers right.'b'But the more I stare at them, the less sense Marco Rubio makes.'b'Rubio as the front-runner, I mean. As the probable Republican nominee.'b'According to odds makers and prediction markets, he\xe2\x80\x99s the best bet. According to many commentators, too.'b'But Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s less than a month away, and in two recent polls of Republican voters there, he\xe2\x80\x99s a distant third, far behind Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.'b'So he\xe2\x80\x99s killing it in New Hampshire, right?'b'Wrong. A survey from two weeks ago had him second to Trump there, but another, just days earlier, put him in third place \xe2\x80\x94 after Trump and Cruz, again. Chris Christie\xe2\x80\x99s inching up on him, the reasons for which were abundantly clear in 'b'a comparison'b' of Christie\xe2\x80\x99s freewheeling campaign style and Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-controlled one by The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Michael Barbaro.'b'And as of Thursday, the Real Clear Politics average of recent polls in South Carolina showed Rubio to be more than six points behind Cruz and 21 behind Trump among that state\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans. There\xe2\x80\x99s no inkling of a surge, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if pro-Rubio forces have been holding off on advertising that will turn the tide. 'b'Plenty of ads'b' have already run.'b'In fact the rap on Rubio is that he counts too much on them and spends 'b'too little time'b' on the trail. The largest newspaper in New Hampshire took aim at the infrequency of his appearances there in 'b'an editorial'b' with the headline: \xe2\x80\x9cMarco? Marco? Where\xe2\x80\x99s Rubio?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And when he missed a Senate vote last month, a spokesman for Cruz tweeted that it was because \xe2\x80\x9che had 1 event in a row in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 a record-setting breakneck pace for Marco.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rubio can\xe2\x80\x99t claim a singularly formidable campaign organization, with a remarkably robust platoon of ground troops. His fund-raising hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been exceptional.'b'His promise seems to lie instead in his biography as the son of hard-working Cuban immigrants, in his good looks, in the polish of his oratory, in the nimbleness with which he debates.'b'And in this: Reasonable people can\xe2\x80\x99t stomach the thought of Trump or Cruz as the nominee. We can\xe2\x80\x99t accept what that would say about America, or what that could mean for it. Rubio is the flawed, rickety lifeboat we cling to, the amulet we clutch. He\xe2\x80\x99ll prevail because he must. The alternative is simply too perverse (Trump) or too cruel (Cruz).'b'But so much about him and the contention that he\xe2\x80\x99s poised for victory is puzzling.'b'Because this is his first national campaign, reporters (and opponents) are digging into his past more vigorously than ever, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how much fodder it holds and how much defense he\xe2\x80\x99ll have to play.'b'Just last week, The Washington Post 'b'reported'b' that in 2002, when he was the majority whip in the Florida House of Representatives, he used statehouse stationery to write a letter in support of a real estate license for his sister\xe2\x80\x99s husband, who had served 12 years in federal prison for distributing $15 million worth of cocaine.'b'Rubio, 44, is only now coming into focus.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s frequently been called the Republican Obama \xe2\x80\x94 because he\xe2\x80\x99s young, a trailblazing minority and a serious presidential contender while still a first-term senator.'b'But a prominent G.O.P. strategist told me that Rubio reminds him more of another Democratic president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the Republican Bill Clinton,\xe2\x80\x9d the strategist said, referring to the slickness with which Rubio shifts shapes and the confidence with which he straddles ideological divides.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s a conservative crusader, happy to carry the banner of the Tea Party. He\xe2\x80\x99s a coolheaded pragmatist, ready to do the bidding of Wall Street donors.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRubio is triangulating,\xe2\x80\x9d Eleanor Clift 'b'wrote recently'b', choosing a Clintonian verb to describe his fuzzy, evolving positions.'b'He pushed for a comprehensive immigration-reform bill, including a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, until he suddenly stepped away from it. He has said that he opposes abortion even in cases of rape or incest, but he has also said that he\xe2\x80\x99d back less extreme regulations if they were the only attainable ones.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRubio\xe2\x80\x99s inclusiveness can invite caricature,\xe2\x80\x9d Evan Osnos observed 'b'in The New Yorker'b' in late November. \xe2\x80\x9cHe considers himself a Catholic, but he attends two churches \xe2\x80\x94 an evangelical Protestant service on Saturdays and a Roman Catholic Mass on Sundays.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s a pile of paradoxes. He\xe2\x80\x99s a teetering stack of them.'b'By dint of his heritage, he\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to represent a much-needed Republican bridge to Latinos. But many of his positions impede that, and several recent polls raise doubts about the strength of his appeal to Latino voters.'b'THERE\xe2\x80\x99S no theme in his campaign more incessantly trumpeted than a generational one. Declaiming that Hillary Clinton, 68, is yesterday, he presents himself as tomorrow, an ambassador for young voters who\xe2\x80\x99ll presumably bring more of them, too, to the Republican camp.'b'But in a Washington Post/ABC News poll in late November, his support was more than twice as strong among Republican voters 65 and older as among those under 50.'b'And he\xe2\x80\x99s at sharp odds with millennials on a range of issues. Most of them favor same-sex marriage; he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. Most are wary of government surveillance; he\xe2\x80\x99s one of its fiercest proponents. Unlike him, they want 'b'marijuana legalized'b'. Unlike him, they want 'b'decisive government action'b' against climate change.'b'And they\xe2\x80\x99re not swayed by unwrinkled skin and a relatively full head of dark hair. Just ask wizened, white-tufted Bernie Sanders, 74, whose campaign is the one most clearly buoyed by young voters.'b'So what does Rubio offer them?'b'He communicates a message \xe2\x80\x94 a gleam \xe2\x80\x94 of hope. He\xe2\x80\x99s a smoother salesman and more talented politician than most of his Republican rivals. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I still buy the argument that he\xe2\x80\x99s the one to watch, especially given his party\xe2\x80\x99s long history of selecting less provocative candidates over firebrands.'b'I still nod at the notion that if he merely finishes ahead of Christie, Jeb Bush and other candidates who are vying for mainstream Republicans in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, they\xe2\x80\x99ll fade, their supporters will flock to him and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be lifted above Cruz and even above Trump, who could implode at any moment anyway.'b'But over the last three decades, no Republican or Democrat \xe2\x80\x94 with the exception of Bill Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 lost both Iowa and New Hampshire and survived that crisis in momentum to win the nomination. If that\xe2\x80\x99s Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s path, it\xe2\x80\x99s an unusual one.'b'In an unusual year, yes. But as the wait for his candidacy to heat up lengthens, I wonder: Could he burn out before he ever catches fire?'b'WHEN I moved my Beginning Greek course, last year, from the spring to fall semester, I did not reckon with the impact on my psyche of diminishing daylight. As the days grew shorter, my thoughts about the course grew darker. When the semester concluded, just before the winter solstice, those thoughts had also reached a nadir, giving way to the fear that I had failed, once again, in my 30-year quest to turn bright and eager undergraduates into readers, and lovers, of ancient Greek.'b'Sisyphus would sympathize with my condition. Every year I begin rolling my stone up a four-month-long hill, my hopes high. Every year I end up far closer to the bottom than the top. Some of my students still, after 120 hours of instruction, take the first noun in a sentence as its subject, no matter what form it\xe2\x80\x99s in. Their habits of 15 years of reading English will not give way to the methodology that an ancient language demands.'b'Reading Greek (or Latin) depends, first and foremost, on recognition of case endings. A student must develop an instinct for seeing the word \xe2\x80\x9canthr\xc5\x8dpou\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c'b'of'b' a man,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9canthr\xc5\x8dpois\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cfor men,\xe2\x80\x9d and similarly with eight other forms of the same word. To look for meaning rather than case, to see only \xe2\x80\x9cman\xe2\x80\x9d in either word, is what readers of English are programmed to do. My task, as a teacher, is to defeat this impulse. The experience of reading without reference to word order, once students \xe2\x80\x9cget it,\xe2\x80\x9d can be exhilarating, like being freed from a kind of gravity.'b'But for reasons I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, some take far longer than others to \xe2\x80\x9cget it,\xe2\x80\x9d and a few never will. Lack of intelligence isn\xe2\x80\x99t the problem; it\xe2\x80\x99s more about adaptability, acceptance of change. How long should such students go on in the language, hoping for an epiphany? Should I encourage them to continue? And if I do, is it only to assuage my own sense of failure?'b'Paradoxically, the mood in my classroom brightened as the days grew darker. I counterweighted my own internal gloom with saturnalian energy and verve. Anecdotes and digressions proliferated, sometimes drawing boisterous laughter. But the levity masked a sense of unease, a fear that standards were not being met. The number of sentences that couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be cracked, or even attempted, had grown; whole pages of the workbook stood blank. The day of reckoning loomed \xe2\x80\x94 the final exam.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s at such times that Professor de Breeze swims into my thoughts. He\xe2\x80\x99s one of the useless, blinkered obsessives who populate the nihilistic landscape of Dr. Seuss\xe2\x80\x99s darkest exploration of human folly, \xe2\x80\x9cDid I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?'b'\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'The anapests that describe him run through my mind on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis:'b''b'How fortunate you\xe2\x80\x99re not Professor de Breeze'b''b''b'Who has spent the past thirty-two years, if you please,'b''b''b'Trying to teach Irish ducks how to read Jivanese.'b''b'Am 'b'I'b' Professor de Breeze? The span of my teaching career is rapidly approaching his. Of the scores of students to whom I have taught Beginning Greek, only a small minority learned to read it with real comprehension, and of those, only a handful still do. What did I contribute to the others, except the most laborious eight credits they ever earned?'b'Oblivious to my struggles, the textbook tries, every year, to crown my students\xe2\x80\x99 achievements by offering them long passages from Sophocles, Homer and Plato. I assigned, for last term\xe2\x80\x99s final exam, a reading from \xe2\x80\x9cAntigone\xe2\x80\x9d that contains one of my favorite Sophoclean lines: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a warm heart for cold things,\xe2\x80\x9d says the cautious Ismene to her sister Antigone, to dissuade her from defying state decrees and burying their brother. I contemplated the satisfaction my class would get from translating this verse, which seemed to offer little difficulty, apart from the separation of \xe2\x80\x9cheart\xe2\x80\x9d from its modifier \xe2\x80\x9cwarm.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As I graded the exams, however, I found Professor de Breeze once again looking over my shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a warm heart because of the cold,\xe2\x80\x9d read one version; \xe2\x80\x9cyou have a warm heart in addition to a cold one,\xe2\x80\x9d ran another (several variants on this theme). One ingenious student came close with \xe2\x80\x9cYou have a warm heart for cold men\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a possible meaning, though it makes Antigone\xe2\x80\x99s care for her brother\xe2\x80\x99s corpse sound like necrophilia. Two out of my 10 students had understood the line. Wearily I uncapped my red pen, my sins lying heavy upon me.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been said that, for nonstellar teachers at least, the hardest things to teach are the things one loves most. When I tried, years ago, to read \xe2\x80\x9cKing Lear\xe2\x80\x9d with a group of indifferent freshmen, I made a complete botch of things; my investment in their seeing the play as I did was too great. The same feeling afflicts me on a daily basis when teaching Greek, though I have learned better how to suppress it. \xe2\x80\x9cI will be the pattern of all patience,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lear when his daughters disappointed him, and I have long wanted to emblazon that line over the door of my classroom. No one in that room, I must remind myself, will \xe2\x80\x9chear\xe2\x80\x9d the Antigone passage as I want them to, at least not without lots of help. I must have a cold heart for warm things.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOimoi katauda,\xe2\x80\x9d Antigone screams \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cShout it to the skies!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 when Ismene urges her to keep her plan secret. That \xe2\x80\x9coimoi,\xe2\x80\x9d a cry of pain both mocking and sincere, gives vivid insight into Antigone\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind; lines like this are the best argument one can find for learning Greek. It\xe2\x80\x99s untranslatable, yet translate we must. Our textbook offers either \xe2\x80\x9cAlas\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwoe is me,\xe2\x80\x9d and there\xe2\x80\x99s little to choose between the two.

Most, at least, had recognized it as an imperative form.'b'With that cry of pain, the exam, and the semester, had ended. Antigone was doomed to die, but at least had managed to spread a little dust on her brother\xe2\x80\x99s corpse. In Beginning Greek, too, one settles for small victories and accepts huge shortfalls. But giving up is not an option.'b'As I finished grading, word arrived of the results of spring registration. Eight of my 10 students had chosen to go on to next semester\xe2\x80\x99s Greek course. The news, I was surprised to find, made me unreservedly happy.'b'The solstice had passed, and the days were already brightening.'b'DO some people have a special talent for serendipity? And if so, why?'b'In 2008, an inventor named Steve Hollinger lobbed a digital camera across his studio toward a pile of pillows. \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to make an invention,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just playing.\xe2\x80\x9d As his camera flew, it recorded what most of us would call a bad photo. But when Mr. Hollinger peered at that blurry image, he saw new possibilities. Soon, he was building a throwable videocamera in the shape of a baseball, equipped with gyroscopes and sensors. The Squito (as he named it) could be rolled into a crawlspace or thrown across a river \xe2\x80\x94 providing a record of the world from all kinds of \xe2\x80\x9cnonhuman\xe2\x80\x9d perspectives. Today, Mr. Hollinger holds six patents related to throwable cameras.'b'A surprising number of the conveniences of modern life were invented when someone stumbled upon a discovery or capitalized on an accident: the microwave oven, safety glass, smoke detectors, artificial sweeteners, X-ray imaging. Many blockbuster drugs of the 20th century emerged because a lab worker picked up on the \xe2\x80\x9cwrong\xe2\x80\x9d information.'b'While researching breakthroughs like these, I began to wonder whether we can train ourselves to become more serendipitous. How do we cultivate the art of finding what we\xe2\x80\x99re not seeking?'b'For decades, a University of Missouri information scientist named Sanda Erdelez has been asking that question. Growing up in Croatia, she developed a passion for losing herself in piles of books and yellowed manuscripts, hoping to be surprised. Dr. Erdelez told me that Croatian has no word to capture the thrill of the unexpected discovery, so she was delighted when \xe2\x80\x94 after moving to the United States on a Fulbright scholarship in the 1980s \xe2\x80\x94 she learned the English word \xe2\x80\x9cserendipity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today we think of serendipity as something like dumb luck. But its original meaning was very different.'b'In 1754, a belle-lettrist named Horace Walpole retreated to a desk in his gaudy castle in Twickenham, in southwest London, and penned a letter. Walpole had been entranced by a Persian fairy tale about three princes from the Isle of Serendip who possess superpowers of observation. In his letter, Walpole suggested that this old tale contained a crucial idea about human genius: \xe2\x80\x9cAs their highnesses travelled, they were always making discoveries, by accident and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of.\xe2\x80\x9d And he proposed a new word \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cserendipity\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to describe this princely talent for detective work. At its birth, serendipity meant a skill rather than a random stroke of good fortune.'b'Dr. Erdelez agrees with that definition. She sees serendipity as something people 'b'do'b'. In the mid-1990s, she began a study of about 100 people to find out how they created their own serendipity, or failed to do so.'b'Her qualitative data \xe2\x80\x94 from surveys and interviews \xe2\x80\x94 showed that the subjects fell into three distinct groups. Some she called \xe2\x80\x9cnon-encounterers\xe2\x80\x9d; they saw through a tight focus, a kind of chink hole, and they tended to stick to their to-do lists when searching for information rather than wandering off into the margins. Other people were \xe2\x80\x9coccasional encounterers,\xe2\x80\x9d who stumbled into moments of serendipity now and then. Most interesting were the \xe2\x80\x9csuper-encounterers,\xe2\x80\x9d who reported that happy surprises popped up wherever they looked. The super-encounterers loved to spend an afternoon hunting through, say, a Victorian journal on cattle breeding, in part, because they counted on finding treasures in the oddest places. In fact, they were so addicted to prospecting that they would find information for friends and colleagues.'b'You become a super-encounterer, according to Dr. Erdelez, in part because you believe that you are one \xe2\x80\x94 it helps to assume that you possess special powers of perception, like an invisible set of antennas, that will lead you to clues.'b'A few months ago, I was having a drink in Cambridge, Mass., with a friend, a talented journalist who was piecing together a portrait of a secretive Wall Street wizard. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t found the real story yet; I\xe2\x80\x99m still gathering string,\xe2\x80\x9d my friend told me, invoking an old newsroom term to describe the first stage of reporting, when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for something that you can\xe2\x80\x99t yet name. Later that night, as I walked home from the bar, I realized \xe2\x80\x9cgathering string\xe2\x80\x9d is just another way of talking about super-encountering. After all, \xe2\x80\x9cstring\xe2\x80\x9d is the stuff that accumulates in a journalist\xe2\x80\x99s pocket. It\xe2\x80\x99s the note you jot down in your car after the interview, the knickknack you notice on someone\xe2\x80\x99s shelf, or the anomaly that jumps out at you in Appendix B of an otherwise boring research study.'b'As I navigated the brick sidewalk, passing under the pinkish glow of a streetlight, I thought about how string was probably hiding all around me. A major story might lurk behind the Harvard zoology museum ahead or in the plane soaring above. String is everywhere for the taking, if you have the talent to take it.'b'In the 1960s, Gay Talese, then a young reporter, declared that \xe2\x80\x9cNew York is a city of things unnoticed\xe2\x80\x9d and delegated himself to be the one who noticed. Thus, he transformed the Isle of Manhattan into the Isle of Serendip: He traced the perambulations of feral cats, cataloged shoeshine purveyors, tracked down statistics related to the bathrooms at Yankee Stadium and discovered a colony of ants at the top of the Empire State Building. He published his findings in a little book titled \xe2\x80\x9cNew York: A Serendipiter\xe2\x80\x99s Journey'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The term \xe2\x80\x9cserendipiter\xe2\x80\x9d breathed new life into Walpole\xe2\x80\x99s word, turning serendipity into a protagonist and a practitioner. After all, those ants at the top of the Empire State Building didn\xe2\x80\x99t find themselves; Mr. Talese had to notice them, which was no easy matter. Similarly, Dr. Erdelez came up with the term super-encounterer to give us a way to talk about the 'b'people 'b'rather than just the discoveries. Without such words, we tend to become dazzled by the happy accident itself, to think of it as something that exists independent of an observer.'b'We can slip into a twisted logic in which we half-believe the penicillin picked Alexander Fleming to be its emissary, or that the moons of Jupiter wanted to be seen by Galileo. But discoveries are products of the human mind.'b'As people dredge the unknown, they are engaging in a highly creative act. What an inventor \xe2\x80\x9cfinds\xe2\x80\x9d is always an expression of him- or herself. Martin Chalfie, who won a Nobel Prize for his work connected with green fluorescent protein \xe2\x80\x94 the stuff that makes jellyfish glow green \xe2\x80\x94 told me that he and several other Nobel Prize winners benefited from a chain of accidents and chance encounters on the way to their revelations. Some scientists even embrace a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cfree jazz\xe2\x80\x9d method, he said, improvising as they go along: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of people getting good results after accidentally dropping their experimental preparations on the floor, picking them up, and working on them nonetheless,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'b'So how many big ideas emerge from spills, crashes, failed experiments and blind stabs? One survey of patent holders (the PatVal study of European inventors, published in 2005) found that an incredible 50 percent of patents resulted from what could be described as a serendipitous process. Thousands of survey respondents reported that their idea evolved when they were working on an unrelated project \xe2\x80\x94 and often when they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even trying to invent anything. This is why we need to know far more about the habits that transform a mistake into a breakthrough.'b'IN the late 1980s, Dr. John Eng, an endocrinologist, became curious about certain animal poisons that damaged the pancreas, so he ordered lizard venom through the mail and began to play around with it. As a result of this curious exercise, he discovered a new compound in the saliva of a Gila monster, and that in turn led to a treatment for diabetes. One of Dr. Eng\xe2\x80\x99s associates (quoted in a 2005 newspaper article) remarked that he was capable of seeing \xe2\x80\x9cpatterns that others don\xe2\x80\x99t see.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Is this pattern-finding ability similar to the artistic skill of a painter like Georgia O\xe2\x80\x99Keeffe? Is it related to the string-gathering prowess of Gay Talese? We still know so little about creative observation that it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to answer such questions.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why we need to develop a new, interdisciplinary field \xe2\x80\x94 call it serendipity studies \xe2\x80\x94 that can help us create a taxonomy of discoveries in the chemistry lab, the newsroom, the forest, the classroom, the particle accelerator and the hospital. By observing and documenting the many different \xe2\x80\x9cspecies\xe2\x80\x9d of super-encounterers, we might begin to understand their minds.'b'A number of pioneering scholars have already begun this work, but they seem to be doing so in their own silos and without much cross-talk. In a 2005 paper (\xe2\x80\x9cSerendipitous Insights Involving Nonhuman Primates\xe2\x80\x9d), two experts from the Washington National Primate Research Center in Seattle cataloged the chance encounters that yielded new insights from creatures like the pigtail macaque. Meanwhile, the authors of a paper titled \xe2\x80\x9cOn the Exploitation of Serendipity in Drug Discovery\xe2\x80\x9d puzzled over the reasons the 1950s and \xe2\x80\x9960s saw a bonanza of breakthroughs in psychiatric medication, and why that run of serendipity ended. And in yet another field of study, a few information scientists are trying to understand the effects of being bombarded on social media sites with countless tantalizing pieces of \xe2\x80\x9cstring.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What could these researchers discover if they came together for one big conversation?'b'Of course, even if we do organize the study of serendipity, it will always be a whimsical undertaking, given that the phenomenon is difficult to define, amazingly variable and hard to capture in data. The clues will no doubt emerge where we least expect them, perhaps in the fungi clinging to the walls of parking garages or the mating habits of bird-watchers. The journey will be maddening, but the potential insights could be profound: One day we might be able to stumble upon new and better ways of getting lost.'b'High school graduation rates are rising, but are the students ready for college and careers?'b'To the Editor: Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'As Graduation Rates Rise, a Fear Diplomas Fall Short'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Dec. 27): As a career educator I find it disheartening to see yet another article about how poorly students are prepared for college despite a rising high school graduation rate. The explanation for these contradictory outcomes has always been obvious, and yet for years we have refused to accept it. You cannot honestly raise standards without being willing to accept a lower graduation rate. Of course, as educators we strive to improve teaching strategies as we raise standards, and the ultimate, but probably unreachable, goal is to make it possible for all students to meet these standards.'b'Certainly over the long term higher standards will improve the outcomes for all students. In many states the strategy has been to raise standards and then lower passing scores on exit exams in order to maintain or even raise the graduation rate, which means that students who are unprepared for college are given diplomas. For example, in New York State, a student needs a raw score of 30 points out of a possible 86 points (35 percent correct) on the algebra Regents in order to have a passing grade of 65'b'.'b' Similar cutoff scores are used in other subject exams as well.'b'If we are truly serious about raising standards, it seems to me that we must also be willing to accept, at least for the near term, a lower graduation rate, or tiered diplomas indicating various levels of academic achievement.'b'HOWARD BRENNER'b'Woodmere, N.Y.'b'To the Editor: Your article says of high school graduation rates, \xe2\x80\x9cStill, there is no single reason these rates have increased.\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, there is. The graduation rates increased because parents and politicians demanded that they increase. Instead of improving education, states lowered standards. For example, you report that some states \xe2\x80\x9celiminated requirements that students pass exit exams to qualify for a diploma.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Does the fact that a high school diploma is now essentially meaningless cause problems for colleges, private employers and the military? Not really. Colleges have the ACT and SAT for potential entrants; Wal-Mart, our largest private employer, has its assessment test for potential employees; and the military has the Armed Forces Qualification Test for potential recruits. The only people really harmed are the marginal students who were passed on instead of helped.'b'VIC PRESUTTI'b'Dayton, Ohio'b'To the Editor: With high school graduation rates at an all-time high, the occasion would seem right for a celebration. But the value of the diplomas issued is called into question by what colleges and students themselves are saying. At community colleges, more than half of students enrolled take at least one remedial class in math, reading or writing, according to the Community College Research Center at Teachers College of Columbia University. Even students are surprised that they are allowed to graduate when they know they don\xe2\x80\x99t deserve to, as The New York Post 'b'recently reported'b'.'b'Taxpayers are entitled to know that students are receiving at least a basic education. Instead, they are told a comforting fairy tale that shortchanges all stakeholders.'b'WALT GARDNER'b'Los Angeles'b''b'The writer\xe2\x80\x99s Reality Check blog is published in Education Week.'b''b'To the Editor: A perpetually half-empty glass seems to be the dominant trope in reporting issues in education. A prominent example is your article about Berea High School in South Carolina. Instead of celebrating an increase in graduation rates, we are told that less than 10 percent of the students are deemed ready for college-level work. That negativity is based on a specious interpretation of the test data. The ACT college readiness test provides benchmarks suggesting the 'b'probability 'b'of a 'b'typical 'b'student achieving a particular grade in a 'b' typical'b' college. There is no score separating students who are college-ready from those who are not, especially when the full range of options for postsecondary education are considered.'b'The article also observes that the more dropouts retained, the greater the challenge to achieve a high rate of college-readiness. And the skills that businesses say they most want, such as collaboration, are not assessed and consequently given little attention when schools are held accountable for test scores. Such nuanced interpretations are unlikely to deter a national narrative that assumes that every student can be prepared for any four-year college or any career. Nor will it likely deter the reporting of the inevitable failure to achieve that unrealistic goal, despite laudable and more reasonable progress.'b'DAVID REINKING'b'Athens, Ga.'b''b'The writer is a professor of education at Clemson University.'b''b'To the Editor: A high school diploma, acquired by completing the required number of academic credits, might be a ticket to some level of postsecondary learning, but success as measured by \xe2\x80\x9creal world\xe2\x80\x9d productivity and economic advancement requires a foundation in the so-called soft skills of collaboration, communication, critical thinking and problem solving.'b'As your article notes, a high school student won\xe2\x80\x99t generally be taught these essential skills. That is, unless that student is enrolled in a career and technical education, or C.T.E., program. Today\xe2\x80\x99s C.T.E. is not your father\xe2\x80\x99s shop class. Rigorous academic content is integrated into up-to-the-minute technical learning, and career readiness is the foundation of the curriculum. And contrary to popular belief, many C.T.E. students do go on to college. As educational leaders continue to be frustrated by the disconnect between secondary education and meaningful preparation for success, the time is right for a closer look at the value of career and technical education.'b'EILEEN SIKORA'b'Poughkeepsie, N.Y.'b''b'The writer is associate principal of the Dutchess BOCES Career and Technical Institute.'b''b'To the Editor:Your article suggests that Berea, S.C., students are not prepared for college or career because too few of them have high ACT scores. This presumes that the ACT and SAT measure college and career readiness. What such tests primarily reflect is family income, with low-income students consistently performing worse than wealthier ones. Berea had an estimated per capita income of $15,475 in 2013 (down from $16,512 in 2000). Berea also has a higher percentage of immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 in 2013, 12.8 percent of its population was foreign-born \xe2\x80\x94 than South Carolina as a whole.'b'Not surprisingly, students who are English language learners also do not do well on standardized tests.

It is poverty and lack of economic opportunity.'b'JULIA SASS RUBIN'b'Princeton, N.J.'b''b'Th'b''b'e writer is an associate professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers University.'b''b''b'EVERY New Year\xe2\x80\x99s'b', in a spirit of self-examination, I try to catalog my worst blunders from the preceding year. But this year, like almost every pundit in America, I have one mistake that overshadows all the others, one confession that makes my other faults seem venial by comparison.'b''b'I underestimated Donald Trump.'b''b'To really make a clean breast on this issue, I have to reach back earlier than 2015 (some forecasts take more than a year to be disproven), to 'b'a column I wrote'b' in the far-off days of the 2012 campaign, when Mitt Romney flew to Vegas, baby, to accept an endorsement from the Donald.'b'This struck me, at the time, as a needless move by Mitt, because it left him sticky with the tar of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s birther nonsense while delivering little in return. The idea that Romney needed the kind of voters excited by Trump\xe2\x80\x99s flamethrower style, I wrote, confused \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of a fan base (which Trump certainly has) with the existence of a meaningful constituency (which he almost certainly does not).\xe2\x80\x9d And even if there were real Trumpistas, Romney would win their allegiance eventually: \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone who thrills to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s slashing attacks on the president probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting this election out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a third-party candidate, I went on, Trump 'b'might'b' pose some danger to Romney\xe2\x80\x99s general-election chances. But Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthird party rumblings are like his birther bluster \xe2\x80\x94 sound and fury, signifying only ego.\xe2\x80\x9d And Romney would risk little with conservatives by giving him the stiff arm. \xe2\x80\x9cTrump isn\xe2\x80\x99t Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin: His conservatism is feigned, his right-wing fans are temporary admirers with no deep commitment to his brand or cause, and hardly anyone in the conservative media is likely to rise to his defense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now, if I were the sort to engage in special pleading, I would note that this may not have been technically wrong as an analysis of the status quo in 2012. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t think Trump would have run third party if Romney had stiffed him, for instance, and I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure that right-wing talk radio wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have backed him if he had.'b'But don\xe2\x80\x99t let the technicalities fool you: I sold Trump wildly short, and his entire campaign to date has proven it.'b'First, Trump has had a very easy time turning his celebrity fan base into a meaningful constituency. Exactly how meaningful remains to be seen, but for months far more Republicans have told pollsters that they intend to vote for him than have rallied to any other banner. They may not all be Trump voters in the end, but that there is a significant Trump faction in our politics no sane observer can deny.'b'Second, that faction has turned out to include precisely the kind of voters Romney needed in 2012 and who stayed home instead: Blue-collar whites with moderate views on economics and a weak attachment to the institutional G.O.P. (So weak, 'b'a recent New York Times analysis'b' makes clear, that many are still registered Democrats.) These 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cmissing white voters\xe2\x80\x9d'b' might not have put Romney over the top, but they certainly would have helped his chances in states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan \xe2\x80\x94 all places where Trump is running strongly at the moment.'b'Third, even as he\xe2\x80\x99s wooed the disaffected and non-ideological, Trump has also won over or at least neutralized an important segment of the conservative media. He isn\xe2\x80\x99t Rush Limbaugh or Sarah Palin, sure, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve both been covering for him, as have a raft of performers who like to portray themselves as keepers of True Conservatism\xe2\x80\x99s flame. And this cover has enabled Trump \xe2\x80\x94 no True Conservative himself, to put it mildly \xe2\x80\x94 to put together an unusual coalition, a mix of hard-right and radical-center voters, that\xe2\x80\x99s unlike anything in recent politics.'b'Now if I wanted to avoid giving Trump his due, I could claim that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t underestimate him, I misread everyone else \xe2\x80\x94 from the voters supporting him despite his demagoguery to the right-wing entertainers willing to forgive his ideological deviations.'b'I certainly overestimated poor Jeb Bush, whom 'b'I wrongly predicted'b' would profit from Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rise. But for the rest \xe2\x80\x94 no, I had a pretty low opinion of the right-wing entertainment complex to begin with, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not remotely surprised that the white working class would rally to a candidate 'b'running on populist and nationalist themes'b'.'b'I am very surprised, though, that Trump himself would have the political savvy, the (relative) discipline and yes, the stamina required to exploit that opening and become that populist. And for that failure of imagination, I humbly repent.'b'Of course I\xe2\x80\x99m not completely humbled. Indeed, I\xe2\x80\x99m still proud enough to continue predicting, in defiance of national polling, that there\xe2\x80\x99s still 'b'no way'b' that Trump will actually be the 2016 Republican nominee.'b'Trust me: I\xe2\x80\x99m a pundit.'b'(And I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in the confessional next year.)'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'I WAS transported recently to a place that is as enchanting to me as any winter wonderland: my local post office.'b'In line, I thought fondly of the year I came to this country from Turkey as an adult and discovered the magic of reliable mail service. Dependable infrastructure is magical not simply because it works, but also because it allows innovation to thrive, including much of the Internet-based economy that has grown in the past decade. You can\xe2\x80\x99t have Amazon or eBay without a reliable way to get things to people\xe2\x80\x99s homes.'b'Of course, infrastructure is also boring, so we get used to it and forget what a gift it truly is. I never do, maybe because I discovered it so late.'b'My first year in the United States was full of surprises. I remember trying to figure out if the 24-ounce glass of ice water the waitress placed in front of me was a pitcher, to be shared by the whole table. But where was the spout? I had expected some of what I encountered \xe2\x80\x94 I had seen enough movies, and came to this country expecting big cars and big houses and wide open spaces. I got used to gigantic glasses.'b'But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect the post office.'b'The first time I needed to mail something, I trekked over to my campus\xe2\x80\x99s post office, looking for the line to get my envelope weighed. The staff was used to befuddled international students like me, I suppose, and one clerk took my envelope without fuss, said \xe2\x80\x9cfirst class letter,\xe2\x80\x9d and took my change.'b'Then I discovered some vending machines outside the office. People came and bought stamps. \xe2\x80\x9cSo many people must be into stamp collecting,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself. Was that another weird American quirk? Otherwise, why would people waste money buying stamps in advance, without having their letters weighed?'b'Something I take for granted now just didn\xe2\x80\x99t occur to me: There were standardized rates, and you could just slap a stamp on your letter, drop it in a mailbox, and it would go to its destination.'b'I then encountered a visa service that asked me to mail in my passport. My precious, precious passport. With a self-addressed, stamped envelope for its return. I laughed at the audacity of the request. Despite being a broke student, I booked a plane trip. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t envision putting my passport in the mail. I\xe2\x80\x99ve since learned that this is a common practice, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve even done it once or twice myself. But it still does not come easy to me.'b'I noticed that Americans were a particularly patriotic bunch: So many of them had red flags on their mailboxes. Sometimes they would put those flags up. I presumed it was to celebrate national holidays I did not yet know about. But why did some people have their flags up while others did not? And why weren\xe2\x80\x99t they American flags anyway? As in Istanbul, where I grew up, I assumed patriotism had different interpretations and expressions.'b'The mystery was solved when I noticed a letter carrier 'b'emptying'b' a mailbox. I was slightly unnerved: Was the mail being stolen? He then went over to another mailbox with the flag up, and emptied that box, too. I got my hint when he skipped the mailbox with the flag down.'b'Yes, I was told, in the United States, mail gets picked up from your house, six days a week, free of charge.'b'I told my friends in Turkey about all this. They shook their heads in disbelief, wondering how easily I had been recruited as a C.I.A. agent, saying implausibly flattering things about my new country. The United States in the world\xe2\x80\x99s imagination is a place of risk taking and ruthless competition, not one of reliable public services.'b'I bit my tongue and did not tell my already suspicious friends that the country was also dotted with libraries that provided books to all patrons free of charge. They wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe me anyway since I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t believed it myself. My first time in a library in the United States was very brief: I walked in, looked around, and ran right back out in a panic, certain that I had accidentally used the wrong entrance. Surely, these open stacks full of books were reserved for staff only. I was used to libraries being rare, and their few books inaccessible. To this day, my heart races a bit in a library.'b'Over the years, I\xe2\x80\x99ve come to appreciate the link between infrastructure, innovation \xe2\x80\x94 and even ruthless competition. Much of our modern economy thrives here because you can order things online and expect them to be delivered. There are major private delivery services, too, but the United States Postal Service is often better equipped to make it to certain destinations. In fact, Internet sellers, and even private carriers, often use the U.S.P.S. as their delivery mechanism to addresses outside densely populated cities.'b'Almost every aspect of the most innovative parts of the United States, from cutting-edge medical research to its technology scene, thrives on publicly funded infrastructure. The post office is struggling these days, in some ways because of how much people rely on the web to do much of what they used to turn to the post office for. But the Internet is a testament to infrastructure, too: It exists partly because the National Science Foundation funded much of the research that makes it possible. Even some of the Internet\xe2\x80\x99s biggest companies, like Google, got a start from 'b'N.S.F.-funded research'b'.'b'Infrastructure is often the least-appreciated part of what makes a country strong, and what makes innovation take flight. From my spot in line at the post office, I see a country that does both well; not a country that emphasizes one at the expense of the other.'b'IT was the spring of 1991 \xe2\x80\x94 more than two decades before Ferguson, Mo., would become a national symbol of racism \xe2\x80\x94 when my parents took my siblings and me to visit their hometown, St. Louis. We spent the week hanging out with our cousins, with whom we were close. I was 16, too young to tag along when, the night before we were supposed to return home to Maryland, my 19-year-old brother, Tom Cummins, and our cousins, Julie and Robin Kerry, were brutally attacked by four strangers. Julie was 20, Robin, 19.'b'The strangers were young people, too. They raped my cousins and restrained my brother before forcing them off a bridge into the Mississippi River. Only my brother survived.'b'Forensic DNA analysis was in its infancy in 1991. Besides, most of that kind of evidence was destroyed by the river. Julie was in the water for three weeks before her body was recovered; Robin\xe2\x80\x99s body was never found. Still, my brother\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, combined with his identification of the perpetrators and their own incriminating statements, was damning.'b'There was also substantiating evidence: One of the men had my brother\xe2\x80\x99s watch, another left a stolen flashlight at the crime scene. The youngest, Daniel Winfrey, who was 15 at the time, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and testified against the others. Eventually, all four were convicted of murder. During the lengthy appeals process, more proof emerged: A few years ago, DNA tests conducted on the single condom in evidence 'b'verified'b' that one of the four friends, Marlin Gray, raped at least one of my cousins. He was executed in 2005.'b'When the police questioned another of the men, Reginald Clemons, in 1991, he confessed to raping (but not killing) my cousins. He was convicted of their first-degree murders in 1993. He now claims he is innocent, and in November, Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court ruled to 'b'vacate those convictions'b' because it determined that prosecutors might have suppressed evidence suggesting that his confession was coerced. For the purposes of clarity, let us acknowledge that \xe2\x80\x9ccoerced\xe2\x80\x9d means 'b'beaten out of him'b'.'b'This has been the elephant in our 25-year-old waiting room, and it feels cathartic to finally say: Yes, the police most likely did beat Reginald Clemons. In fact I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure they did, because while they briefly suspected my brother, they beat him, too.'b'For the longest time, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care that Reginald Clemons was probably beaten. I would gladly have beaten him myself, and then some. I believed that civil rights were for innocent people. But when police officers disregarded his civil rights, and then the media reduced that fact to a headline, it allowed him to leverage the noble voice of victimhood and dictate a distorted narrative that further violated my cousins and their memory.'b'I have written about this story before. But there\xe2\x80\x99s one element of it that I always avoided: race.'b'For almost 25 years, I asserted that race had no place in the discussion of what happened to my family. I still don\xe2\x80\x99t want to write about race. What I mean is, I 'b'really 'b'don\xe2\x80\x99t want to write about race. I\xe2\x80\x99m terrified of striking the wrong chord, of being vulnerable, of uncovering shameful ignorance in my psyche. I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of being misinterpreted.'b'I am white. The grandmother I shared with Julie and Robin was Puerto Rican, and their father is half Lebanese. But in every practical way, my family is mostly white. I\xe2\x80\x99ll never know the impotent rage of being profiled, or encounter institutionalized hurdles to success because of my skin or hair or name. But I care about race and equality. And it\xe2\x80\x99s imperative for white people to join the conversation about racism. Discomfort is the least of our obligations.'b'When my cousins were raped and murdered five miles from Ferguson, that violence was an act of indiscriminate brutality. There is no reason to believe there was any racial element to the crime, though three out of its four perpetrators (all but Daniel Winfrey) were African-American, and their victims were white. The aftermath of that tragedy was a different story.'b'In St. Louis, the murders were big, splashy news. Privately, when I told white people what had happened, they would sometimes whisper, \xe2\x80\x9cWere the guys 'b'black'b'?\xe2\x80\x9d Publicly, the media narrative quickly deteriorated into sensationalism. On message boards and radio call-in shows, blatant racists made disturbing calls for vengeance, using awful phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cstring \xe2\x80\x99em up.\xe2\x80\x9d That ugliness prompted a backlash. Defenders of the four men used words like \xe2\x80\x9crailroaded,\xe2\x80\x9d claiming the charges and the trial were racially motivated.'b'My family ducked away from all of it because it made us sick. We didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to respond. It\xe2\x80\x99s a cruel irony that the night they were murdered, my cousins were taking Tom to see a poem they\xe2\x80\x99d spray painted on the bridge about the horrors of racism. So yes, while my white cousins were attacked by some black men, the emphasis on race felt ludicrously, infuriatingly off topic. Sometimes a person is just guilty, not because he\xe2\x80\x99s black, but because he\xe2\x80\x99s a murderer. All the hatred began to obscure the only fact that mattered: that Julie and Robin were dead.'b'For now, Reginald Clemons is still in prison, serving a 15-year sentence for his conviction in 2007 for assaulting a guard. But in the coming weeks, prosecutors will have to decide between these two unthinkable options: the ordeal of a new murder trial, or his eventual liberation. In either case, this sequel to my family\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare was preventable.'b'When those cops put their hands on Reginald Clemons, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t just violate him; they violated the justice that Julie and Robin deserve. What happened to him doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offset his guilt.'b'Whatever comes next will now occur against the backdrop of a racially explosive Ferguson. Within that context, my family cannot submit to anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s definition of who we are. No one is allowed to co-opt my cousins\xe2\x80\x99 memory into their own racist narrative. We are not the poster family for \xe2\x80\x9cvictimized\xe2\x80\x9d white people. No one can make us bigots by grafting ignorant presumptions onto our grief.'b'THIS holiday season, there was something in the air that was even more inescapable than the scent of pumpkin spice: gratitude.'b'In November, NPR issued a number of brief exhortations to cultivate gratitude, culminating in an hourlong special on the \xe2\x80\x9cscience of gratitude,\xe2\x80\x9d narrated by Susan Sarandon. Writers in Time magazine, The New York Times and Scientific American recommended it as a surefire ticket to happiness and even better health. Robert Emmons, a psychology professor at the University of California, Davis, who studies the \xe2\x80\x9cscience of gratitude,\xe2\x80\x9d argues that it leads to a stronger immune system and lower blood pressure, as well as \xe2\x80\x9cmore joy and pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s good to express our thanks, of course, to those who deserve recognition. But this holiday gratitude is all about you, and how you can feel better.'b'Gratitude is hardly a fresh face on the self-improvement scene. By the turn of the century, Oprah Winfrey and other motivational figures were promoting an \xe2\x80\x9cattitude of gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin Seligman, the father of \xe2\x80\x9cpositive psychology,\xe2\x80\x9d which is often enlisted to provide some sort of scientific basis for \xe2\x80\x9cpositive thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d has been offering instruction in gratitude for more than a decade. In the logic of positive self-improvement, anything that feels good \xe2\x80\x94 from scenic walks to family gatherings to expressing gratitude \xe2\x80\x94 is worth repeating.'b'Positive thinking was in part undone by its own silliness, glaringly displayed in the 2006 best seller \xe2\x80\x9cThe Secret,\xe2\x80\x9d which announced that you could have anything, like the expensive necklace you\xe2\x80\x99d been coveting, simply by \xe2\x80\x9cvisualizing\xe2\x80\x9d it in your possession.'b'The financial crash of 2008 further dimmed the luster of positive thinking, which had done so much to lure would-be homeowners and predatory mortgage lenders into a speculative frenzy. This left the self-improvement field open to more cautious stances, like mindfulness and resilience and \xe2\x80\x94 for those who could still muster it \xe2\x80\x94 gratitude.'b'Gratitude is at least potentially more prosocial than the alternative self-improvement techniques. You have to be grateful to 'b'someone'b', who could be an invisible God, but might as well be a friend, mentor or family member. The gratitude literature often advises loving, human interactions: writing a \xe2\x80\x9cgratitude letter\xe2\x80\x9d to a helpful colleague, for example, or taking time to tell a family member how wonderful they are. These are good things to do, in a moral sense, and the new gratitude gurus are here to tell us that they also 'b'feel'b' good.'b'But is gratitude always appropriate? The answer depends on who\xe2\x80\x99s giving it and who\xe2\x80\x99s getting it or, very commonly in our divided society, how much of the wealth gap it\xe2\x80\x99s expected to bridge. Suppose you were an $8-an-hour Walmart employee who saw her base pay elevated this year, by company fiat, to $9 an hour. Should you be grateful to the Waltons, who are the richest family in America? Or to Walmart\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, whose annual base pay is close to $1 million and whose home sits on nearly 100 acres of land in Bentonville, Ark.? Grateful people have been habitually dismissed as \xe2\x80\x9cchumps,\xe2\x80\x9d and in this hypothetical case, the term would seem to apply.'b'Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s no surprise that gratitude\xe2\x80\x99s rise to self-help celebrity status owes a lot to the conservative-leaning John Templeton Foundation. At the start of this decade, the foundation, which promotes free-market capitalism, gave $5.6 million to Dr. Emmons, the gratitude researcher. It also funded a $3 million initiative called Expanding the Science and Practice of Gratitude through the Greater Good Science Center at the University of California, Berkeley, which co-produced the special that aired on NPR. The foundation does not fund projects to directly improve the lives of poor individuals, but it has spent a great deal, through efforts like these, to improve their attitudes.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a safe guess, though, that most of the people targeted by gratitude exhortations actually have something to be grateful for, such as Janice Kaplan, the author of the memoir \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gratitude Diaries,\xe2\x80\x9d who spent a year appreciating her high-earning husband and successful grown children. And it is here that the pro-social promise of gratitude begins to dim. True, saying \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\xe2\x80\x9d is widely encouraged, but much of the gratitude advice involves no communication or interaction of any kind.'b'Consider this, from a yoga instructor on 'b'CNN.com'b': \xe2\x80\x9cCultivate your sense of gratitude by incorporating giving thanks into a personal morning ritual such as writing in a gratitude journal, repeating an affirmation or practicing a meditation. It could even be as simple as writing what you give thanks for on a sticky note and posting it on your mirror or computer. To help you establish a daily routine, create a \xe2\x80\x98thankfulness\xe2\x80\x99 reminder on your phone or computer to pop up every morning and prompt you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Who is interacting here? \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cyou.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The 'b'Harvard Mental Health Letter'b' begins its list of gratitude interventions with the advice that you should send a thank-you letter as often as once a month, but all the other suggested exercises can be undertaken without human contact: \xe2\x80\x9cthank someone mentally,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ckeep a gratitude journal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccount your blessings,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmeditate\xe2\x80\x9d and, for those who are so inclined, \xe2\x80\x9cpray.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to achieve the recommended levels of gratitude without spending a penny or uttering a word. All you have to do is to generate, within yourself, the good feelings associated with gratitude, and then bask in its warm, comforting glow. If there is any loving involved in this, it is self-love, and the current hoopla around gratitude is a celebration of onanism.'b'Yet there is a need for more gratitude, especially from those who have a roof over their heads and food on their table. Only it should be a more vigorous and inclusive sort of gratitude than what is being urged on us now. Who picked the lettuce in the fields, processed the standing rib roast, drove these products to the stores, stacked them on the supermarket shelves and, of course, prepared them and brought them to the table? Saying grace to an abstract God is an evasion; there are crowds, whole communities of actual people, many of them with aching backs and tenuous finances, who made the meal possible.'b'The real challenge of gratitude lies in figuring out how to express our debt to them, whether through generous tips or, say, by supporting their demands for decent pay and better working conditions. But now we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about gratitude, we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about a far more muscular impulse \xe2\x80\x94 and this is, to use the old-fashioned term, \xe2\x80\x9csolidarity\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'\xe2\x80\x94 'b'which may involve getting up off the yoga mat.'b'IF you are black, you\xe2\x80\x99re far more likely to see your electricity cut, more likely to be sued over a debt, and more likely to land in jail because of a parking ticket.'b'It is not unreasonable to attribute these perils to discrimination. But there\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the main reason small financial problems can have such a disproportionate effect on black families is that, for largely historical reasons rooted in racism, they have far smaller financial reserves to fall back on than white families.'b'The most recent federal survey in 2013 put the difference in net worth between the typical white and black family at $131,000. That\xe2\x80\x99s a big number, but here\xe2\x80\x99s an even more troubling statistic: About one-quarter of African-American families 'b'had less than $5 in reserve'b'. Low-income whites had about $375.'b'Any setback, from a medical emergency to the unexpected loss of hours at work, can be devastating. It means that harsh punishments for the failure to pay small debts harm black families inordinately. Sometimes, the consequence is jail. Other times, electricity is cut, or wages garnished.'b'The modern roots of the racial wealth gap can be traced back to the post-World War II housing boom, when federal agencies blocked loans to black Americans, locking them out of the greatest wealth accumulation this country has ever experienced. More recently, the bursting of the housing bubble and subsequent recession slammed minorities. In 2013, the median wealth of white households was 'b'13 times'b' the median wealth of black households, the widest gap since 1989.'b'Earlier this year, my colleague Annie Waldman and I took a close look at debt-collection lawsuits in three major American cities. We expected to see a pattern driven by income, with collectors and credit card lenders suing people most often in lower-income areas.'b'But income was just half the story. Even accounting for income, the rate of court judgments from these lawsuits was 'b'twice as high in mostly black communities as it was in mostly white ones'b'. In some neighborhoods in Newark and St. Louis, we found more than one judgment for every four residents over a five-year period. Many were families who, knocked off their feet by medical bills or job loss or other problems, had simply been unable to recover.'b'When debts turn into court judgments, plaintiffs gain the power to collect by cleaning out bank accounts and seizing wages. Federal and state laws generally don\xe2\x80\x99t protect anyone but the poorest debtors, and because judgments are valid for a decade or more, the threat of garnishment can linger for years. The paycheck from that new job may suddenly be slashed and savings may disappear.'b'Sometimes the consequence of not having the money to pay a bill is immediate: The power goes out. In a 2009 national survey of lower-income households by the federal Energy Information Administration, 9 percent of blacks reported having their electricity disconnected in the previous year because they had been unable to pay. For whites, the number was less than 4 percent, according to an analysis of the survey by the National Consumer Law Center.'b'And sometimes the consequence of unmanageable debt is to fall further into debt. In a 2013 Federal Reserve survey, about three times as many blacks reported taking out a high-interest payday loan in the previous year as did whites at the same income level. Desperate consumers turn to these loans as a way to catch up on bills, but often get tripped up by unaffordable interest payments.'b'When combined with discriminatory policing practices, the effect of the asset gap is to magnify the racial disparity. In its report on the Ferguson, Mo., Police Department, the Justice Department found that officers disproportionately stopped and ticketed black citizens. For a \xe2\x80\x9cmanner of walking\xe2\x80\x9d violation, it was $302; for \xe2\x80\x9chigh grass and weeds,\xe2\x80\x9d $531.'b'Blacks accounted for about 67 percent of Ferguson\xe2\x80\x99s population and around 85 percent of the municipal court cases. But the numbers were even more lopsided when it came to the harshest consequences. Blacks accounted for 92 percent of the cases where an arrest warrant had been issued to compel payment.'b'And this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a problem only in Ferguson. Earlier this year, the American Civil Liberties Union sued DeKalb County, Ga., which includes part of Atlanta, for jailing citizens over unpaid court fines and unpaid fees charged by a for-profit company that runs probation services for the government. About 55 percent of DeKalb County\xe2\x80\x99s population is black, but the A.C.L.U. found that nearly all probationers jailed for failure to pay those fines and fees were black.'b'The racial wealth gap \xe2\x80\x9ccreates this cyclical effect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Nusrat Choudhury, an A.C.L.U. attorney. An unpaid speeding ticket may result in a suspended driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, which may lead to a more severe violation. Unable to pay their fines, black defendants become more crushingly entangled in debt.'b'Cori Winfield, a single mother in St. Louis, got caught up in this cycle.'b'After she was unable to keep up the payments on a subprime auto loan she took out in 2009, the car was repossessed the next year, but the consequences didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. Because the debt continued to be bloated by interest charges, the lender began garnishing her wages in 2012. The garnishment continues today. Because she was unable to repay, she will end up paying far more than she owed in the first place.'b'Making matters worse for Ms. Winfield, while her wages were being garnished, she was arrested for driving with a license that had been suspended because she had failed to pay a speeding ticket. She ended up spending a weekend in jail and having to pay the cost of bail.'b'Ms. Winfield has a decent clerical job, earning about $30,000 a year. But she lives month to month. When hit with an unexpected expense, she is left reeling.'b'Her vulnerability is typical. In a recent 'b'survey by the Pew Charitable Trusts'b', the typical black household earning between $25,000 and $50,000 reported having emergency savings of $400. The typical white household in that range had $2,100.'b'Black families were much more likely to report difficulty in recovering from a financial setback or to have fallen behind on a bill in the past year. This financial insecurity extended up the income scale. Of black households with income between $50,000 and $85,000, 30 percent said they had been unable to pay a bill. By contrast, only white households with incomes below $25,000 reported similar trouble paying bills; 31 percent said they had fallen behind.'b'What can be done? The best place to start is by identifying practices that are particularly damaging to black communities, and then fixing them.'b'In Missouri, for example, the attorney general recently 'b'proposed a series of reforms'b' for debt-collection lawsuits to ensure that the underlying debt was valid and that lawyers\xe2\x80\x99 fees were not excessive. Collection-industry trade groups supported the proposal.'b'Lawmakers in Missouri and other states 'b'could go further'b' and reduce the amount of income subject to garnishment. In most states (New York and New Jersey are exceptions), defendants can lose a quarter of their post-tax income, a big hit for even middle-income families.'b'Bank accounts are afforded even less protection, allowing collectors to seize funds without limit. It\xe2\x80\x99s a nonsensical system that restricts how much of a worker\xe2\x80\x99s paycheck a collector can seize, but allows collectors to take the entire amount once that check is deposited. Setting even a small dollar amount as automatically off limits to collectors would be a substantial improvement.'b'Changes like that benefit everyone, but they particularly help black families. Policy makers should pay attention. Making it easier to recover from small setbacks can make a big difference in people\xe2\x80\x99s lives.'b'Since President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande of France declared a state of emergency after the terrorist attacks in Paris on Nov. 13, more than 2,700 'b'police raids'b' have been carried out. They have yielded very little that can be linked to terrorism, but have traumatized citizens and left havoc in their wake.'b'The majority of these raids have been on Muslim homes, businesses, mosques and prayer rooms. Ethnic profiling by the police of France\xe2\x80\x99s minorities \xe2\x80\x94 condemned as discriminatory by a Paris appeals court in June \xe2\x80\x94 has returned with a vengeance, and hate crimes against Muslims are on the rise. Yasser Louati, spokesman for the Collective Against Islamophobia in France, warns: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Muslim minority in France feels like it\xe2\x80\x99s being treated as the public enemy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The current state of emergency gives the French government exceptional powers, including the authority to conduct houses searches without a warrant, shut down associations and restrict the right to peaceful assembly \xe2\x80\x94 all without judicial oversight. Individuals may file complaints against the government in court, but only after the fact. Many say they have no idea why they were targeted.'b'Mr. Hollande argues that France is at war with a new kind of enemy \xe2\x80\x94 the Islamist terrorist ready to strike on French soil \xe2\x80\x94 and that the government must have a free hand to tackle the threat. No doubt he has a duty to keep France safe and prevent more attacks, but he already has ample tools at his disposal to do this, including vast new surveillance and other powers conferred by a series of antiterrorism laws passed since he was elected. Nothing in France\xe2\x80\x99s current law stopped Mr. Hollande from declaring the current state of emergency on Nov. 13, or successfully securing its extension through Feb. 26 from Parliament.'b'But Mr. Hollande wants to go further, and amend France\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution to make it easier for the government to declare a state of emergency, remove the possibility of legal challenges to government actions under a state of emergency, including warrantless searches and preventive detention, and make it possible to strip French-born dual nationals convicted of terrorism-related crimes of their French citizenship. (Naturalized dual-national citizens can already be stripped of their French citizenship.)'b'The majority of the more than three million French-born dual nationals hold their second citizenship in a Muslim majority country where one or both of their parents were born. In effect, the citizenship amendment is aimed at French-born Muslims. It has provoked a storm of controversy, as it did when former French President Nicolas Sarkozy proposed it in 2010. At that time, Mr. Hollande and other prominent French Socialists roundly condemned the proposal, arguing that doing so would effectively torpedo one of the cornerstones of France\xe2\x80\x99s democracy: the equality of all citizens before the law.'b'Last month, France\xe2\x80\x99s Council of Ministers accepted the proposed changes to France\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution. The amendments will be debated in Parliament in February.'b'The Parliament should reject these unnecessary and divisive constitutional changes. The push to diminish civil liberties and end judicial oversight will only magnify the potential for the abuse of power, without making the public safer.'b'When he campaigned for the presidency of Mexico, Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto used the title of his book, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMexico, the Great Hope,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'to explain the record he hoped to achieve and the nation he hoped to build. More than three years into his presidency, it seems more likely that he will be remembered not as the transformational leader Mexicans thought they had elected, but as a politician who skirted accountability at every turn.'b'On Mr. Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto\xe2\x80\x99s watch, the Mexican government has swiftly and systematically whitewashed ugly truths and played down scandals.'b'After Mexican journalists revealed that a government contractor had made a lavish home available to Mr. Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto and his wife, the president appointed a friend to investigate the matter. Not surprisingly, the 'b'inquiry found no evidence of wrongdoing'b' by the president. The journalists, despite meticulous, unimpeachable reporting, 'b'lost their jobs. 'b''b'When the country\xe2\x80\x99s most powerful drug kingpin, Joaqu\xc3\xadn Guzm\xc3\xa1n Loera, 'b'escaped from prison'b' in July, 'b'Mexicans were rightly skeptical about'b' the official account, not least because it was Mr. Guzm\xc3\xa1n\xe2\x80\x99s second escape. The government claimed that Mr. Guzm\xc3\xa1n had slipped out through a tunnel he and his accomplices dug unbeknown to prison officials, dismissing the possibility that he had help from the inside. While some officials were arrested as a result of the prison break, the government has yet to fully explain the lapse.'b'More troubling is the government\xe2\x80\x99s botched effort at investigating 'b'the September 2014 disappearance of 43 college students, 'b'who appear to have been massacred in the rural state of Guerrero. The government claimed the students were executed and incinerated by members of a drug gang. A preliminary report issued by a group of international experts from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights in September, citing satellite images, said it was implausible that the bodies had been incinerated.'b'Adding to public skepticism, the government has turned down repeated requests to allow the international team to interview military personnel stationed near the site of the disappearance.'b'It is not too late for the government to acknowledge that its investigation was bungled and to give the international investigators unfettered access to government personnel. That may be too little to salvage Mr. Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto\xe2\x80\x99s reputation. But it\xe2\x80\x99s the least he can do for the victims of one of Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s worst human rights atrocities in recent history.'b'Politics, we\xe2\x80\x99re often told, is governed by rules \xe2\x80\x94 basic principles that explain not just what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen, but what rational candidates and parties can be expected to do. Donald J. Trump seems to casually defy all these rules \xe2\x80\x94 insulting Senator John McCain, a veteran; disparaging women; and building a rhetorical wall to keep out the single demographic group that his party seems to need for its survival, Latinos.'b'And yet with each transgression, his poll numbers bubble upward.'b'Mr. Trump is not the first to test the basic assumptions about how politics works and how we predict outcomes. He may be changing the rules of the presidential primary race, but in the halls of Congress and in governors\xe2\x80\x99 mansions across the country, politicians have already acted in ways that would have been unimaginable a decade ago. By testing and breaking the rules, they have been reshaping the practice of politics since long before Mr. Trump emerged.'b'Take this familiar rule: \xe2\x80\x9cAmericans hate Congress, but love their own member of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d For decades, members of Congress secured re-election even in districts that voted for the other party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidate, through slavish attention to local concerns, ranging from casework (helping constituents navigate Social Security problems) to winning earmarked appropriations for local spending projects, with the ribbon-cuttings that followed. Transactional politics of this kind then helped smooth the wheels in Congress, as leaders handed out earmarks, or federal funding specifically designated for projects in the district, in exchange for cooperation.'b'Half that rule is true: Americans really do still hate Congress. Approval ratings for Congress stood most recently at 13 percent, near a record low. People still think more highly of their own senator or representative, but that\xe2\x80\x99s changing: In 'b'Gallup polls'b' since 2013, about 40 percent disapprove of their own member of Congress, much higher than in previous periods of generalized hostility to the institution. Near majorities now say that their own member is \xe2\x80\x9cout of touch\xe2\x80\x9d and pays more attention to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial interests\xe2\x80\x9d than his or her constituents.'b'Numbers like those would normally foreshadow political doom. But 96 percent of House incumbents won re-election in 2014, and the Republican majority \xe2\x80\x94 despite its own 71 percent 'b'disapproval rating'b' on Election Day \xe2\x80\x94 expanded.'b'With this norm, politicians can effectively ignore many of their constituents without putting re-election at risk, and many have rejected the standard practices of the recent past \xe2\x80\x94 most notably earmarks.'b'Beyond that, several members even announced in 2013 that they would 'b'not assist constituents'b' with problems involving the Affordable Care Act. The idea of not just neglecting but actively refusing constituent services, for reasons of ideology, would be unimaginable to the constituent-focused members of Congress of both parties elected beginning in the 1970s.'b'Governors, too, rejected everything from infrastructure spending to federal funding for Medicaid expansion. Even when they saw their approval ratings drop into the 30s, they survived. In 2011, Rick Scott of Florida 'b'rejected $2.4 billion in federal funds'b' for a commuter rail project and yet got re-elected.'b'Underlying the old rule was a bigger one: the \xe2\x80\x9cmedian voter theorem\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the idea that the views of the typical, middle-of-the-road voter, as expressed through elections, drove parties and politicians. These are the \xe2\x80\x9cReagan Democrats\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csoccer moms\xe2\x80\x9d of recent decades. The political scientists Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson have called this the \xe2\x80\x9cmaster theory\xe2\x80\x9d of their discipline.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not much of a theory at all anymore. Well-organized interest groups like the National Rifle Association and the National Education Association as well as large donors and ideological warriors on both sides have more clout than the median voter because they are organized and focused while most people aren\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'And in many nonpresidential elections, the median voter probably isn\xe2\x80\x99t voting at all. That\xe2\x80\x99s particularly true for low-income people: Election participation 'b'by people in households just below the median income'b' of $52,000 was around 40 percent in 2014, compared with 52 percent for voters in households earning $150,000 or more.'b'Consider another once-useful guideline, which dates to the 1960s: Americans are \xe2\x80\x9cphilosophical conservatives but operational liberals.\xe2\x80\x9d That is, we hate the idea of government, but we value the benefits we get from government \xe2\x80\x94 and politicians act accordingly.'b'Until very recently, this rule explained much of the behavior of conservative Republicans in particular: They would propose abstract cuts, such as a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution or a cap on entitlement spending. Liberals would then recast the proposal in terms of specific cuts affecting children, veterans or seniors. After a little symbolic skirmish, each side would retreat to its corner, with few of the changes to the federal budget that had been promised.'b'This principle restrained even Ronald Reagan from more radical cuts, while making Democrats cautious \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps overcautious \xe2\x80\x94 about advocating large-scale spending programs (recall President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s announcement in 1996 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe era of big government is over\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'Representative Paul Ryan tested the limits of operational liberalism with the budgets he put forward beginning in 2011, with a plan to privatize Medicare for \xe2\x80\x9c'b'future retirees'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and specific cuts to discretionary spending programs. And at least a half-dozen governors put operational liberalism to the test by cutting state spending on education and health in ways that directly affected services. The unpopular governor Sam Brownback of Kansas nonetheless won re-election in 2014, as did Paul LePage of Maine, despite abysmal approval ratings for both, and Wisconsin, North Carolina and Ohio seem to have locked in levels of public investment on education and human services that are far lower than in the recent past and will be difficult to undo.'b'The old deal having been broken, Democrats, in turn, seem more willing to champion broad expansions of government like proposals to expand Social Security or make college free. The ideological alignment of the two parties will soon override these legacies from an earlier era when there were more conservative Democrats and moderate, or even liberal, Republicans.'b'These rules aren\xe2\x80\x99t just convenient ways to analyze politics \xe2\x80\x94 they influence how politicians behave. If politicians believe they need to win favor with the median voter or bring pork home to the district, they will do so. All the old rules lead to the same happy idea: American politics calibrates and centers itself, and it usually pulls parties and most politicians back from the extremes.'b'But in recent years, Republican politicians especially have not only defied the rules, they have also protected themselves from the consequences. Restrictions on voting, along with 'b'aggressive redistricting'b', reduce the influence of the median voter. Campaign war chests (including \xe2\x80\x9csuper PACs\xe2\x80\x9d) scare off opponents, from within their own party as well as the other. By crippling civil-society institutions such as unions and community groups, which organize middle- and lower-income voters, they sometimes avoid being held accountable. They can use ideological media to reach mostly like-minded voters.'b'And by recasting politics as a winner-take-all conflict between wholly incompatible ideologies and identities \xe2\x80\x94 as most of the presidential candidates have done \xe2\x80\x94 they help to closely align party and ideology, so that those who identify as Republican will always vote Republican and vice versa. When politicians know more or less who will vote and how, they can ignore most voters \xe2\x80\x94 including their own loyalists.'b'Long before Mr. Trump came along, the supposedly immutable laws of politics had begun to fall. Mr. Trump is taking defiance in a nervy new direction. Now that congressional leaders, governors and Mr. Trump have shown the rules and customs of American politics to be hollow and unenforceable, we need a new set of tools to understand how democracy works, or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'You have to be seriously geeky to get excited when the Internal Revenue Service releases a new batch of statistics. Well, I\xe2\x80\x99m a big geek; like quite a few other people who work on policy issues, I was eagerly awaiting the I.R.S.\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'tax tables'b' for 2013, which were released last week.'b'And what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.'b'You might think that this is obvious. But on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what President Obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. Whoever the next president is, they assert \xe2\x80\x94 or at least, whoever it is if it\xe2\x80\x99s not Bernie Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. And it\xe2\x80\x99s true that if you were expecting Mr. Obama to preside over a complete transformation of America\xe2\x80\x99s political and economic scene, what he\xe2\x80\x99s actually achieved can seem like a big letdown.'b'But the truth is that Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. Which brings me to those I.R.S. tables.'b'For one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that Mr. Obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. Partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the Bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare.'b'If Mitt Romney had won, we can be sure that Republicans would have found a way to prevent these tax hikes. And we can now see what happened because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t. According to the new tables, the average income tax rate for 99 percent of Americans barely changed from 2012 to 2013, but the tax rate for the top 1 percent rose by 'b'more than four'b' percentage points. The tax rise was even bigger for very high incomes: 6.5 percentage points for the top 0.01 percent.'b'These numbers aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough to give us a full picture of taxes at the top, which requires taking account of other taxes, especially taxes on corporate profits that indirectly affect the income of stockholders. But the available numbers are consistent with 'b'Congressional Budget Office projections'b' of the effects of the 2013 tax increases \xe2\x80\x94 projections which said that the effective federal tax rate on the 1 percent would rise roughly back to its pre-Reagan level. No, really: for top incomes, Mr. Obama has effectively rolled back not just the Bush tax cuts but Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s as well.'b'The point, of course, was not to punish the rich but to raise money for progressive priorities, and while the 2013 tax hike wasn\xe2\x80\x99t gigantic, it was significant. Those higher rates on the 1 percent correspond to about $70 billion a year in revenue. This happens to be in the same ballpark as both 'b'food stamps'b' and budget office estimates of this year\xe2\x80\x99s net 'b'outlays'b' on Obamacare. So we\xe2\x80\x99re not talking about something trivial.'b'Speaking of Obamacare, that\xe2\x80\x99s another thing Republicans would surely have killed if 2012 had gone the other way. Instead, the program went into effect at the beginning of 2014. And the effect on health care has been huge: according to estimates from the 'b'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'b', the number of uninsured Americans fell 17 million between 2012 and the first half of 2015, with further declines most likely ahead.'b'So the 2012 election had major consequences. America would look very different today if it had gone the other way.'b'Now, to be fair, some 'b'widely predicted'b' consequences of Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s re-election \xe2\x80\x94 predicted by his opponents \xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. Gasoline prices didn\xe2\x80\x99t soar. Stocks didn\xe2\x80\x99t plunge. The economy didn\xe2\x80\x99t collapse \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, the U.S. economy has now added more than 'b'twice as many'b' private-sector jobs under Mr. Obama as it did over the same period of the George W. Bush administration, and the unemployment rate is a full point lower than the rate Mr. Romney promised to achieve by the end of 2016.'b'In other words, the 2012 election didn\xe2\x80\x99t just allow progressives to achieve some important goals. It also gave them an opportunity to show that achieving these goals is feasible. No, asking the rich to pay somewhat more in taxes while helping the less fortunate won\xe2\x80\x99t destroy the economy.'b'So now we\xe2\x80\x99re heading for another presidential election. And once again the stakes are high. Whoever the Republicans nominate will be committed to destroying Obamacare and slashing taxes on the wealthy \xe2\x80\x94 in fact, the current G.O.P. tax-cut plans make the Bush cuts look puny. Whoever the Democrats nominate will, first and foremost, be committed to defending the achievements of the past seven years.'b'The bottom line is that presidential elections matter, a lot, even if the people on the ballot aren\xe2\x80\x99t as fiery as you might like. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone tell you otherwise.'b'DESPITE the four-year drought that has parched California and led to mandatory restrictions on water use, farmers there have kept feeding the country. California produces more of 66 different food crops than any other state, 'b'$54 billion 'b'of food annually.'b'Maintaining this level of productivity has been quite a challenge in recent years and is likely to become more difficult over the next few decades as weather patterns, available water and growing seasons shift further and threats of invasive weeds, pests and pathogens rise.'b'If agriculture is to have any chance of answering these challenges, we must have new and improved techniques and technologies. The problem is that agricultural innovation has not kept pace.'b'The last time our nation was in a similar crisis was just after the Dust Bowl years in the 1940s, but the country\xe2\x80\x99s agricultural science enterprise was in much better shape. At that point, 'b'almost 40 percent'b' of American research and development spending was focused on agriculture. This ambitious embrace of research was part of the \xe2\x80\x9cgreen revolution\xe2\x80\x9d that significantly boosted agricultural output around the world.'b'Today, farm production has stopped growing in the United States, and agriculture research is no longer a priority; it constitutes only 2 percent of federal research and development spending. And, according to the Department of Agriculture, total agricultural production has slowed significantly since the turn of the century. We need another ambitious surge in agricultural science.'b'Consider the avian flu epidemic, in which more than 48 million birds were killed \xe2\x80\x94 30 million in Iowa alone \xe2\x80\x94 because the only way to control an outbreak is to eradicate a farm\xe2\x80\x99s entire flock. The Agriculture Department recorded only 219 birds that were actually sick with the flu. The 'b'$3.3 billion in losses'b' have led to a search for a better method of controlling the virus than killing a farm\xe2\x80\x99s flock because of one sick bird.'b'History has shown that science can solve the nation\xe2\x80\x99s agriculture and food production problems, but to do so, the American system of food and agricultural research must be substantially reinvigorated. Research can tackle how to grow more food with fewer resources under increasingly difficult growing conditions. But this can be accomplished only if more of the brightest minds are engaged with enough funding to pursue transformative ideas.'b'While private sector research and development in agriculture have grown over the past decade and now exceed what is federally funded, this financing is focused on shorter term benefits. On the other hand, 'b'more than 80 percent'b' of federally funded research is designed to provide the building blocks for long-term production increases to address the many problems we face in the decades ahead. These problems have been amplified by climate change and the demands of a growing global population.'b'Experience has shown that the best way forward is funding research through a competitive process, with projects selected through a peer-review procedure that excludes politics. There is a program in the Agriculture Department that embraces these tenets, the Agriculture and Food Research Initiative, and its research grants show great promise.'b''b'New, hardier varieties of corn'b' are being developed from tropical species that can better withstand heat, drought and changes to the environment. The probiotics found in fermented products like yogurt are being tested to 'b'replace antibiotics'b' used in animal husbandry. And nanotechnology and electrified micro-coatings of water are being applied to some produce, to 'b'prevent food poisoning'b'. Government research is even exploring how to double the rate of photosynthesis and eliminate the need for pesticides.'b'The potential is great, but the program has never been fully funded. Despite a $25 million increase in the omnibus budget agreement, the budget of the department\xe2\x80\x99s research initiative sits at half of what Congress authorized in 2008 when it created the program. In the 2014 fiscal year, the program\xe2\x80\x99s peer-review process identified approximately $1.1 billion in grants as worthy of funding, but the program could dispense only $270 million. We cannot kindle the next green revolution if we treat roughly three-quarters of a billion dollars in worthwhile scientific ideas as if they were table scraps.'b'Throughout humanity\xe2\x80\x99s existence, farming and food production have always benefited from innovative solutions that solved challenges and looked beyond the horizon. Now more than ever, we need to embrace 21st-century science, fund it and turn it loose so we can develop better methods of putting food on the table. Our world is changing; the way we grow and produce food needs a much richer diet of scientific ingenuity to keep pace.'b'One day last month, Dannel Malloy, the governor of Connecticut, was sitting with a small group of inmates at a New Haven jail, where he had gone to announce a new job-training program for prisoners nearing their release date.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to develop a society that\xe2\x80\x99s a little more forgiving and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to fly right,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Malloy 'b'said to the men'b', according to The New Haven Register. Taken together, these two ideas capture the essence of the reformist philosophy Mr. Malloy has brought to Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s criminal justice system during his five years in office.'b'Under his leadership Connecticut has 'b'repealed the death penalty'b', 'b'legalized medical marijuana'b', and passed 'b'some of the strictest gun laws'b' in the country. And over the past 12 months, the state has become a remarkably productive laboratory for justice reform as Mr. Malloy continues to push for government transparency, societal mercy and individual responsibility.'b'Last February, Mr. Malloy 'b'announced'b' his \xe2\x80\x9cSecond Chance Society\xe2\x80\x9d initiative, which is aimed at reducing the number of people going into prison and making it easier for those already in to get out and have a chance at a law-abiding life.'b'The reform plan reclassified simple drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor and eliminated mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug possession. It expedited parole hearings for people convicted of nonviolent crimes and simplified the pardon process. The 'b' state Legislature approved'b' the package in June with bipartisan support. It also passed a bill Mr. Malloy had pushed to 'b'increase police accountability'b' by providing all troopers with body cameras, recruiting more minority officers, and assigning independent investigators to cases where the police use deadly force.'b'In November, Mr. Malloy announced a new set of reforms to the juvenile justice system. He 'b'proposed'b' that Connecticut become the first state in the country to raise the age of adult criminal responsibility to 21 from 18 for all but the most serious crimes. He pointed out that most people aged 18, 19 and 20, who would be sent to the juvenile system under the plan, are arrested on misdemeanor charges. He called for a separate facility to house inmates 25 and younger, citing new research on brain development.'b'He is also tackling the state\xe2\x80\x99s unfair bail system, which keeps people awaiting trial locked up simply for lack of a few hundred dollars. In those cases, Mr. Malloy said, releasing low-risk defendants to community supervision would be more just and more cost-effective.'b'The Legislature will consider these proposals in its 2016 session.'b'Crucially, Mr. Malloy \xe2\x80\x94 himself a former prosecutor and defense lawyer \xe2\x80\x94 has the support of key figures in law enforcement. His new correction commissioner, Scott Semple, is 'b'moving quickly'b' to convert former prisons into \xe2\x80\x9creintegration centers\xe2\x80\x9d that fight recidivism by providing drug counseling, job training and other services to inmates returning to society.'b'Will any of this work? It\xe2\x80\x99s still too early to know the effect of many of the recent reforms, but earlier efforts are already paying off. For example, after lawmakers raised the age of adult criminal responsibility to 18 from 16, the number of people between 18 and 21 behind bars dropped by more than half. Overall, crime in Connecticut is at a 48-year low, and falling faster than almost anywhere in the country. The state\xe2\x80\x99s prison population is under 15,600, down from nearly 20,000 in 2008, allowing for the closing of three prisons so far.'b'For decades, the politics of crime and punishment in America has been driven by fear and vengeance. That has begun to change, thanks largely to smart and effective new experiments in both conservative and liberal states.'b'Congress may yet pass major federal sentencing reform in 2016, but if America is to reverse its decades-long incarceration boom, it will require the continued efforts of leaders like Mr. Malloy.'b''b'Leonard Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s 'b' barbaric and unnecessary death at the hands of prison guards at the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York highlights the need for independent oversight of the state\xe2\x80\x99s prisons. His beating in 2010, the details of which have only recently come to light, is the latest in a long list of instances of brutality toward inmates in New York\xe2\x80\x99s prison system.'b'The state\xe2\x80\x99s inhumane practices involving solitary confinement have also generated outrage. Thousands of prisoners have been held in extreme isolation, in some cases for years, and often for minor rule violations, at great cost to their mental health and potential for rehabilitation. A settlement announced last month of a lawsuit brought by the New York Civil Liberties Union will reduce both the number of inmates held in isolation and the maximum stay, and will abolish some of the harshest conditions.'b'While this is a welcome move, it provides for only two years of monitoring once it has been implemented and does not address the many issues that affect inmate health and safety for the overwhelming number not in solitary confinement.'b'This is why additional governmental oversight is urgently needed to truly change the culture of a system that holds 53,000 inmates across 54 prisons. What goes on inside these prisons is largely hidden from view, and there is little accountability for wrongdoing.'b'The New York State Commission of Correction has longstanding authority to regulate and visit prisons. The state comptroller pointed out in a 2006 audit that the commission had essentially defaulted on that responsibility. Nine years later, little has changed. The commission investigates some inmate deaths, but it cannot be fairly described as a monitoring body.'b'The result is that New York\xe2\x80\x99s prison system operates almost entirely below the radar. This invisibility should end by setting up a system of effective independent governmental oversight to ensure the health and safety of prisoners. If harm is to be prevented in these dark places, we must know what is happening inside.'b'Nationally, the situation is not better. For example, abuse of prison inmates appears to be endemic in Florida, prison rape is widespread across the country, and the hanging death in a Texas jail cell of Sandra Bland, who was arrested after a routine traffic stop, highlighted the national problem of suicide in custody. (Her family has disputed the finding by authorities that she killed herself.)'b'While we are witnessing a movement for increased police accountability, the need for transparency and accountability is even more urgent in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s jails and prisons, given their closed environments and lack of cellphones and body cameras to capture abusive encounters. These institutions primarily confine the most powerless and vulnerable, including poor people who are disproportionally African-American and Latino, as well as people with mental illness.'b'The New York State Assembly Standing Committee on Correction recently held a hearing about the need for such oversight. We were among the experts invited to testify about what an effective system of oversight might look like.'b'The American Bar Association has 'b' provided clear guidance'b' on this issue, which we helped to develop. It calls for every state to create an independent government monitoring body for its prisons and jails that reports to the public about conditions in those facilities.'b'The State Legislature should follow the A.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s guidance and establish a monitoring body with unfettered access to prison facilities, staff, inmates and records in announced or unannounced visits.'b'The monitor should be empowered to examine and report on all aspects of a facility\xe2\x80\x99s operations that affect inmates, including, for example: medical and mental health care; use of force; inmate violence; conditions of confinement; staffing practices; inmate discipline and use of solitary confinement; substance abuse treatment; educational and rehabilitative programming; and re-entry planning.'b'There also should be an independent investigatory body that reviews complaints and allegations of wrongdoing, including inmate grievances, abuse claims, denial of access to health care and inmate deaths.'b'At the same time, the prison system should enhance its own internal accountability measures, such as its decision to electronically log complaints to monitor accusations of staff misconduct.'b'But in light of recent events, the public is unlikely to be satisfied with a prison agency\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncements that everything is fine or trust the vindications of staff members accused of abusive behavior. Only independent monitoring and investigations can provide that level of public accountability.'b'The costs of this oversight would pale in comparison to the hundreds of millions of dollars paid out in lawsuits stemming from unconstitutional practices and the untold costs associated with ineffective programs and unnecessary use of solitary confinement.'b'Designed correctly, an oversight body can provide an early warning system about patterns of complaints against certain prison employees, assess the appropriateness of discipline meted out to staff members, address concerns about inadequate health care or protocols for dealing with mentally ill inmates, highlight programs that are ineffective, point to areas for improved staff training, and identify policies that need to be adjusted. A monitor could also identify practices worth replicating at other prisons.'b'The awareness by prison staff that a monitor could show up at any time would check employee misbehavior. The culture of a prison changes when outsiders shine a light on its operations and conditions.'b'External oversight will likely result in safer prisons for inmates and employees alike, more effective rehabilitation programs, a healthier prison culture that supports positive outcomes and taxpayer savings from fewer lawsuits and lessened recidivism.'b'Without independent oversight, we will not have a prison system worthy of our values. If further tragedies are to be avoided, the New York Legislature and its counterparts around the nation must provide for comprehensive and meaningful oversight of all correctional facilities.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Dying Alone in Prison'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Dec. 28):'b'Dr. Rachael Bedard\xe2\x80\x99s essay about compassionate release of prisoners raises the fundamental question that the American citizenry has not answered: What is the purpose of incarceration?'b'It would seem from the case of her patient that it is clearly not rehabilitation or public safety, that it must be punishment.

Their statements are meant to appeal to disaffected workers, but they both oversimplify the problems and ignore the real source of trouble.'b'Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, has 'b'promised'b' to bring manufacturing jobs back to American workers from abroad. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t get jobs, because there are no jobs, because China has our jobs and Mexico has our jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump said in his 'b'campaign announcement speech in June'b'. (He neglected to mention that his own line of neckties 'b'is fabricated in China'b'.)'b'Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, seems to regularly misconstrue the state of American manufacturing \xe2\x80\x94 more than any other candidate. At the undercard debate in Milwaukee on Nov. 10, Mr. Huckabee 'b'explained'b' that the United States has lost five million manufacturing jobs since 2000: \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason they don\xe2\x80\x99t have jobs is because their jobs are in Mexico, they\xe2\x80\x99re in China, they\xe2\x80\x99re in Indonesia,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to American workers. While that is certainly true for some of the jobs lost, outsourcing is not the main driver of domestic job loss.'b'Republicans aren\xe2\x80\x99t the only ones obsessing over reclaiming these factory jobs. Last month, Hillary Clinton mentioned factory closings when she released 'b'her own plan'b' to restore manufacturing jobs through a network of tax credits and federal funding for research. Senator Bernie Sanders, meanwhile, in criticizing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, has 'b'argued'b' that such international trade deals are to blame for the loss of manufacturing jobs in this country.'b'The problem with this sort of rhetoric is that a lot of the manufacturing jobs the United States lost over the past 50 years didn\xe2\x80\x99t go overseas; they simply disappeared with the advent of new technology.'b''b'James Sherk'b', a research fellow in labor economics at the Heritage Foundation, said the trend in machines taking over factory work that was previously done by humans has been going on since the 1950s. But for presidential candidates, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to blame other countries rather than robots.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s those basically rote, repetitive tasks where you\xe2\x80\x99re fixing the same thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to imagine any of those positions coming back. Basically, a robot is a lot more affordable than a human employee.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The skills needed to work on a factory floor today are quite different than they were 20, 10 or even five years ago. Don\xe2\x80\x99t blame stingy companies or over-regulation by the government; blame the rapid progress of technology.'b''b'Mark Muro'b', the policy director of the Brookings Institution\xe2\x80\x99s Metropolitan Policy Program, said candidates should recognize that because of advances in technology, manufacturing simply does not employ as many people as it once did. Then again, that level of honesty doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make for as much of a feel-good message.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy fear is that the Republicans to date may not fully understand what modern advanced manufacturing is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily thousands of people pouring into the plant as in the old days.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Instead of talking down to blue-collar workers, candidates should admit that trying to restore manufacturing to what it once was in this country is not an attainable, or even a desirable, goal. This is not to say the government should not work to bring jobs back to the United States, or that manufacturing as an industry is not valuable to the American economy. But many of the jobs politicians want to restore aren\xe2\x80\x99t on the table anymore.'b'Unfortunately, when talking about how they would increase manufacturing, most of the candidates have not reached beyond platitudes and into the realm of reality. And some of the points they have made have been baffling. At the November Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Senator Marco Rubio stressed manufacturing\xe2\x80\x99s role in the economy, while espousing a curious notion of how the new economy works. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you raise the minimum wage, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to make people more expensive than a machine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means all this automation that\xe2\x80\x99s replacing jobs and people right now is only going to be accelerated.\xe2\x80\x9d (He went on to wax poetic about 'b'welders versus philosophers'b'.)'b'It sounded as if Mr. Rubio believed employers should suddenly realize that machine labor is cheaper than human labor \xe2\x80\x94 though that\xe2\x80\x99s been the case for a long time. Machines are cheaper than people, marginal wage increase or not. Yet Mr. Rubio has a point: Automation has fundamentally changed the manufacturing industry. We don\xe2\x80\x99t, however, need to respond to the shrinking manufacturing job market by becoming all-out technophobes.'b'A few examples of solutions currently underway: In 'b'Delaware'b', high school students can participate in a program aimed at preparing them for modern manufacturing jobs. Some academic hubs like Cambridge, Mass., and Raleigh-Durham, N.C., are set up as i'b'nnovation districts'b', where companies and research institutions can commingle with smaller start-ups and job seekers.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no easy answer on how best to foster innovation, though. Even the most enticing tax incentives are unlikely to make companies fire their robots and hire back assembly-line workers. Some of the burden lies with American companies to bring production back home \xe2\x80\x94 which actually could be less of a burden than they might think, according to some economists.'b'The manufacturing sector drives 'b'69 percent'b' of all business-related research and development in the country. The findings of that research and development \xe2\x80\x94 like innovations in 3-D printing and the so-called Internet of things \xe2\x80\x94 ripple across industries. Employing more American workers also gives them more buying power, which is good for the economy as a whole.'b'Americans are world-class consumers. Since the recession, our appetite for buying stuff has grown. In the last quarter of 2014, consumer spending in the United States 'b'rose'b' 4.3 percent \xe2\x80\x94 the fastest rate of growth since 2006 \xe2\x80\x94 though spending 'b'has slowed'b' since then. And the University of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s index of consumer sentiment 'b'rated'b' consumer confidence in 2015 at 92.9, the highest rating posted since 2004. Still, it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear whether Americans would be willing to shell out more money for a product made by their neighbors than one made halfway across the world.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have yet to prove that American consumers are willing to pay a premium for products sourced in the U.S.,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Willy C. Shih'b', a professor at Harvard Business School and a co-author of the book \xe2\x80\x9cProducing Prosperity: Why America Needs a Manufacturing Renaissance.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line is, what product do they put in their shopping basket in the store?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No candidate wants to be painted as anti-manufacturing, which may account for this lack of honesty about where all the manufacturing jobs have gone. When the moderator Sandra Smith dared to suggest 'b'during the Nov. 10 undercard debate'b' that the United States is moving away from \xe2\x80\x9ca manufacturing economy to a services-based, technological economy,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Huckabee quickly shot her premise down. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know why we have to move away from manufacturing,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Huckabee replied. The audience applauded.'b'Mr. Huckabee is right; the United States doesn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9chave\xe2\x80\x9d to move away from manufacturing. It\xe2\x80\x99s just that advancing economies like this one inevitably sacrifice some labor for innovation, just as the United States and other developed countries did over the past century when it came to agriculture.'b'If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to move away from anything, let\xe2\x80\x99s leave behind stock stump speeches on factories. They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to get anyone a job \xe2\x80\x94 especially not in the White House.'b'On New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve some friends and family members had a drink at a bar in Tel Aviv. The next day a gunman shot up the place, killing two people and wounding at least five. When I heard about the shooting I was horrified, of course, but there was no special emotion caused by the proximity 16 hours before.'b'These days, we all live at risk of random terror, whether we are in Paris, San Bernardino, Boston or Fort Hood. Many of us have had brushes with these sorts of attacks. It\xe2\x80\x99s partly randomness that determines whether you happen to be in the wrong spot at the wrong time.'b'But there is something important about the accumulation of these random killing sprees \xe2\x80\x94 the way it affects the social psychology and the culture we all inhabit. We are living in the age of small terror.'b'In Israel, there\xe2\x80\x99s the wave of stabbings. In this country we have shooting sprees in schools and in theaters. In cities there are police killings. In other places there are suicide bombings. This violence is the daily diet of the global news channels.'b'Many of the attacks have religious or political overtones. But there\xe2\x80\x99s always a psychological element, too. Some young adults have separated from their parents but they have not developed an independent self of their own. In order to escape the terror of their own formlessness or insignificance, a few commit to some fanatical belief system. They perform some horrific act they believe will give their life shape, meaning and glory. Creeds like radical Islam offer the illusion that murder and self-annihilation is the noblest form of sacrifice.'b'These self-motivated attacks have become a worldwide social contagion. These diverse acts of small terror have combined to create a general state of anxiety.'b'Fear is an emotion directed at a specific threat, but anxiety is an unfocused corrosive uneasiness. In the age of small terror this anxiety induces a sense that the basic systems of authority are not working, that those in charge are not keeping people safe.'b'People are more likely to have a background sense that life is nastier and more precarious \xe2\x80\x94 red in tooth and claw. They pull in the tribal walls and distrust the outsider. This anxiety makes everybody a little less humane.'b'In country after country this anxiety is challenging the liberal order. I mean philosophic Enlightenment liberalism, not partisan liberalism. It\xe2\x80\x99s the basic belief in open society, free speech, egalitarianism and meliorism (gradual progress). It\xe2\x80\x99s a belief that through reasoned conversation values cohere and fanaticism recedes. It\xe2\x80\x99s the belief that people of all creeds merit tolerance and respect.'b'These liberal assumptions have been challenged from the top for years \xe2\x80\x94 by dictators. But now they are challenged from the bottom, by populist anti-liberals who support the National Front in France, UKIP in Britain, Viktor Orban in Hungary, Vladimir Putin in Russia and, in some guises, Donald Trump in the U.S.'b'The surge of anti-liberalism has meant one of the most important political fissures is now between those who support an open society and those who support a closed society. Back in the 1990s, openness and the withering of borders was all the rage, but now parts of the left embrace closed trade policies and parts of the right embrace closed cultural and migration policies.'b'Anti-liberalism has been most noticeable on the right. Classically liberal conservatives are in retreat, as voters look for strongmen who will close borders and stultify the demographic and social fabric. It\xe2\x80\x99s too soon to tell if the Republican Party will have fewer evangelical voters this year, but the tenor of debate has certainly been less Christian \xe2\x80\x94 less charitable, less hospitable to the stranger.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s up to us who believe in open society to wage an intellectual counterattack. This can\xe2\x80\x99t be done be repeating 1990s bromides about free choice and the natural harmony among peoples. You can\xe2\x80\x99t beat moral fanaticism with weak tea moral relativism.'b'You can only beat it with commitment pluralism. People are only fulfilled when they make deep moral commitments. The danger comes when they are fanatically and monopolistically committed to only one thing.'b'The pluralist is committed to a philosophy or faith, but also to an ethnicity and also to a city, and also to a job and also to diverse interests and fascinating foreign cultures. These different commitments balance and moderate one another. A life in diverse worlds with diverse people weaves together into one humane, multifaceted existence. The rigidity of one belief system is forced to confront the messiness of work relationships or a neighborhood association.'b'The anxiety caused by small terror can produce nasty mental habits. Mental resilience becomes as important as physical resilience. That means remaking the case for open society, open cultures and a basic commitment to moral pluralism. Openness is worth the occasional horror fanatics cause.'b'Los Angeles \xe2\x80\x94 THE 'b'National Football League'b' is looking for the safest way for its players to get smashed. How can they avoid brain injury while still getting run over by the gravy train?'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s a good question. What\xe2\x80\x99s the safest way to get hit by a truck? What\xe2\x80\x99s the safest way to hit someone with a bat?'b'The league\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on \xe2\x80\x9cheads up\xe2\x80\x9d tackling (so that players lead with their shoulders) and fines for helmet-to-helmet hits and its new concussion-management protocol are supposedly making the game less hazardous. Last season, the rate of concussions among N.F.L. players fell 25 percent, the league has said.'b'But \xe2\x80\x9csafe football\xe2\x80\x9d is a mincing of words. These reforms do nothing to change how the game is played \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the plays that teams choose to run \xe2\x80\x94 which is what actually makes the game so dangerous. Blaming an N.F.L. football player for a hit is like blaming a bullet for a homicide. By the time the play starts, it is too late.'b'When we watch a football player on the field, we are watching the movement of the entire football-industrial complex. Most directly, we are watching the instructions of his coach. You don\xe2\x80\x99t step on the field unless you execute the plan. What\xe2\x80\x99s the plan? Six seconds of tactical assault. But football is not deadly because of those six seconds. It is deadly because of the 40 seconds of play clock that precede it, the 40 seconds when the coach gets to decide his next attack.'b'When a boxer gets knocked down, he has 10 seconds to get up or the fight is over. In 'b'mixed martial arts'b', if a blow sends a fighter to the canvas and she is unable to defend herself, the fight is over instantly.'b'Football? You\xe2\x80\x99ve got 40 seconds.'b'Forty seconds to shake it off and bring the heart rate back down. Forty seconds to huddle up and await instructions through a speaker in the quarterback\xe2\x80\x99s earhole'b'.'b' Forty seconds to stage a meticulously choreographed onslaught, practiced ad infinitum to the bark of coaches who have nothing physically invested in the violence they demand. Want to make the game safer? Give them less time to demand it. Cut the play clock to 25 seconds.'b'Doing so would remove the huddle from the game, turning it into a permanent \xe2\x80\x9churry up\xe2\x80\x9d offense. Plays would look similar: just looser, less linear, less rigid, more open to improvisation.'b'These days, improvising on a football field gets you fired. But a shortened play clock would require it. Coaches would still control the basic strategy, but the players would control its application, communicating with one another more and engaging their otherwise static athletic minds, familiar mostly with obeying orders.'b'A shortened play clock might also make obese linemen lose weight, since there\xe2\x80\x99d be less standing around and more hustling. And since all players would be more tired, they would have less strength when delivering hits. Blows would become less deadly.'b'The quickened pace would also make concussed players easier to spot, and less able to conceal their symptoms, which they now do at all costs. The rest of us might consider the concussion debate a step in the right direction, but the players see it differently. Their career window to play in the N.F.L. is small. You fall in line. You don\xe2\x80\x99t bring attention to yourself. You follow instructions. Landing yourself in the concussion protocol, which can keep you off the field indefinitely, is a good way to lose your job, like it or not.'b'The N.F.L. train is dragged along by short bursts of manic energy: six seconds from the players and 40 for everyone else to pull up a seat and bang on the table. Every play is now viewed and reviewed and re-reviewed. Maniacal adherence to nearly indecipherable rules by aging men in heated booths causes mistakes to run in slow-motion loops. Outrage floods the wires. The game needs to speed up, for all of our sakes.'b'The threat that concussions pose to football is really a threat to its promoters. The game will live on despite them, and will morph to meet the sensibilities of an ever-changing national conscience. Forty seconds isn\xe2\x80\x99t what it used to be. These days, it\xe2\x80\x99s giving the delicate fingers too much time to dictate the action, too much time to steer players into oncoming traffic.'b'Football players are known to struggle with life after football. Some of this is because of injuries sustained while playing, but much of it is psychological. What do I do with myself in the real world? There\xe2\x80\x99s no huddle for me out here. We are making a generation of tough boys; it is true. But what good is toughness without brains?'b'A new survey by NBC News and Esquire magazine measures what anyone paying attention to Campaign 2016 already knows \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Americans are angry'b', especially white, middle-class Americans.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9crage survey\xe2\x80\x9d released this week found that half of Americans say they are more angry than they were a year ago, and a plurality of them say they get mad at least once every day at something they hear or read in the news. They say that they\xe2\x80\x99re living in a less-powerful America, that life hasn\xe2\x80\x99t turned out the way they had hoped, and that for them, the American dream has died.'b'This fury is a bipartisan thing: More than three-quarters of Republicans and two-thirds of Democrats surveyed feel this way. Two presidential candidates have positioned themselves to ride this discontent: Donald Trump, who is seeking the Republican nomination, and Bernie Sanders, who wants the Democratic nomination. Their appeals couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more different.'b'In his pledges to banish undocumented Mexican immigrants, Muslims and most foreign competition from the American landscape, Mr. Trump plays on what the survey\xe2\x80\x99s authors call \xe2\x80\x9cthe anger of 'b'perceived disenfranchisement \xe2\x80\x94 'b'a sense that the majority has become a persecuted minority.\xe2\x80\x9d These people 'b'could be Republicans or Democrats; they 'b'don\xe2\x80\x99t agree that immigration strengthens the nation and are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly\xe2\x80\x9d more likely to say the American dream is dead and twice as likely to say \xe2\x80\x9cwhite men are struggling to keep up in today\xe2\x80\x99s world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, taps into voters who say their American dream is ending because hard work doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pay off like it used to. Even as his fellow candidates have emphasized national security issues, Mr. Sanders has stubbornly stuck to a domestic message: The richest Americans are getting richer while the poor get poorer.'b'This message cuts across racial and gender lines and 'b'is based on sound numbers'b'. For almost four decades, inflation-adjusted wage increases have not kept pace with American workers\xe2\x80\x99 increased productivity, nor with the rate of economic growth; middle-class Americans who are the muscle behind the nation\xe2\x80\x99s economy are basically working harder for less. To boot, the 'b'only'b' Americans who saw their incomes rise between 2006 and 2014 were those at or near the top of the income scale.'b'The rage survey suggests that people with a household income of $50,000 to $75,000 are the angriest of all. That\xe2\x80\x99s Middle America.'b'This spitting-mad electorate presents challenges for all candidates, but it\xe2\x80\x99s these two who are confronting it directly. History shows that public outrage can be misdirected against people and institutions that aren\xe2\x80\x99t the cause of the discontent, or harnessed to drive corrective policy. Mr. Trump has chosen the first course, Mr. Sanders the second. Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s challenge now is to show angry Americans a realistic path out of their predicament \xe2\x80\x94 and then get them to the polls.'b'TO many skeptics, particularly on the right, the spectacular failure of the solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra in 2011, after receiving a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, demonstrated the industry\xe2\x80\x99s shaky future and the danger of government efforts to subsidize it to success.'b'Fast forward to today. Solar energy prices have continued to fall rapidly, twice as many Americans work in the solar industry as in coal mining, and last year one-third of new electricity generation came from 'b'solar power'b'.'b'Solar, long viewed through the lens of crony capitalism, has shown the ability to inject real market competition in energy distribution, one of the last monopolies in the energy sector, while improving the efficiency of the grid and putting more dollars in the pockets of middle-class Americans. Conservatives, in other words, need to take another look at solar.'b'The case for solar isn\xe2\x80\x99t limited to prices and jobs. Consumers want choice. Unfortunately, in most markets around the country, electricity is still one of the few areas where we have virtually no choice over our supplier. Imagine you want to buy a G.M. car, but you were told you can buy only a Toyota. You\xe2\x80\x99d be outraged \xe2\x80\x94 yet this is how almost all Americans are forced to procure their electricity.'b'Solar also solves an efficiency challenge. Right now, demand peaks during the daytime, far exceeding the supply of baseload power. To meet demand, we have invested in a great deal of spare capacity. Most of this capacity comes from coal and 'b'natural gas'b' plants that run only for a fraction of the day. According to the 'b'Energy Information Administration'b', outside of peak hours, most natural gas-fired power plants in America used only 5 percent of their total capacity in 2012.'b'Again, to borrow an automotive analogy, you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy a new car just for those few days you had extra errands. Instead, you\xe2\x80\x99d call an Uber or rent a Zipcar. That\xe2\x80\x99s the same role rooftop solar panels can play for our energy challenges \xe2\x80\x94 instead of building another huge plant for a few peak hours, we can build just as much solar capacity as we need.'b'Critics of solar have often said that it produces only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the sun is shining,\xe2\x80\x9d and that is true. Fortunately, we need energy most during the daytime \xe2\x80\x94 making rooftop solar a smart choice for consumers while adding energy to the grid when we need it most.'b'And while challenges of storage and metering policies remain, both technology and regulatory models have made significant strides. States like California are considering metering policies that incentivize solar consumers to reduce their demand at peak hours and enable them to sell energy back into the grid when the grid needs it most. Technologies like Google\xe2\x80\x99s Nest \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d thermostat and Tesla\xe2\x80\x99s home battery are making it easier for consumers to monitor their energy consumption and better store renewable energy when the sun isn\xe2\x80\x99t shining.'b'Of course, conservatives will respond that their core objection remains: Solar functions only because of government subsidies. But there are a couple of issues to consider.'b'For one thing, not all subsidies are created equal, and the government actually has a good track record in promoting new energy technologies. New developments often face two market gaps that can potentially delay or even kill them: the \xe2\x80\x9ctechnological valley of death,\xe2\x80\x9d in which promising advances hit a technical brick wall, and the \xe2\x80\x9ccommercialization valley of death,\xe2\x80\x9d in which an effective technology can\xe2\x80\x99t get to market. Government research labs and subsidies have supported a number of forms of energy \xe2\x80\x94 from 'b'nuclear energy'b', to hydraulic fracturing, to photovoltaic solar \xe2\x80\x94 through these troughs.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing unique about the government\xe2\x80\x99s support for solar. According to the 'b'Congressional Research Service'b', total government support for the 'b'oil'b' and gas sector over the years dwarfs the amount of support for the solar industry.'b'Furthermore, the solar investment tax credit is pretty smart. It\xe2\x80\x99s structured so that as solar power becomes more efficient, the effect of the credit on each watt produced becomes smaller. Ideally, we would let markets decide the winners on their own, but so long as government is intervening in markets, it should do so in an evenhanded way. Similarly, any government support for the solar industry should be impartial, rather than having government bureaucracy pick and choose favored companies as it does through its loan guarantee program. The solar investment tax credit comes close to that ideal.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in free-market economic theory that precludes government support. Markets tend to underproduce what economists call positive externalities \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the broad social benefits, like a cleaner environment, that aren\xe2\x80\x99t captured on a company\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet.'b'Solar panels, and the companies that make them, are replete with such benefits: They eliminate redundant power plants that otherwise lie idle, empower consumer choice and have fewer negative consequences than most other forms of energy. But markets don\xe2\x80\x99t always reflect these, which is why it makes sense for subsidies to enter the picture.'b'The kerfuffle over the Solyndra collapse aside, many conservatives already agree, and have for years. When I was at the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush, we believed that an across-the-board energy policy was by far the best approach \xe2\x80\x94 and that included solar. From both a market and an environmental point of view, supporting the solar industry should make sense, no matter which side of the aisle you come from.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Dimiter Kenarov asks us to accept Russia\xe2\x80\x99s illegal annexation of Crimea (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Ending Crimea\xe2\x80\x99s Isolation'b',\xe2\x80\x9d Op-Ed, 'b'nytimes.com'b', Dec. 27).

Mr. Obama is not taking away any law-abiding citizen\xe2\x80\x99s guns or changing the Second Amendment. To the contrary, his actions are in line with the stated priorities of gun-rights activists: keeping guns from people likely to use them in crimes, and enforcing gun laws already on the books.'b'One key action will require more gun sellers to be federally licensed and perform a background check for every attempted purchase. Tens of thousands of dealers already follow these rules, but many others are able to evade them by relying on vague language in the law. While they are a small fraction of all unlicensed sellers, these dealers account for an outsized percentage of guns sold, 'b'according to a study'b' by the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety. For obvious reasons, they are also more likely to appeal to criminals and others trying to hide from the authorities.'b'The law will be clarified to consider not only how many guns these dealers sell, but also how quickly they resell them after purchasing them, whether they sell them in their original packaging and how much they profit.'b'The president is also taking steps to improve the functioning of the federal background-check database, a critically important tool that has stopped millions of sales of weapons to prohibited people since 1998. Among other things, the F.B.I. will work to notify state and local authorities whenever a prohibited person tries to buy a gun and is rejected. This is a 'b'sensible and proven approach'b' to reducing gun crime. In Virginia, follow-up investigations of those denied a gun because of a background check have led to more than 14,000 arrests.'b'Other presidential actions include delivering a budget proposal with money for 200 new agents and investigators for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to help enforce existing gun laws; requiring dealers to notify authorities when guns are lost or stolen in transit; increasing law enforcement access to mental-health records; and providing funding for research into gun-safety technology.'b'None of the actions will make a big dent in America\xe2\x80\x99s gun-violence epidemic, but that\xe2\x80\x99s because Mr. Obama can do only so much on his own. Congress could pass far more expansive and effective legislation, such as universal background checks, which 'b'have been associated'b' with large declines in gun deaths in the 18 states that have implemented them.'b'But even as they talk about being the people\xe2\x80\x99s representatives, members of Congress, almost all of them Republican, have chosen to do the bidding of a gun lobby that is astonishingly out of step with the public. For years, 'b'about 9 in 10 Americans'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly as many households with a National Rifle Association member \xe2\x80\x94 have supported universal background checks, and yet the N.R.A. 'b'reflexively opposes them'b'.'b'So who better represents the wishes of the American people?'b'WHEN 'b'Saudi Arabia'b' executed the Shiite cleric and political dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr on Saturday, the country\xe2\x80\x99s leaders were aware that doing so would upset their longtime rivals in 'b'Iran'b'. In fact, the royal court in Riyadh was probably counting on it. It got what it wanted. The deterioration of relations has been precipitous: Protesters in Tehran sacked Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s embassy; in retaliation, Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties. More severe fallout could follow \xe2\x80\x94 possibly even war.'b'Why did Saudi Arabia want this now? Because the kingdom is under pressure: Oil prices, on which the economy depends almost entirely, are plummeting; a thaw in Iranian-American relations threatens to diminish Riyadh\xe2\x80\x99s special place in regional politics; the Saudi military is failing in its war in Yemen.'b'In this context, a row with Iran is not a problem so much as an opportunity. The royals in Riyadh most likely believe that it will allow them to stop dissent at home, shore up support among the Sunni majority and bring regional allies to their side. In the short term, they may be right. But eventually, stoking sectarianism will only empower extremists and further destabilize an already explosive region.'b'Over the past decade, Saudi rulers have turned to Iran and Shiites every time they needed an easy scapegoat. Anti-Iranian and anti-Shiite sentiments have long existed among religious extremists in the kingdom, but today they are at the heart of Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s national identity. This development is dangerous for Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s Shiite community, estimated at 10 to 15 percent of the population, and for the entire Middle East.'b'This is hardly the first time Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s Shiites have come under fire. Sectarianism under Saudi rule dates back to the early 20th century. But until recently, the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have balanced strong-armed tactics with efforts to accommodate community leaders, seeking to minimize the dangers of sectarianism.'b'After the 2003 invasion of Iraq unleashed a new wave of Sunni-Shiite tension across the Middle East, Riyadh started to shift course. But in 2011, as the Arab world exploded in popular protests, the Saudi government cemented its commitment to sectarian confrontation. The Shiite majority population in neighboring Bahrain rose up against the Sunni-dominated monarchy. The Shiite minority in Saudi Arabia also took to the streets, protesting for political reform.'b'Invoking Iran and Shiites as a terrifying menace, Saudi rulers framed everything from domestic protests to intervention in Yemen in sectarian terms and in the process sought not only to demonize a minority group, but also to undermine the appeal of political reform and protest.'b'Sheikh Nimr had a long history of challenging the Saudi ruling family, but it was his post-2011 activism that led to his execution. After speaking defiantly about anti-Shiite discrimination, he was chased and arrested by Saudi police in July 2012. The police who apprehended him claimed that he had fired on them. Officially, Sheikh Nimr was executed for sedition and other charges. More likely, he was executed for being critical of power. He was not a liberal, but he gave voice to the kinds of criticisms the Saudi royals fear most and tolerate least.'b'Still, Sheikh Nimr\xe2\x80\x99s execution was more important for what it communicated to the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s domestic allies and to potential future dissidents. The emergence of anti-Shiite sentiment over the past decade has not only been used to stamp out efforts by the Shiite minority to gain more political rights. In quashing calls for democracy originating from the Shiite community, Riyadh has also undermined broader demands for political reform by casting protesters as un-Islamic. Many Sunni reformers who cooperated with Shiites in the past have since stopped.'b'The Saudi authorities have good reason to be concerned about new calls for reform. About a week before Sheikh Nimr\xe2\x80\x99s execution, the kingdom announced that it was facing an almost $100 billion deficit for its 2016 national budget. Declining oil revenues may soon force the kingdom to slash spending on social welfare programs, subsidized water, gasoline and jobs \xe2\x80\x94 the very social contract that informally binds ruler and ruled in Saudi Arabia. The killing of a prominent member of a loathed religious minority deflects attention from impending economic pressure.'b'The danger in Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing sectarian and anti-Iranian incitement \xe2\x80\x94 of which Sheikh Nimr\xe2\x80\x99s execution is just one part \xe2\x80\x94 is that it is uncontrollable. As is clear in Syria, Iraq and even further afield, sectarian hostility has taken on a life beyond what the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s architects are able to manage. This has already proved to be the case in Saudi Arabia, where terrorists aligned with the Islamic State have carried out several suicide bombings on Shiite mosques in the past year.'b'The real problem is not just that Saudis are willing to live with violent sectarianism. They are now beholden to it, too. That the kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s leaders have embraced sectarianism so recklessly suggests that they have little other choice. This should be frightening, considering more is likely to be in store. But it should also be clarifying for those who believe that Saudi Arabia is a force for stability in the Middle East. It is not.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Saudi Execution of Shiite Cleric Draws Outrage'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 3):'b'At some point the world has to be firmer in condemning Saudi Arabia on its human rights violations as well as actions that serve only to increase tensions within the region and increase anti-Western sentiment in the Middle East.

It is hard to imagine that the Sunni rulers of the kingdom were not aware of the sectarian passions the killings would unleash around the region. They may even have counted on the fierce reaction in Iran and elsewhere as a distraction from economic problems at home and to silence dissenters. America\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding alliance with the House of Saud is no reason for the Obama administration to do anything less than clearly condemn this foolhardy and dangerous course with a more robust response than its call Monday for both sides to exercise restraint.'b'The immediate consequence of the executions was a burst of hostility between 'b'Saudi Arabia and Iran'b'. The two rivals are already backing opposite sides in civil wars in 'b'Syria'b' and 'b'Yemen'b'. Iranians infuriated by the killing of a revered cleric promptly 'b'ransacked'b' and set fire to the 'b'Saudi Embassy in Tehran'b'. Though Iranian leaders condemned the action and arrested protesters, Saudi Arabia and its 'b'Sunni-led allies'b' in Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates were quick to 'b'cut or curtail ties with Iran'b'.'b'That in turn promised to set back international efforts to resolve the wars in Syria and Yemen and to combat the 'b'Islamic State'b' and other Islamist terrorist organizations. Just weeks ago, a series of talks led by the United States and Russia and including the Saudi and Iranian foreign ministers brought rival powers to the table to discuss a road map for 'b'peace in Syria'b'. Then, on Saturday after announcing the executions, the Saudis ended a shaky cease-fire in Yemen.'b'Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s income has sharply declined as a result of the prolonged drop in 'b'oil prices'b' \xe2\x80\x94 caused, in part, by the regime\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on maintaining production levels \xe2\x80\x94 and the government has announced cutbacks in the lavish welfare spending that Saudis have long taken for granted. The executions provided both a sectarian crisis to deflect anger over the cutbacks and a graphic warning of what can befall critics.'b'But the 'b'executions'b' were not out of character for Saudi Arabia. The country has a dismal human rights record with its application of stern Islamic law and its 'b'repression of women'b' and practitioners of religious traditions other than Sunni Islam. The regime has become only more repressive in the years since the Arab Spring. According to 'b'Human Rights Watch'b', the mass execution this weekend followed a year in which 158 people were executed, the most in recent history, largely based on vague laws and dubious trials. Sheikh Nimr was a vocal critic of the regime and champion of the rights of the Shiite minority in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, but not an advocate of violent action.'b'The tangled and volatile realities of the Middle East do not give the United States or the European Union the luxury of choosing or rejecting allies on moral criteria. Washington has no choice but to deal with regimes like those in Tehran, which also has an abysmal human rights record, including nearly 'b' 700 executions'b' in the first half of last year, or in Riyadh to combat the clear and present danger posed by Islamist terrorists or to search for solutions to massively destabilizing conflicts like the Syrian civil war. But that cannot mean condoning actions that blatantly fan sectarian hatreds, undermine efforts at stabilizing the region and crudely violate human rights.'b'In 1965, at the height of his substance abuse, Johnny Cash was called in to make a deposition, but not about possessing drugs. Instead, the singer was in trouble for leaving a burning truck at the side of a road in Los Padres National Forest in California. The flames had started a forest fire that jeopardized not only the refuge itself, but the lives of nearly 50 critically endangered California condors, which at that time made up a sizable portion of the global population. Facing the prospect of a lawsuit, and filled with \xe2\x80\x9camphetamines and arrogance,\xe2\x80\x9d as his autobiography put it, Cash defiantly told his government questioners, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn about your yellow buzzards.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a sentiment I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard before, though rarely in such choice language. When you\xe2\x80\x99re a birder, you learn quickly that not everyone shares your fascination with condors, cranes and warblers. And, considering recent events in Oregon, it seems that not everyone appreciates the value of a nature preserve, either.'b'There are multiple ways to view the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge headquarters by armed anti-government protesters under the leadership of Ammon Bundy. On Esquire\xe2\x80\x99s website, Charles P. Pierce 'b'labeled it'b' nothing less than \xe2\x80\x9carmed sedition,\xe2\x80\x9d while others have demanded that the authorities use the standard term for armed men threatening violence in order to advance a political cause: terrorists. Some take the matter more lightly, mocking the occupiers\xe2\x80\x99 publicly requesting that snacks and socks be sent to them \xe2\x80\x94 via the United States Postal Service \xe2\x80\x94 for their combination of ill-preparedness and dependence on a federal agency. Derisive Twitter users have called the Oregon group \xe2\x80\x9cVanilla ISIS.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Birders do, as a rule, hope to properly name any observed species, but in this instance most of us are concerned less with the gunmen\xe2\x80\x99s classification and more with their behavior. They have taken over a federal building and threatened violence if officials try to remove them, and their plan is to force the federal government \xe2\x80\x9cto give up its unconstitutional presence in this county,\xe2\x80\x9d according to what 'b'Mr. Bundy said Monday'b'. He is leading this action, 'b'he explained'b', so \xe2\x80\x9cpeople can reclaim their resources.\xe2\x80\x9d The identities of the people who will be doing this reclaiming remain unclear, but to me this action seems much like many others in American history: a loudly proclaimed defense of principle intended to cover up a land grab.'b'And the land being grabbed? It\xe2\x80\x99s ours.'b'The Malheur refuge itself was 'b'established'b' by Teddy Roosevelt, an avid outdoorsman who in 1908 set aside federal property around three Oregon lakes as a place for migratory birds to breed, one of more than 'b'50 such refuges'b' created during his presidency. I wonder sometimes whether T.R. became a conservationist because he came from New York City, a place where the principle of setting aside land for the public is close to sacred. This can be observed every spring, as thousands of urban birders fill New York\xe2\x80\x99s carefully defined green spaces, hoping to get a glimpse of the brightly feathered migrants that settle in the trees on their way north \xe2\x80\x94 without kicking out the Frisbee players in their midst.'b'But in effect, what the Bundy gang is doing is denying the value of such shared, set-aside space. Their demands are unclear, but at the very least it appears that by seizing the refuge\xe2\x80\x99s land, which can now be 'b'visited'b' by anyone, and returning it to \xe2\x80\x9cthe people,\xe2\x80\x9d some of the people on it would be transformed into trespassers. Perhaps in the wide-open spaces of eastern Oregon, the idea that land should be equally shared among the members of the public makes less sense, but to those of us who live on top of one another elsewhere in the United States, there is no question that some property just can\xe2\x80\x99t be private.'b'Malheur is such a property. A birder will tell you that more than 320 different bird species have been recorded at the refuge, and more than 130 have nested there \xe2\x80\x94 a pretty fair total considering the entire North American continent hosts about 800. But this isn\xe2\x80\x99t just a tiny spot on the map where hard-core birders can ooh and aah over rarities. Because the refuge lies along the 'b'Pacific Flyway'b', a common route for migration, a substantial part of a given species\xe2\x80\x99 population may well come through in the spring and fall. Mel White, an author and birder, says that when they see more than 300,000 snow geese in Malheur during migration, \xe2\x80\x9ceven non-birders will be impressed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the purpose of a national wildlife refuge: to use our collective wealth and will to protect something important to all of us. The Blackwater refuge in Maryland has treated me to the stirring sight of hundreds of wintering tundra swans, while in New Mexico, I glimpsed the comical crests of my first-ever scaled quail at the Bitter Lake refuge. At Nebraska\xe2\x80\x99s Crescent Lake, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the tiny tiger-striped chicks of the pied-billed grebe floating close to their mother, while overhead graceful black terns balanced in the wind, a thousand miles from the sea.'b'I value my time on these refuges deeply, but I am also well aware that anything I see there \xe2\x80\x94 everything I see there \xe2\x80\x94 can also be seen by anyone who follows me. When I use that land, I do not use it up.'b'And that, I think, is where Mr. Bundy and his followers miss the point: When land is held by the federal government they so despise, that land belongs to us all. You cannot \xe2\x80\x9creclaim\xe2\x80\x9d territory for the \xe2\x80\x9cpeople\xe2\x80\x9d if they already own it. The seizure of Malheur is an attempt to claim the land, at the point of a gun, for unnamed individuals, all while taking it away from every other American. Whatever this action may be, it is not patriotism.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s worth noting that when the fledgling United States was searching for a symbol, we didn\xe2\x80\x99t pick what might have seemed the most fearsome creature within our national boundaries, the grizzly bear, or the most visible, the American bison. Instead we chose a creature that simply rises above any division of territory: the bald eagle. Not everyone gives a damn about it. But maybe everyone should.'b'TO outsiders, one of the puzzling aspects of the anti-government militia\xe2\x80\x99s takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge is its location. Twenty-five million birds a year visit the refuge in the high desert of southeastern Oregon, but few people have heard of it. Yet Malheur is a place of bitterly contested human histories that remain potent today.'b'Years ago, when I first visited the refuge, I stumbled upon five dead coyotes tossed across a trail, their necks sliced open, blood clotted on their fur, paws hacked off, entrails draining into the river. Ranchers on the edge of failure feel threatened by predators snatching away their calves, and some lash out against that threat. But these five dead coyotes signaled more than just economic anxiety \xe2\x80\x94 they were emblematic of past hatreds that are still a powerful force in the Malheur basin. Anger at predators, environmentalists and federal managers who threaten the mythic past of cowboys on the range is as strong there as anywhere in the West.'b'In the late 1970s and the 1980s, many Western ranchers, miners and loggers felt increasingly threatened, partly by globalization, which created new competition, and partly by federal regulations that seemed to value wildlife more than people. What became known as the Sagebrush Rebellion gave locals a focus for their concern.'b'Environmentalists, they argued, were conspiring to destroy America, starting with rural communities. Many ranchers bitterly complained about the federal land management agencies. They felt powerless, hemmed in by policies they had little hand in shaping. They feared that economic gains were passing them by.'b'These complaints contain elements of truth: Rural communities in the West are poorer than urban communities, and environmental protections enacted since the 1980s have reduced grazing on federal lands. But locals told an interesting version of this history. Before the federal agencies came, they said, we lived in paradise. The grass was thick, the water was abundant and the towns were thriving. We were independent, working out our problems. When the feds came, they stole our resources, and our economies collapsed.'b'The implication was clear: If they got rid of the federal government, they\xe2\x80\x99d have control over their land and lives again.'b'This version of history bears little resemblance to the actual past. Before the federal agencies came to eastern Oregon, large ranching operations from California had monopolized hundreds of thousands of acres of rangeland. Irrigation developers controlled water, cattle barons controlled the grass, and settlers were essentially locked out. Tensions were high.'b'During the 1890s, a populist, anti-monopolist rhetoric emerged among settlers and news editors. The local newspaper deplored the fact that the great Western ranges were passing into \xe2\x80\x9cthe hands of a few big cattle or sheep companies,\xe2\x80\x9d and predicted that soon \xe2\x80\x9can aristocracy of range lords and cattle kings would rule our mountains and plains.\xe2\x80\x9d In 1897, Peter French, the cattle baron who controlled the largest ranching empire in America, along the Blitzen River, was murdered by an angry homesteader. Arson, violence and grinding poverty flourished.'b'In the first decades of the 20th century, the conservationist William Finley paddled a little boat through the marshes of the basin and came upon a colony of egrets slaughtered by plume hunters, the young left to starve. Out of hundreds of thousands of egrets that had once nested in Malheur Lake, only 121 were left.'b'Horrified, Mr. Finley did his best to publicize Malheur\xe2\x80\x99s remaining bounty of waterfowl, shorebirds, egrets, herons, cranes and ibises. In 1908, he persuaded President Theodore Roosevelt to designate Malheur Lake a wildlife refuge. But Congress denied any funding for its management, water rights were not granted and, as droughts hit and lake levels dropped, settlers squatted on the lake bed. By the 1930s, after four decades of overgrazing, irrigation withdrawals, grain agriculture, dredging and channelization, followed by several years of drought, Malheur had become a dust bowl.'b'Ranches failed, livestock starved, homesteaders went bust and the primary occupation in the valley became suing one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbor over water rights.'b'Conservationists won a major victory in 1934 when French\xe2\x80\x99s former cattle empire was sold to the refuge, ensuring it had the water needed to flourish. John Scharff, the refuge manager from 1935 to 1971, worked closely with ranchers to establish grazing leases that funded the restoration of former wetlands and won public support for the effort. By 1968, cattle use was nearly as intense as during the days of the cattle barons. Ranchers still imagined themselves as the rugged individualists of their romantic past, though they had become heavily subsidized, grazing their herds on refuge meadows for fees that were often lower than those on private lands.'b'In the 1970s, government concern grew over the effects of grazing on waterfowl, trout and aquatic health. When Mr. Scharff retired, the new refuge manager had the difficult task of restoring wildlife habitat by reducing cattle numbers. By law, on federal wildlife refuges, the first priority is wildlife. Other uses are allowed when they enhance wildlife habitat, but not when they harm it. Nonetheless, when the new manager lowered the number of grazing permits, controversy erupted over cows versus birds \xe2\x80\x94 anger that continues to simmer in the basin.'b'When mythic histories supplant the complexities of the past, the results can be lethal. Equitable futures for Western public lands won\xe2\x80\x99t be achieved when ideologues swagger in, brandishing guns and taking over federal buildings. Rather, they develop from the hard work of collaboration, like the 2013 effort that brought together the local community, tribes, conservation groups and the state and federal governments to develop a new management plan for Malheur. These are the efforts that best respect the region\xe2\x80\x99s history while pointing the way to a sustainable future.'b'What has Donald Trump tapped into that other Republican candidates are missing? I posed this question to some of my best sources.'b'Jonathan Haidt, the author of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Righteous Mind'b',\xe2\x80\x9d emailed me his response.'b'Many American voters, Haidt wrote,'b'Haidt, a professor at N.Y.U.\xe2\x80\x99s Stern School of Business, argues that Trump'b'In other words, the segment of the electorate drawn to Trump is especially receptive to mobilization at times of perceived disorder \xe2\x80\x94 of a belief in looming external threats, from the Islamic State to Syrian refugees to illegal immigration from Latin America.'b'Noting that conservatives are preoccupied with notions of purity and 'b'disgust'b', Haidt also offers an explanation of some of the more remarkable oddities of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s political approach in an 'b'online'b' posting:'b''b'Jesse Graham'b', a professor of psychology at the University of Southern California, elaborated on the 'b'purity-disgust dimension'b' of this year\xe2\x80\x99s political campaign:'b'These themes, in Graham\xe2\x80\x99s view, have laid the groundwork for Trump\xe2\x80\x99s popularity with 'b'explicitly racist and fascist'b' groups:'b'According to Graham, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s personal style attracts voters, 'b'including current and former Democrats'b', who are drawn to authoritarian leaders:'b'John Jost, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U., picks up some of the same themes as Haidt and Graham. In an email he writes that Trump'b'Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, was emphatic in placing authoritarianism first in describing Trump\xe2\x80\x99s current success.'b'Abramowitz is one of a number of scholars who see Trump as posing a significant danger to American democracy. He wrote in an email that Trump'b'Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign style, his bullying and his pointed insults of competitors, fit into the psychological research concept of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'social dominance orientation'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d The level of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s social dominance orientation is determined by agreement or disagreement with a series of statements. Those with a social dominance orientation agree strongly with such statements as:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome groups of people are simply inferior to other groups;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. if some groups have more of a chance in life than others;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto get ahead in life, it is sometimes necessary to step on other groups.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And they disagree with such statements as: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be good if groups could be equal;\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwe should do what we can to equalize conditions for different groups;\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cno group should dominate in society.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Jim Sidanius'b', a professor of sociology at Harvard and one of the originators, in the 1990s, of the concept of social dominance orientation, said in a phone interview that Trump had captured \xe2\x80\x9cthe resentment and sense of loss\xe2\x80\x9d in a large segment of the white electorate:'b'Sidanius argues that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters have been receptive to this kind of appeal since Obama\xe2\x80\x99s victory in 2008 and his re-election in 2012, but until now, \xe2\x80\x9cnobody was there to exploit it, to pick out the marketing opportunity. This is Trump\xe2\x80\x99s genius.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nowhere has Trump\xe2\x80\x99s appeal been better captured than in a 'b'focus group of 29 supporters'b' conducted in Alexandria, Va., on Dec. 9 by the Republican pollster Frank Luntz. Portions of Luntz\xe2\x80\x99s transcript read:'b'Luntz asked the group if Trump acted presidential when he said he \xe2\x80\x9cwould bomb the BLEEP out of ISIS?\xe2\x80\x9d The 29 participants replied in unison \xe2\x80\x9cyes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For these voters, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s transgression of conventional boundaries is a selling point, not a liability:'b'Stephen Ansolabehere, a political scientist at Harvard, elaborated on Trump\xe2\x80\x99s popularity in an email:'b'Graham and Haidt have found in their research that for the most conservative voters, the two \xe2\x80\x9cvalues\xe2\x80\x9d with the strongest appeal are authority and purity.'b'The accompanying chart, adapted from their 2009 paper \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Liberals and Conservatives Rely on Different Sets of Moral Foundations'b',\xe2\x80\x9d shows how this works: for the most conservative voters, the emphasis on the importance of the values of authority and purity increases while the stress placed on fairness and the avoidance of harm declines.'b'The strong appeal of purity 'b'to committed conservatives'b' helps explain why Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters are not put off by his 'b'compulsive focus'b' on disgust. On Dec. 22, Trump described his reaction to a bathroom break taken by Hillary Clinton during a debate.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere did she go? Where did Hillary go?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at a 'b'rally in Grand Rapids'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cI know where she went, it\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to talk about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He then continued to talk about it: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, it\xe2\x80\x99s too disgusting. Don\xe2\x80\x99t say it, it\xe2\x80\x99s disgusting, let\xe2\x80\x99s not talk.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Earlier in the campaign, Trump also revealed a striking obsession with disgust when he famously attacked Megyn Kelly, the anchorwoman who had challenged him during the Fox News debate. Kelly had confronted Trump: \xe2\x80\x9cYou call women you don\xe2\x80\x99t like \xe2\x80\x98fat pigs,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98dogs,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98slobs\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98disgusting animals,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d asking if Trump was fueling the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on women.\xe2\x80\x9d Explaining his response later, Trump said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As my Times colleague 'b'Frank Bruni noted'b', Trump has a \xe2\x80\x9cbizarre obsession with, and objection to, body fluid,\xe2\x80\x9d especially \xe2\x80\x9cthe fluids of women.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mark Schaller and Justin Park, psychologists at the Universities of British Columbia and Bristol, developed an intriguing evolutionary explanation of strong disgust responses in their 2011 paper \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Behavioral Immune System'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Schaller and Park found in experiments (and by comparing countries culturally) that higher levels of disease or pathogen threat increase \xe2\x80\x9cemphasis on conformity to existing cultural traditions and norms\xe2\x80\x9d while lower threat levels encourage individualism \xe2\x80\x9cdefined in part by a tolerance for (and even encouragement of) deviance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In our conversation, Sidanius posed a key question concerning Trump: Does he represent a growing constituency on the right that will become increasingly powerful or will the Trump phenomenon eventually dissipate?'b'The truth is that Trump has already left an indelible imprint on the political system. He has inflicted tremendous damage on the Republican establishment, as he hoped he would, but he has done much more. By setting a populist agenda that appeals to millions of Republicans and to substantial numbers of Democrats and independents as well, Trump has opened the door to a reshaping of the traditional two-party coalitions.'b'As everything shifts and we question previously sacrosanct boundaries, Trump and his supporters embody conflicts that the American political system will be hard pressed to resolve. Whatever happens next, he has remade the landscape on which these conflicts will be fought \xe2\x80\x94 for better, or, more likely, for worse.'b'From its very inception, Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign for president has been life imitating Twitter. His candidacy is built on Twitter bursts and insults that touch hot buttons, momentarily salve anxieties and put a fist through the face of political correctness, but without any credible programs for implementation.'b'Where Trump has been a true innovator is in his willingness to rhetorically combine positions from the isolationist right, the far right, the center right and the center left. If I were running for president, I\xe2\x80\x99d approach politics in the same way: not as a liberal, a conservative, a libertarian or a centrist.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d run as an extremist.'b'The agenda that could actually make America great again would combine the best ideas of the extreme left and the extreme right. This year is probably too soon for such a radical platform, but by 2020 \xe2\x80\x94 after more extreme weather, after machines replace more middle-class jobs, after more mass shootings and after much more global disorder \xe2\x80\x94 voters will realize that our stale left-right parties can\xe2\x80\x99t produce the needed answers for our postindustrial era. Accelerations in Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law, the market and climate change are transforming the workplace, the environment and nation-states, leaving people feeling insecure and unmoored.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time for a true nonpartisan extremist, one whose platform combines the following:'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 A single-payer universal health care system. If it can work for Canada, Australia and Sweden and provide generally better health outcomes at lower prices, it can work for us, and get U.S. companies out of the health care business.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 Expansion of the earned-income tax credit to top-up wages for low-income workers and introduction of a negative income tax to ensure a government-guaranteed income floor for every American. In an age when machines are gobbling low-skilled jobs, we\xe2\x80\x99ll need both.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 Common Core education standards as the law of the land, to raise education benchmarks across the country, so high school graduates meet the higher skill levels that good jobs will increasingly demand. But those higher standards should be phased in with funding to enable every teacher to have the professional development time to learn the new curriculum those standards require and to buy the materials needed to teach it.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 Controlling low-skilled immigration while removing all limits on H-1B visas for foreign high-skilled knowledge workers and doubling the research funding for our national labs and institutes of health to drive basic research. Nothing would spin off more new good jobs and industries than that combination.'b'\xe2\x96\xa0 New accelerated tax incentives and elimination of all regulatory barriers to rapidly scale up deployment of superfast bandwidth for both wire line and wireless networks to ensure that next-generation Internet services are developed in America.

That means: Slash all corporate taxes, income taxes, personal deductions and corporate subsidies and replace them with a carbon tax, a value-added consumption tax (except on groceries and other necessities), a tax on bullets and a tax on all sugary drinks \xe2\x80\x94 with offsets for the lowest-income earners.'b'We need a tax system that shrinks what we don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x94 carbon, sugar and bullets \xe2\x80\x94 and incentivizes what we need.

His most significant changes have little to do with what he has done in the last 12 months. Instead they were wrought by the justice systems of two foreign countries \xe2\x80\x94 Britain and Spain \xe2\x80\x94 and a slew of Russian and Western journalists and activists. Thanks to all these disparate efforts, there has emerged a vivid, comprehensive and, most important, public picture of allegations of corruption and connections to organized crime that in the past had been the province of rumors or 'b'maverick investigations publishers wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dare to print'b'.'b'Starting in early 2015, there were the 'b'34 days of hearings'b' in London about the death of 'b'Alexander V. Litvinenko'b', the rogue Russian secret-police agent who died of polonium poisoning in England in 2006. The possibility that the Russian government and Mr. Putin himself may have been behind the murder had long been discussed by journalists and 'b'detailed'b' in books, but it took almost a decade for it to be raised in a legal venue.'b''b'The hearings'b', held at the request of the Home Office, formally were \xe2\x80\x9can inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a trial, but they took place in a courthouse and were presided over by a (retired) judge, Sir Robert Owen. (A trial would have been impossible because 'b'Russia'b' has refused to extradite the two men suspected in the murder.) Russian officials snubbed the proceedings. The British lawyer Richard Horwell, representing the Metropolitan Police Service, raged in his 'b'closing statement'b': \xe2\x80\x9cThe Kremlin cannot exactly complain if the eyes of the world look to it for responsibility for Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s murder,\xe2\x80\x9d adding that \xe2\x80\x9cof all of Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s targets, Putin was the one most frequently in his sights.\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Owen is expected to release his report on Jan. 21.'b'In May, Spanish prosecutors 'b'petitioned a Madrid court'b' for permission to charge 27 people with money laundering, after a giant decade-long investigation that implicated, among others, highly placed Russian officials, some of whom have business or property in Spain. The 488-page complaint names a sitting member of the Russian Parliament, a former prime minister and a former defense minister. It draws numerous connections between the presumed ringleader, Gennady Petrov, an influential figure in St. Petersburg, and Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle.'b'In early December, the German television channel ZDF released two films about Mr. Putin. One 'b'presented a comprehensive portrait'b' of the Russian president, reviewing facts and footage that had been known before. The other, called 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Trace of Moscow,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' linked the Litvinenko case to the Spanish investigation: Mr. Litvinenko, it claimed, had been digging into the very connections between Mr. Putin and organized crime that the Spanish investigators exposed. In part thanks to Open Russia, an organization founded by the former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who spent 10 years in prison and now lives in exile in London, both German films got some play on the Russian-language Internet: The organization 'b'translated'b' them and 'b'posted 'b'them on its website.'b'Another corruption probe that unfolded during 2015 implicates Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s own family. Early in the year, the Russian business publication RBC 'b'released an investigation'b' into a vast university expansion project, undertaken on a giant section of land that belongs partly to Moscow State University and partly to the Russian state. The report meticulously documented the sheer scale and scope of the project, and the involvement of many of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s most prominent state and private business managers. But it gingerly stepped around identifying the woman in charge, who had declined to be interviewed. RBC would say only that she was called Katerina Tikhonova \xe2\x80\x94 a very common Russian name \xe2\x80\x94 and that she had been seen in public with Kirill Shamalov, the son of a close friend of Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'The following day the journalist Oleg Kashin 'b'posted on his blog'b' a piece titled, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s Her.\xe2\x80\x9d Katerina Tikhonova, he wrote, was Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s daughter. The president\xe2\x80\x99s press secretary, Dmitri S. Peskov, 'b'responded'b' with a non-denial denial. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know who that is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMany girls have been passed off as Putin\xe2\x80\x99s daughters.\xe2\x80\x9d Then Reuters, in a 'b'large investigation'b' of Russian corruption it published at the end of the year, reported that Ms. Tikhonova, 29, was indeed Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, that Mr. Shamalov was her husband and that both were billionaires.'b'Yet another investigation released last month revealed apparent links between the Russian prosecutor general and the country\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious organized crime family. Such allegations have become so prominent in the public conversation lately, even in Russia, that they were raised with Mr. Putin on Dec. 17, during his highly scripted annual news conference.'b'He dismissed them, including those about his daughter, without engaging with them: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t discuss questions concerning my family members. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in any business, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t involved in politics, they don\xe2\x80\x99t stick their noses anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d But that Mr. Putin had to face such accusations at all shows that a new understanding about Russia is taking hold: Russia is a mafia state \xe2\x80\x94 not only because it is run like the mafia, but also because it is run by organized crime.'b'President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey marched across another line last week. Asked about his push for greatly enhanced executive powers, he 'b'told reporters'b' that there was a precedent in \xe2\x80\x9cHitler\xe2\x80\x99s Germany.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those were shocking words from a world leader, especially one who heads an ostensible democracy and a member of NATO. Once the international condemnations poured in, Mr. Erdogan\xe2\x80\x99s office tried to backtrack, claiming that his remarks were \xe2\x80\x9cdistorted by media outlets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Erdogan, however, had already built a disturbing record as an authoritarian leader willing to trample on human rights, the rule of law and political and press freedoms. Since coming to office more than a decade ago, he has used his powers as prime minister and then president to crack down on the media, labor unions and other critics.'b'Increasingly, many of the worst fears about how he might behave after his conservative and nationalistic Justice and Development Party, the A.K.P., won a crucial 'b'election in November'b' have been confirmed. Even before the voting, in an effort to rally support, Mr. Erdogan resumed his war against militant Kurdish separatists, the Kurdistan Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party, or P.K.K., by exploiting the group\xe2\x80\x99s reckless decision to break a two-year-old cease-fire.'b'He is also going after the Peoples\xe2\x80\x99 Democratic Party, or H.D.P., which got enough votes to qualify for seats in Parliament. The Kurdish-dominated H.D.P. champions Kurdish political rights but is not involved in the fighting.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s allies, America and Europe, have been disgracefully acquiescent as the army brutally pounds Kurdish targets in the country\xe2\x80\x99s southeast region. The 'b'bombardments'b' have hit dozens of urban districts, and since the start of 2015 have killed 3,100 Kurdish militants inside the country and across the border in Iraq, and an unknown number of civilians.'b'Like Turkey, the United States and Europe consider the P.K.K. a terrorist group. Before fighting resumed, Mr. Erdogan had made progress in negotiating a peace agreement with its top leader, Abdullah Ocalan, who is in prison serving a life sentence. More recently, however, his prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, dismissed the H.D.P. as an extension of the militants and has refused to hold talks with its political leaders until they prove themselves \xe2\x80\x9ca serious and genuine political party\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 whatever that means.'b'If Mr. Erdogan wanted a sustainable peace, he would work with the H.D.P. Instead, he seems determined to crush the Kurds in the political arena as well as on the battlefield by accusing an H.D.P. leader, Selahattin Demirtas, of treachery for calling for self-rule for Kurds.'b'Some P.K.K. members qualify as terrorists and should be dealt with firmly. The group, with a radicalized youth branch inspired by the war in Syria, has declared autonomous regions and stepped up its fight for self-rule. Mr. Erdogan undoubtedly fears that it will gain territory like the Kurds did in Iraq and Syria. But most of Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s Kurds just want to live in peace, and their desire for a degree of self-governance should be answered at the negotiating table.'b'Instead of ending the war and integrating Kurds fully into Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s politics, Mr. Erdogan is moving in the opposite direction, quite likely radicalizing more people to conclude that violence is the only path to greater autonomy. Meanwhile, he is ignoring the higher-stakes fight against the Islamic State and further fueling regional tensions. Mr. Erdogan has fallen far from the days when he could be regarded as a respected leader of a Muslim-majority democracy and a trusted partner in the region.'b'Gov. Andrew Cuomo 'b'issued'b' a surprise 'b'executive order'b' over the weekend about homeless people in freezing weather. It was a little confusing.'b'It instructed officials and social service agencies across the state \xe2\x80\x9cto take all necessary steps\xe2\x80\x9d to find homeless people and move them to shelters when it falls below 32 degrees. But officials can\xe2\x80\x99t exactly do that. State law says individuals can be forced into shelter only if they are mentally ill and a danger to themselves or others.'b'The governor\xe2\x80\x99s office later tried to clarify, saying it had not ordered up a dragnet for street people. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously,\xe2\x80\x9d it said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe order does not mandate involuntary commitment for competent individuals.\xe2\x80\x9d It said that Mr. Cuomo merely wanted to make sure officials provide help to those who need it, within the law. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s about love. It\xe2\x80\x99s about compassion. It\xe2\x80\x99s about helping one another and basic human decency,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cuomo said.'b'Right. Even if you consider this an honest attempt to confront an emergency, the order is odd. Officials and advocates in New York City, home to most of the state\xe2\x80\x99s street homeless population, were puzzled. Mayor Bill de Blasio and Police Commissioner William Bratton said it seemed to be telling the city to do what it has done for years.'b'Advocates said they 'b'appreciated'b' Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s sudden interest but pointed out that his order didn\xe2\x80\x99t bolster mental health services or affordable housing. And they wondered how his aggressive tack could be legal or workable. If, as Mr. Cuomo has suggested, people have good reasons to avoid crowded, filthy shelters, why would you force them to go there and keep them there? And when the weather warms up, what have you solved?'b'Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s order seems intended to spotlight, not end, a festering problem in Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s city. And to suggest that the mayor is incompetent to fix it, by reminding people that the homeless seem more abundant than ever.'b'And yet, by bulldozing into the crisis, Mr. Cuomo has put himself on the same page as the mayor. Mr. de Blasio has ramped up his own response in recent weeks, shaking up his staff and offering new spending and outreach programs. On 'b'Tuesday'b' he named a new deputy mayor for health and human services, Herminia Palacio, with homelessness at the heart of her portfolio.'b'Mr. de Blasio and Dr. Palacio need to act. They also need a partner in Albany. Mr. Cuomo should take his urgent concern and make himself useful \xe2\x80\x94 by renewing a defunct state-city partnership to build thousands of units of supportive housing for vulnerable New Yorkers. He should restore state money for homeless services, to make shelters better \xe2\x80\x94 and to get more people out of them.'b'Mr. Cuomo, who toiled in the housing field for decades, is promising to unveil his own ambitious homelessness plan in his State of the State address this month. It will be interesting to see whether it is his expert take on solving the problem, or exploiting it.'b'Sometimes in American politics it seems as if we are all talking past each other, that whatever one side says about an issue like, say, taxes zooms right past the other side. The current fight over gun control is not one of those moments. It is a howling storm of misrepresentation, sadly almost entirely from one side. This week\xe2\x80\x99s developments fit the pattern.'b'On Tuesday in the East Room of the White House, President Obama 'b'formally announced'b' that he would be taking a series of executive actions \xe2\x80\x94 all of them within his powers as president. It was an important step, since he sometimes seems alone in Washington in his willingness to take on the issue of guns. But none of his actions are aimed at taking weapons away from law-abiding citizens, and none will have that effect. In fact, there has been no bill in real contention in Congress for many years that would reduce the number of guns currently in circulation, or disarm any law-abiding Americans.'b'And yet, as happens every time, the response from the anti-regulation crowd (even before the White House 'b'said a word'b' in public about Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s plans) was to deliberately misstate what Mr. Obama was intending. The president said he wanted to increase the number of government agents to process background checks and make the existing system more effective. He also plans to modestly expand the number of dealers who need federal licenses under current law and said he would ask Congress for more money to combat mental illness.'b'The Republican machine\xe2\x80\x99s reaction took none of that into account.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom Day 1,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'said'b' House Speaker Paul Ryan, \xe2\x80\x9cthe president has never respected the right to safe and legal gun ownership that our nation has valued since its founding.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ryan said that \xe2\x80\x9crather than focus on criminals and terrorists, he goes after the most law-abiding of citizens. His words and actions amount to a form of intimidation that undermines liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Unlike Mr. Ryan, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, arch-right candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, did not even wait for the president to talk before he started spitting out his usual talking points on Monday. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a president who for seven years has abused his constitutional authority,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t beat the bad guys by taking away our guns. We beat the bad guys by using our guns.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There may be an interesting argument over whether having more civilians walking around with guns and empowered to use them enhances public safety. Our position on this page has been that it makes people less safe.'b'But propagandists like Mr. Cruz are not interested in conversation. Mr. Obama is not proposing \xe2\x80\x9ctaking away our guns.\xe2\x80\x9d In truth, Mr. Obama is not currently advocating renewal or expansion of the expired assault weapons ban, which is politically understandable but still unfortunate. It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to believe that Mr. Cruz does not recognize what Mr. Obama is doing, and not doing.'b'Given the situation, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine a serious conversation about guns as long as politicians in thrall to the gun lobby choose to misrepresent what supporters of gun safety laws are actually saying. Those supporters, by the way, include the 90 percent of Americans who favor universal background checks for gun buyers.'b'The hear-nothing crowd did not budge when college students were slaughtered on campuses like Virginia Tech, when grade school children were massacred in Connecticut, when people were shot to death in a movie theater in Colorado \xe2\x80\x94 and in so many other places, including every day on our streets and in our homes.'b'They were not even moved to have a serious conversation about gun safety after self-proclaimed Islamist terrorists attacked law-abiding American citizens in California using weapons obtained in the free market of death-dealing instruments so highly prized by the National Rifle Association and those who do its bidding.'b'Remember the Gores? Al and Tipper? At the Democratic convention in 2000, they shared that hungry, happy kiss, and it was more than a meeting of lips. It was a window, or so we thought, into a partnership of enduring passion and inextinguishable tenderness.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re separated now. Have been for more than five years.'b'And the Edwardses? John and Elizabeth? He resembled a Ken doll. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t take after Barbie. That endeared them to voters \xe2\x80\x94 endeared 'b'him 'b'to voters. Only later did we learn about his double life, the furious fights and the copious tears.'b'We know nothing of other people\xe2\x80\x99s marriages. Nothing at all.'b'So why do we pretend otherwise? Why do we make so many assumptions and judgments?'b'And why, every election cycle, do we treat candidates\xe2\x80\x99 spouses and unions as the keys to their characters?'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t trust what\xe2\x80\x99s paraded in front of us any more than we can take what journalists and opponents dig up as the essential truth. A person\xe2\x80\x99s intimate life isn\xe2\x80\x99t readily fathomed, and on the inside tends not to look anything like it does on the outside.'b'Bill Clinton hit the campaign trail this week. That brought back memories, or rather Donald Trump hauled those memories to the surface, and we were reminded anew of all that Bill and Hillary have been through (and have put us through): the infidelities, the intern, the lies, the smears.'b'We were also reminded of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s role in defending him. How did that square with her claim to be a champion of women? It\xe2\x80\x99s fair to ask.'b'But the fascination with the Clintons as a couple goes beyond that question, beyond those scandals, to the belief in many quarters that we can divine something essential about each of them by the fact that they teamed up and stayed together.'b'According to her fans, it\xe2\x80\x99s a measure of her understanding that people are broken, of her capacity for forgiveness, of her belief in commitments. According to her foes, it reveals a thirst for power that redeems any heartbreak and transcends all humiliation.'b'It could be proof of both \xe2\x80\x94 or neither. The answer isn\xe2\x80\x99t gettable. Talk with six different people who know the Clintons well and you hear six different appraisals of their bond, each presented with unalloyed confidence.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that they light up around each other as they light up around no one else.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that there\xe2\x80\x99s no extraordinary spark there, just a storehouse of shared memories, an accretion of endurable disappointments, a daughter, a granddaughter and a friendship.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that they\xe2\x80\x99re really business associates, intricately involved in each other\xe2\x80\x99s lives because they\xe2\x80\x99re jointly invested in the perpetuation of their political relevance.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that they talk more than anyone would imagine. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that they talk less.'b'In New Hampshire on Monday, when he 'b'described'b' his first encounters with her some 45 years ago, he called her \xe2\x80\x9cthe most amazing person\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9cEverything she touched, she made better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe that was a deeply felt tribute. Maybe just a great line.'b'Heidi Cruz will also be in New Hampshire this week. She\xe2\x80\x99s a busy evangelist for Ted, half of a couple who present themselves as perfect. Perhaps.'b'Or perhaps, as the cringe-worthy 'b'outtakes'b' from a Cruz campaign commercial suggest, they\xe2\x80\x99re just equally meticulous about the script on which they\xe2\x80\x99re collaborating, equally intent on a triumphant denouement.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m less and less interested in guessing, because I\xe2\x80\x99m more and more aware of how compartmentalized people are, of how flawed and fruitless it is to extrapolate from one chamber of their lives to another. The stingiest spouse and parent can be the greatest boss, and vice versa. Someone who\xe2\x80\x99s selfless and principled in one context is sometimes the opposite in another, as if there\xe2\x80\x99s only so much goodness to go around.'b'And no chamber resists exploration and explanation like that of a marriage or comparable relationship.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re certain that we have it figured out \xe2\x80\x94 who musters the most patience, who makes the greatest sacrifices, who\xe2\x80\x99s pure, who\xe2\x80\x99s sullied \xe2\x80\x94 until it falls apart. Then we gape at the pieces, because none are recognizable.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re certain that social climbing or religious devotion is a couple\xe2\x80\x99s glue, when what matters more is the secret language of goofy endearments that they speak.

Or the timbre of her laugh.'b'And when we come to our sweeping conclusions, we\xe2\x80\x99re not perceiving but projecting, and we\xe2\x80\x99re using couples to cling to our idealism or validate our cynicism.

It is time to hold direct elections to resolve this conflict.'b'B\xc3\x89LA LIPT\xc3\x81K'b'Stamford, Conn.'b''b'Choosing sides in a very old dispute.'b'In March 1968, my father was a member of the Warsaw University students\xe2\x80\x99 committee that helped lead the enormous protests demanding reform from the Communist Polish government. The government responded with a smear campaign to try to delegitimize the protests\xe2\x80\x99 leaders, claiming they were acting in the interest of Western powers, or \xe2\x80\x94 exploiting widespread anti-Semitic sentiments \xe2\x80\x94 of a Jewish-Zionist plot against the Polish People\xe2\x80\x99s Republic.'b'In other words, the government labeled my father and his friends foreign agents. Traitors.'b'My father was detained for three months and expelled from the university. After his release, he left with his family for 'b'Israel'b', where I was born. Unlike my father, I grew up in an environment that welcomed free political discussion and allowed people like me to become human rights activists and criticize our government. When I claimed a few years ago, after yet another right-wing attack on Israeli human rights organizations, that we had reached \xe2\x80\x9cthe bottom of the pit,\xe2\x80\x9d my father gave me a knowing smile. \xe2\x80\x9cThe pit is much deeper than you think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'My father was right. Over the past month, I have begun to see its true depth.'b'On Dec. 15, an Israeli ultranationalist group released a video portraying four Israeli human rights defenders as moles planted by foreign states to assist terrorists. The 68-second video, which rapidly made its way across Israeli social media, shows four mug shots and claims that \xe2\x80\x9cWhile we fight terror, they fight us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The video is outright slander and an outrageous incitement. It is also the natural evolution of a process led by the government of Israel. Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked deserves to own the copyright on branding human rights organizations as \xe2\x80\x9cagents of foreign governments.\xe2\x80\x9d For years, she has led a campaign to convince the Israeli public that such organizations are the long arm of foreign powers.'b'Last month, in her role as minister, Ms. Shaked introduced a bill that would oblige members of human rights groups to indicate in every correspondence and publication that they are \xe2\x80\x9cfunded by foreign entities.\xe2\x80\x9d The bill would also require human rights workers to wear identifying badges when they hold meetings with Israeli government officials. Last week, the bill passed its first legislative hurdle and received support from the governing coalition. The Knesset will vote on it in the coming weeks and it will likely pass.'b'Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has failed to condemn the video. This is in line with his government\xe2\x80\x99s continuing incitement against Israeli human rights defenders who oppose Israel\xe2\x80\x99s nearly five-decade occupation of 'b'Palestinian'b' territories, its settlement policy and the systematic abuse of Palestinian rights. The government\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown, while dangerous to Israeli society, is ultimately a means for the Netanyahu government to continue deepening the occupation and oppressing millions of Palestinians. Stripped of civil rights and with little influence over their future, they can only dream of the rights and political space Israelis \xe2\x80\x94 even Israeli human rights activists \xe2\x80\x94 still enjoy.'b'With timing that seemed to be coordinated with the release of the video, both the ministers of defense and education announced that Breaking the Silence, a group of Israeli military veterans who oppose the occupation, is now barred from speaking to military units and to schools. Both ministers have smeared the organization as anti-Israel.'b'Incitement against human rights defenders is part of a greater government assault on democratic freedoms. Bills and laws supported by several Netanyahu-led coalition governments between 2009 and today continue to narrow the boundaries of speech and activism in Israel. These include sanctions on anyone who calls for a boycott of Israeli settlements and the power to cut funding for institutions that commemorate the \xe2\x80\x9cNakba\xe2\x80\x9d (the Arabic word for \xe2\x80\x9ccatastrophe\xe2\x80\x9d that is used to describe the expulsion of Palestinians from their homes when the state of Israel was created in 1948). And now there are increased efforts to legally restrict the work of human rights organizations.'b'Israel is turning into a \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical democracy,\xe2\x80\x9d a country that uses the twin hammers of legislation and incitement to strike down dissent. This environment has enabled hate speech against Israeli human rights defenders to flourish to the point that their safety is at risk.'b'The government\xe2\x80\x99s complicity is especially dangerous given the limitations of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s incitement laws. Israeli law does not criminalize political hate speech, unlike hate speech directed at racial, ethnic and religious groups. The United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 1999 'b'Declaration on Human Rights Defenders'b' obliges states to take proactive measures against the stigmatization of rights advocates. This includes condemning assault and incitement against them.'b'Israel is failing to do this. Instead, Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s government is putting itself on the same side as countries that not only do not protect human rights defenders but encourage their harassment, such as Russia, China and Egypt \xe2\x80\x94 and the Communist Poland of my father\xe2\x80\x99s youth.'b'But even as the Israeli government employs Soviet-style incitement to quiet human rights defenders, Israel is still an open society. And this obliges all Israelis who care about human rights to keep raising our voices against injustice. As the Jewish theologian and philosopher Abraham Joshua Heschel once said, \xe2\x80\x9cIn a free society, some are guilty but all are responsible.\xe2\x80\x9d As a second generation \xe2\x80\x9cmole,\xe2\x80\x9d I know that we will not be deterred by incitement or by legislative persecution.'b'BOTH of us  have raised serious questions about 'b'prostate cancer'b' screening. Nevertheless, we hope 'b'Medicare'b' chooses not to pursue a strategy of 'b'penalizing doctors for ordering prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, tests'b'.'b'The case against prostate cancer screening is strong. The heterogeneity underlying 'b'cancer'b' can be described through the metaphor of birds, rabbits and turtles. The goal of early detection is not to let any of the animals escape the barnyard and cause a cancer death. But the birds have already flown away. They are the most aggressive cancers, the ones that have already spread by the time they are detectable, the ones that are beyond cure. The rabbits, potentially lethal cancers that might benefit from treatment, are ready to hop out at any time. These are the cancers we hope to control with early detection.'b'Then there are the turtles \xe2\x80\x94 these are nonlethal cancers that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere. Screening is really good at finding these cancers, and the prostate gland is full of them. Over half of men age 60 and older have small, indolent, nonlethal prostate cancers \xe2\x80\x94 many more than those who have harmful ones. That\xe2\x80\x99s why men are much more likely to die with prostate cancer than from it.'b'Because doctors can\xe2\x80\x99t reliably identify which cancers will become lethal, 'b'PSA'b' screening has led a lot of men \xe2\x80\x94 our'b' 2009 estimate was over one million since the test was introduced in 1987'b' \xe2\x80\x94 to be treated for a cancer destined to never bother them. And treatment frequently leads to 'b'impotence'b' and can cause incontinence and bowel problems.'b'That magnitude of harm might be acceptable if the other cancers caught by screening were mostly those that could benefit from early detection. Unfortunately, the cancers that often kill are those that have already spread microscopically beyond the prostate before screening. Consequently, prostate cancer screening, at best, has only a small impact on the prostate cancer death rate.'b'Lots of people are hurt; few are helped. This is why the 'b'United States Preventive Services Task Force'b' recommends against PSA screening.'b'So why aren\xe2\x80\x99t we celebrating Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s proposal to penalize doctors for doing the test?'b'One reason undoubtedly reflects our professional self-interest: The last thing doctors need is another performance measure. Patient care now requires routine interaction with an electronic medical record \xe2\x80\x94 an interaction that is increasingly interrupted by pop-up windows demanding some often unrelated action to proceed. These serve the dual purpose of data collection and compliance for performance measures. Patients probably do not care that doctors find these intrusions irritating and distracting, but they are often unhappy that doctors are spending more time with the computer and less with them.'b'Second, we are not comfortable rewarding doctors for withholding a test that could help some men. Screening is a gamble: There may be a few winners who win big (avoid a cancer death), but there are often many more losers (patients who go through false alarms, subsequent testing and unneeded treatment). There is no single formula to solve this equation; individuals in the same situation can look at the same data and legitimately make different decisions. When it comes to medical ethics, patient autonomy is about as fundamental as it gets.'b'Finally, a performance measure for not screening reinforces a misleading narrative often invoked by screening proponents: Concerns about early detection are really about saving money. That is not true; the issues raised by early detection would be every bit as relevant even if we had all the money in the world.'b'But early detection is counterintuitive. Most people think that screening works in only one direction: that it can make things only better. But it can also make things worse. Most people think screening will only lower cancer risk. But it can be the fastest way to get a diagnosis of cancer \xe2\x80\x94 one that would otherwise never have been noticed, much less caused harm. Most people think that all the \xe2\x80\x9ccancer survivors\xe2\x80\x9d in the news, and in the neighborhood, provide powerful evidence that screening saves lives. But the survivors whose cancers were caught by screening are less likely to be evidence of its benefit \xe2\x80\x94 because many were treated for a cancer that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going anywhere.'b'This counterintuitive world of screening was highlighted recently with the apparently alarming news that, with less screening, 'b'fewer men are being given a diagnosis of early prostate cancer'b'. It sounds like a bad thing. But it\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what would be expected with less screening \xe2\x80\x94 and may turn out to be a benefit.'b'Nevertheless, screening is a choice. Medicare should not penalize doctors for ordering PSA tests, but it should make sure it is not giving the test away free. Requiring men to bear the small cost of the test is not a punishment, it\xe2\x80\x99s a motivation for them to consider the screening decision more carefully. Not only does the test have important implications for adverse health outcomes in the near future, but it also has near-term implications for some serious out-of-pocket costs from potential follow-up care.'b'Support the process by rewarding doctors for taking the time to discuss the trade-offs patients face. Medicare already requires, and reimburses for, shared decision making for lung cancer screening; it should do the same for prostate cancer screening.'b'There was a predictable ritual to the world\xe2\x80\x99s reaction to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'latest nuclear test'b', its fourth. Vigorous condemnation, followed by promises never to accept the North as a nuclear weapons state, followed by chest-thumping demands for more sanctions. The problem is that while the North Korean threat is real and growing, the United States and its partners have failed miserably at finding an effective solution.'b'Although a final judgment depends on further study, it now appears that North Korea did not detonate a hydrogen bomb on Wednesday as claimed. The test appears to have involved a less-powerful atomic weapon. Regardless, it was another sign of leader Kim Jong-un\xe2\x80\x99s determination to expand his impoverished country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear arsenal in violation of United Nations resolutions, seize the limelight when he feels ignored and keep Asia off balance.'b'In recent years, the United States and other major powers expended maximum effort negotiating a landmark agreement to keep Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. That deal, which is now being implemented, is undeniably important, but the Americans and their partners erred in largely ignoring the even tougher challenge, and more immediate threat, from North Korea.'b'By various estimates, the North 'b'has produced'b' 10 to 16 crude weapons since 2003 and could have as many as 20 'b'by the end of this year'b'. It has also improved the range of its missiles and the mobility of their launchers. The more bombs and missiles North Korea produces, the more likely it is to try to sell these weapons to earn desperately needed hard currency.'b'North Korea stains the record of President Obama, who took office promising to make ridding the world of nuclear weapons a priority. Its actions are a humiliation for President Xi Jinping of China, North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s only ally, largest trading partner and economic lifeline for food and oil. Mr. Xi initially treated Mr. Kim with impatience and disdain, warning him after a nuclear test in 2013 that the North must not threaten world peace. Since then, Mr. Kim seemed to heed Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s admonitions; as recently as October, the North reportedly assured China it would not conduct nuclear tests. Partly because of that, Beijing sent a senior Chinese official to a parade in the North\xe2\x80\x99s capital, Pyongyang, the first such visit since Mr. Kim took power in 2011.'b'The latest nuclear test drew swift condemnation from the United Nations Security Council, NATO and the European Union, as well as individual countries. 'b'Chinese officials'b' were described as furious.'b'What can be done to back up the tough talk? Even before the latest test, Congress was talking about tightening sanctions on North Korea, which has been under American and United Nations penalties for years. Unilateral American action is not enough. China claims it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the kind of power over North Korea that many think, but the fact is that it has more than anybody else and is uniquely positioned to pressure Mr. Kim and his regime, including by interrupting trade flows.'b'China is understandably concerned that really tough economic penalties would cause people to flee North Korea for China. But even smaller gestures like preventing Mr. Kim and his friends from importing whiskey and other luxury goods might have an impact. Peacefully helping to solve the North Korean nuclear threat is an important test of China\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations to be a world leader.'b'Since an agreement with the United States collapsed in 'b'2'b'002, negotiations with North Korea on the nuclear issues have gone nowhere, in part because of American demands that the North agree first that the outcome would be nuclear disarmament. There is no sign Mr. Kim has any interest in negotiating away his nuclear weapons, his only real bargaining chip. But persuading Iran to negotiate on its nuclear program also looked like a pipe dream until creative diplomacy made it happen. The current approach with North Korea certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t working.'b'Talk to members of Congress as they retire after years in the Capitol and a disturbing thread runs through their adieus that has nothing to do with serving the people \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the people. Far from it: It\xe2\x80\x99s more about how happy they are at having no further obligation to romance the donors \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the campaign donors. Departing lawmakers can hardly contain their joy at leaving behind the job\xe2\x80\x99s awful necessity of darting from the Capitol day in and day out to cubbyholed precincts down the block known as \xe2\x80\x9ccall rooms,\xe2\x80\x9d where they beg shamelessly for campaign money to keep their political careers going.'b'The law forbids incumbents from soliciting inside their Capitol offices, so they indulge an elaborate pretense that seeking electioneering money at a nearby party headquarters or a colleague\xe2\x80\x99s townhouse is a convincingly less grubby way of wooing donors hoping for favors.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s horrific,\xe2\x80\x9d Representative Steve Israel of New York admitted this week in 'b'announcing his retirement'b' after eight terms. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I can spend another day in another call room making another call begging for money,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He estimated he has spent 4,200 hours in call rooms, plus 1,600 more at fund-raising dinners, raising $20 million in donations. Plus untold multimillions more in his time running the campaign machine of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.'b'Money grubbing is so relentless for both parties that a Democratic directive for arriving freshmen members that surfaced in 'b'The Huffington Post'b' two years ago candidly advised them to devote four hours of each working day to \xe2\x80\x9ccall time\xe2\x80\x9d if they entertained hopes for re-election \xe2\x80\x94 as opposed to three to four hours for the actual job of lawmaking. Members are regularly seen leaving the Capitol after a vote to put in more call time, as if feeding gluttonous parking meters.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery hour a member of Congress spends on call time is an hour less spent on critical issues,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Israel regretfully noted, arguing that this is the ultimate case for the public financing of federal elections and for full disclosure of well-heeled donors.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen I decided to resign, the first group I called were my donors, to give them the good news that I no longer would be begging them for money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Israel, a published writer who plans to satirize the degrading process in his next novel.'b'President Obama shed tears on Tuesday as he called for 'b'new gun safety measures'b', and some critics perceived weakness or wimpishness. Really? On the contrary, we should all be in tears that 225,000 Americans have already died of gun violence in his seven years in office.'b'The shame is not a president weeping a bit, but that he has not been able to prevent roughly as many people dying of guns in America on his watch as have been 'b'killed in the Syrian civil war'b' (where estimates range from fewer than 200,000 to more than 300,000). Yes, the American gun toll includes suicides and, yes, Syria is a smaller country, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a cry that a \xe2\x80\x9cpeaceful\xe2\x80\x9d America during Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tenure has lost roughly as many lives to gunfire as Syria has in civil war.'b'Ted Cruz responded to the president\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions with 'b'a web page'b' showing a scowling Obama in a helmet, looking like a jackbooted thug staging a home invasion, with the warning, \xe2\x80\x9cObama wants your guns.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Chris Christie protested'b' that Obama was behaving like a \xe2\x80\x9cpetulant child.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Jeb Bush decried'b' Obama\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgun-grabbing agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Donald Trump warned'b' that Obama was moving toward banning guns. The upshot of all this scaremongering will be more Americans 'b'rushing out to buy firearms'b'.'b'Look, let\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledge that liberals have not handled gun issues well over the years. Liberals often antagonize gun owners by coming across as patronizing or insulting \xe2\x80\x94 as well as spectacularly unknowledgeable about the guns they seek to regulate. But on the basic question of whether more guns create more safety or more risk, the evidence seems clear: Most gun owners use firearms responsibly, but with more guns there are more tragedies.'b'Exclude guns and the U.S. has a rate for many violent crimes similar to that of other rich countries. But because we have 300 million guns sloshing around, some in the hands of high-risk individuals, we have a gun homicide rate that is about 'b'20 times that of Australia'b' (which cracked down on guns after a mass shooting there).'b'Gun advocates say criminals will always have guns, so regulations make no difference. But increasingly we have evidence that this is wrong.'b'The states with the most restrictive gun laws 'b'have the lowest gun death rates'b' (including suicides). Take Massachusetts and New York, which have some of the tightest gun restrictions in America; they have 'b'three or four gun deaths per 100,000'b' inhabitants per year. At the other extreme, two of the states with the most permissive gun regulations are Alaska and Louisiana, and both have gun death rates about five times as high: more than 19 per 100,000 inhabitants.'b'Republican presidential candidates should look at the natural experiment that occurred when Missouri eased restrictions on buying handguns. The result was a 'b'25 percent rise'b' in the firearm homicide rate, according to 'b'a study'b' in the Journal of Urban Health.'b'In contrast, Connecticut tightened regulations on buying handguns, and gun homicides there fell by 40 percent, according to the American Journal of Public Health.'b'This is not to say that regulations always work, or that fixing the problem is simple. Daniel W. Webster of Johns Hopkins University cites research that keeping guns from people with past convictions for domestic violence doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make much of a difference. But blocking access to guns by people subject to current domestic violence restraining orders does reduce killings of intimate partners.'b'We need an evidence-driven public health approach, 'b'modeled on our highly successful regulation of cars'b' to reduce auto deaths. That\xe2\x80\x99s the approach the Obama executive actions pursue. Republicans have said for years that we should focus on enforcing existing laws. That\xe2\x80\x99s what Obama is doing.'b'Likewise, Obama is pushing to investigate the feasibility of 'b'smart guns'b' that operate with a fingerprint or a PIN. This may or may not work, but it\xe2\x80\x99s worth a try in a nation where perhaps 300,000 guns are stolen annually. A toddler in America shoots someone on average 'b'once a week'b' because guns are so easy to pick up and fire. If our cellphones can be made to work only with a PIN, it\xe2\x80\x99s crazy that anyone can use a stolen assault rifle.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no magic wand to solve gun violence in America, but neither is it immutable fate that 32,000 Americans die from firearms each year. We know from the experience of states like Connecticut and Missouri that sensible regulations save lives. And why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we want to keep guns from men subject to domestic violence restraining orders if the result is fewer women murdered by jilted boyfriends?'b'The Republican presidential candidates are on the wrong side of history here. While even Republican voters overwhelmingly say in polls that they 'b'favor sensible steps'b' like universal background checks, the Republican candidates are politicizing what should be a public health issue, and they are scaring Americans into buying more guns, which magnifies the problem and causes more carnage.'b'IT wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that a man named Joshua Braam, who died in November in Muskego, Wis., at the age of 36, didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the engaging \xe2\x80\x9clives they lived\xe2\x80\x9d lists that appeared at year\xe2\x80\x99s end. The life he lived was constricted in the extreme. A series of savage beatings by his father, who had obtained custody after a divorce and whose history of abuse had been reported to the local child welfare authorities to no avail, left Joshua comatose and permanently brain damaged at the age of 4. At 12, he was adopted by Richard and Ginger Braam, who cared for him for the rest of his life.'b'His biological mother, acting on his behalf, sued the Winnebago County, Wis., Department of Social Services for depriving Joshua of the \xe2\x80\x9cliberty\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of that claim, in a 1989 opinion written by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, provoked Justice Harry A. Blackmun to exclaim in dissent: \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Joshua!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve offered enough clues here to enable readers familiar with constitutional law to guess the name that Joshua Braam received at birth. As Joshua DeShaney, he was the nominal plaintiff in the case that led to one of the uglier and most consequential decisions of the Rehnquist court, 'b'DeShaney v. Winnebago County Department of Social Services'b'. For readers who don\xe2\x80\x99t know the case, I\xe2\x80\x99ll describe it here both because it continues to define an important part of our constitutional landscape and because, as the seasonal remembrances wind down, Joshua DeShaney Braam\xe2\x80\x99s unsought role in a Supreme Court decision that limited government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to its citizens shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go unmarked.'b'Chief Justice Rehnquist\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the 6-3 majority took the narrowest possible view of the facts in holding that the county agency, despite its employees\xe2\x80\x99 absolute knowledge of the threat that Randy DeShaney posed to his son\xe2\x80\x99s welfare, breached no constitutional duty to Joshua. More than a year before the final beating, the boy was hospitalized with suspicious injuries, but a \xe2\x80\x9cchild protection team\xe2\x80\x9d assigned to look into the situation quickly returned him to his father. Other emergency room visits followed. County social workers visited the home 20 times, taking notes but no action on occasions when the father said the boy was too sick to see them.'b'Chief Justice Rehnquist couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get past the fact that the actual injuries were inflicted not by government agents but by a private person. (The father was prosecuted, convicted and served a brief prison sentence.) \xe2\x80\x9cNothing in the language of the Due Process Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d the chief justice wrote, \xe2\x80\x9crequires the state to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens against invasion by private actors.\xe2\x80\x9d The opinion continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Clause is phrased as a limitation on the state\xe2\x80\x99s power to act, not as a guarantee of certain minimal levels of safety and security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was true, the chief justice acknowledged, that the court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents imposed a degree of government accountability for the welfare of people held in custody, in prison or other government-run institutions. But these precedents offered \xe2\x80\x9cno help,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; Joshua was at home, not in government custody, at the time of his injuries. \xe2\x80\x9cThat the state once took temporary custody of Joshua does not alter the analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Justice Rehnquist wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cfor when it returned him to his father\xe2\x80\x99s custody, it placed him in no worse position than that in which he would have been had it not acted at all; the state does not become the permanent guarantor of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s safety by having once offered him shelter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I found those words chilling when I first read them, and I find them, if anything, even more chilling today, knowing the impact the DeShaney decision has had in the intervening decades. The decision was far from the court\xe2\x80\x99s first to observe that the Constitution provides only \xe2\x80\x9cnegative rights\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 protections against government intrusions of various sorts \xe2\x80\x94 while failing to establish \xe2\x80\x9cpositive rights\xe2\x80\x9d to education, employment, health and safety, and so on. (The chief justice cited a 1980 case, 'b'Harris v. McRae'b', which held that the government has no obligation to pay for poor women\xe2\x80\x99s abortions despite paying for other medical services.) But the decision made the positive-versus-negative dichotomy more concrete than before, and applied it to the facts of the case in a way that was both wooden and unnecessary.'b'As Justice William J. Brennan Jr. pointed out in a dissenting opinion that Justices Blackmun and Thurgood Marshall joined, it was the state that \xe2\x80\x9cestablished a child-welfare system specifically designed to help children like Joshua.\xe2\x80\x9d When the sole agency assigned by Wisconsin law to protect children failed to do its job, Justice Brennan wrote, the state \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively confined Joshua DeShaney within the walls of Randy DeShaney\xe2\x80\x99s violent home.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s opinion construes the Due Process Clause to permit a state to displace private sources of protection, and then, at the critical moment, to shrug its shoulders and turn away from the harm that it has promised to try to prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s separate dissenting opinion \xe2\x80\x94 his cry of \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Joshua!\xe2\x80\x9d and his declaration that \xe2\x80\x9ccompassion need not be exiled from the province of judging\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 for which the DeShaney decision is most noted today. The academic literature has not treated Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s dissent kindly. One law professor, Laura Krugman Ray, 'b'referred to it'b' as \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutional emotionalism,\xe2\x80\x9d the product of \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandable but undisciplined sympathy.\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Richard A. Posner pronounced it \xe2\x80\x9cmaudlin.\xe2\x80\x9d It was, in any event, the unadulterated work of the justice himself; the case file in Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s papers at the Library of Congress contains the \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Joshua!\xe2\x80\x9d passage written in his hand on a sheet of lined paper.'b'All these years later, the decision continues to immunize government from the kind of accountability that common sense and justice would seem to require. A Colorado woman, Jessica Gonzales, tried to steer around the DeShaney obstacle in a case she brought against the town of Castle Rock after her estranged husband snatched their three children from her front lawn and murdered them. Ms. Gonzales had obtained a protective order against her husband, but even though she knew he had taken the children and knew where he had gone with them, the police ignored her repeated pleas to find and intercept him. The Supreme Court 'b'ruled in 2005'b' that Ms. Gonzales had no constitutional claim against the police.'b'So Joshua DeShaney Braam leaves a haunting legacy. The court receives regular requests to revisit or modify the decision, and turns the cases down without comment. For several years after the decision, I kept track of each new appeal that invited the justices to change course, but eventually, I abandoned the project. I can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine the Roberts court revisiting the case.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d like to end this first column of the new year on a more uplifting note. Along with millions of others, I recently received the annual form letter from the Social Security Administration that contained the usual information about anticipated benefits and adjustments. Skimming through the letter, I stopped on page seven at the following paragraph:'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Benefits for Same-Sex Couples: 'b'A recent Supreme Court decision provides nationwide recognition of same-sex couples\xe2\x80\x99 marriages. We encourage people to contact us to find out if they or their children are entitled to Social Security benefits or eligible for a different benefit amount. Visit www.socialsecurity.gov/same-sexcouples/ to learn more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was it. That was the government speaking: no shouting from the rooftops, no jargon, no red tape. Just three simple English sentences emerging from the bowels of the bureaucracy to render what was nearly unthinkable not so long ago into ordinary American life.'b'In its very simplicity, the paragraph was a fitting coda to a year in which the court added a remarkable chapter to the continuing story of human freedom and dignity. Happy new year.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk for a minute about Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump.'b'Both of them were in New York this week. Sanders made a speech about Wall Street to a large and boisterous crowd. They cheered his idea of taxing financial transactions and using the money to make public college tuition free. They booed Wall Street executive bonuses, and loudly joined in to finish some of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s sentences. (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress does not regulate Wall Street \xe2\x80\xa6 WALL STREET REGULATES CONGRESS!\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSecond-biggest crowds, in all fairness,\xe2\x80\x9d said Trump at a meeting Wednesday with The Times editorial board. He added, of course, that his were way, way, way bigger.'b'Both men\xe2\x80\x99s campaigns are about outrage. Sanders wants the country to rise up against the special privileges that keep making the richest 1 percent richer. Trump rocketed to the top of the polls by railing about illegal immigrants. The saddest thing about this presidential race so far is that the Trump approach has gotten way more attention.'b'To be honest, Donald Trump as a presidential candidate is fascinating, in a perverse way. The effect is sort of like being at a cocktail party listening while a half-tipsy celebrity blathers on about his stupid co-star and the way the Academy Awards are fixed. Trump doesn\xe2\x80\x99t drink, but his speeches do have that sloppy off-the-cuff quality. He\xe2\x80\x99ll start to talk about an issue and then abruptly announce: \xe2\x80\x9cSo who knows? It\xe2\x80\x99s a theory.\xe2\x80\x9d Then he boasts about his polls. (\xe2\x80\x9cI could talk about these suckers all night long.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s something a little refreshing in a candidate who does all his bragging up front. And let\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledge that the number of typical American voters who want to listen to a call for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act is not as large as the number who want to hear Trump rant against environmental regulations by describing his affinity for hair spray.'b'But Sanders has such better villains. In his 'b'Wall Street speech'b', he talked about businessmen who get away with the financial equivalent of murder. Wachovia, an American bank later acquired by Wells Fargo, \xe2\x80\x9caided Mexican drug cartels,\xe2\x80\x9d Sanders said, by laundering billions of dollars in their cash. \xe2\x80\x9cYet the total fine for this offense was less than 2 percent of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s $12.3 billion profit \xe2\x80\xa6 and no one went to jail. No one went to jail.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That seems a lot more outrageous than Mexican workers sneaking across the border \xe2\x80\x94 even the ones who are portrayed, in 'b'Trump\xe2\x80\x99s TV ad'b', by a film clip of Africans trying to fling themselves across a fence out of Morocco. (Hard to believe that less than two years ago, 'b'I was making fun'b' of a candidate for the Senate who ran an ad in which an office worker in South Dakota was impersonated by a French model. We\xe2\x80\x99ve come so far.)'b'Maybe the problem with Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s speech was that after he warned Wall Street and corporate America \xe2\x80\x9cif you do not end your greed, we will end it for you,\xe2\x80\x9d he seemed to feel compelled to say how he would do that. Which did require some discussion of the Federal Reserve and banking regulation.'b'Trump seems to feel absolutely no compunction to explain how anything would work. His defense program is basically, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to make our military really, really, really strong.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s going to get rid of all the illegal immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 the actual procedure for making this happen is hazy \xe2\x80\x94 and then force the Mexican government to pay for that wall. (\xe2\x80\x9cTrust me, Mexico will pay.\xe2\x80\x9d) And he\xe2\x80\x99s going to reduce the trade deficit with China (\xe2\x80\x9cthe single greatest theft in the history of the world \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d). At the editorial board meeting, Trump said he\xe2\x80\x99d use his stupendous deal-making powers to force the Chinese to raise the value of their currency.'b'And what if the Chinese don\xe2\x80\x99t comply? Trump said he\xe2\x80\x99d impose a tariff. How much of a tariff? Maybe 45 percent.'b'This seemed like a new number. A few years back, Trump called for a 25 percent tariff on Chinese goods, and early in the campaign he mentioned a 35 percent tax on Mexican-built cars. Do you think he\xe2\x80\x99s been rerunning the figures during campaign flights? Another possible answer would be that he just makes this stuff up as he goes along.'b'There is, Trump says, \xe2\x80\x9ca great anger out there. \xe2\x80\xa6 A lot of people say that my campaign has picked up on that, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t do that intentionally.\xe2\x80\x9d Perhaps that\xe2\x80\x99s true, in the sense that he never sat down and wrote out an Anger Plan. He just keeps repeating whatever seems to get a rise out of his listeners. He always was a great marketer.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not all that stunning that he\xe2\x80\x99s so far ahead in the national polls, given the quality of the Republican competition. But it\xe2\x80\x99s depressing that he\xe2\x80\x99s cornered the anger franchise when his targets exclude America\xe2\x80\x99s own wealthy and powerful.'b'Donald Trump isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the Republican nominee.'b'Six months ago, that was a truism. Three months ago, it was the conventional wisdom. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s an assertion that inspires sympathetic glances, the kind you get when you tell friends that you think your new personal-investment strategy is sure to beat the market.'b''b'I know you really 'b'want 'b'that to be true'b', the glances say, 'b'but you just might be kidding yourself.'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why people are starting to think this way. Trump has led the national polls since last summer, and not by a little. Apart from the Ben Carson bubble, nothing has dented his advantage: It\xe2\x80\x99s actually expanded over the last month, and nobody in the G.O.P. seems to have a coherent plan to cut into his support.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBased on polling data,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam Wang of the Princeton Election Consortium 'b'wrote this week'b', \xe2\x80\x9cDonald Trump is in as strong a position to get his party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination as Hillary Clinton in 2016, George W. Bush in 2000, or Al Gore in 2000.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTRUTH BOMB,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote 'b'Politico\xe2\x80\x99s Mike Allen'b', the insider\xe2\x80\x99s insider. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you think voters will suddenly get serious \xe2\x80\x94 and that Trump is a \xe2\x80\x98lampshade candidate\xe2\x80\x99 who\xe2\x80\x99ll eventually wear out his welcome \xe2\x80\x94 you\xe2\x80\x99re running out of time to be right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Against this combination of stable poll numbers and sands running through the primary-season hourglass, what do Trump skeptics have to offer?'b'One answer comes from 'b'Ezra Klein of Vox'b', who quotes Joe Trippi, Howard Dean\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager in 2004, explaining why his candidate\xe2\x80\x99s Trump-like lead evaporated so quickly once the actual voting started: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople get more pragmatic the closer they get to an actual vote.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Riffing on this point, Klein writes:'b'Now I agree with Klein that this sudden-decline scenario is very plausible. But as 'b'someone who recently confessed'b' to having dramatically underestimated Trump\xe2\x80\x99s political talents, I think it\xe2\x80\x99s worth trying to do a little better, and describe how Trump could fail to get the Republican nomination even if he 'b'doesn\xe2\x80\x99t'b' have a Dean-like plunge.'b'Suppose that his support is more robust than Dean\xe2\x80\x99s, suppose that the Trump constituency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give a fig about pragmatism. How does Trump lose then?'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how. Yes, Trump leads all the national polls, and he keeps busting through what look like ceilings. But (unlike Dean) he 'b'doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lead in Iowa'b', and his ceiling there looks very stable: He\xe2\x80\x99s been hovering around 25 percent since September, and he\xe2\x80\x99s never broken 30 percent.'b'He does lead in New Hampshire, but there, too, his poll numbers have been relatively flat since August, and he tops out around 30 percent. Likewise South Carolina, where his polling has hovered in the 30 percent to 35 percent range since he grabbed the spotlight last summer.'b'There is no credible scenario in which a consistent 30 percent of the vote will deliver the delegates required to be the Republican nominee. So for Trump to lose, he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually have to collapse; he just has to fail to expand his support. And in the states where candidates are actually campaigning, voters are paying the most attention, and the polling screens for likely voters are tightening, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t expanded his support meaningfully since he first climbed into the lead.'b'Foolish pundit that I may be, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he will. Instead, I think that Ted Cruz will continue to consolidate evangelicals as Ben Carson fades, and someone (probably Marco Rubio) will eventually consolidate the moderate-conservative vote \xe2\x80\x94 which is currently splintered among five candidates in New Hampshire, but which if it 'b'were'b' consolidated would very easily beat Trump\xe2\x80\x99s total in that state.'b'At which point \xe2\x80\x94 again, assuming that Trump doesn\xe2\x80\x99t fade or collapse \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99ll have a three-way race, one in which the Donald could still win some states, could still pile up delegates, could even have a chance of pushing the race all the way to the convention \xe2\x80\x94 but would not, could not, emerge as the nominee.'b'Think about it this way: It now looks very likely that Cruz will beat Trump in Iowa, at which point Carson\xe2\x80\x99s campaign will be pretty much finished, and Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum will disappear \xe2\x80\x94 and with Cruz suddenly ascendant, he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to pick up their supporters, pushing him up to Trump-like levels in the national polls.'b'Once that happens, would you really bet on Trump to beat Cruz in many of the evangelical-heavy Southern states that vote in late February or early March? In Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s own state of Texas? That seems unlikely.'b'And Trump has 'b'more support in the South'b' than he does in the high plains or Mountain West. So to survive a Cruz ascendancy among evangelicals, he would need to dominate in states like New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Florida.'b'But if we treat New Hampshire as a plausible template for outcomes in those states, then Trump needs Rubio and Chris Christie and Jeb Bush to all stay in the race 'b'and'b' for all of them to keep winning exactly 15 percent of the vote; then and only then would his 30 percent be sufficient to prevail.'b'That seems less than unlikely, indeed nearly impossible. At best, two of those three men will be left as viable candidates after New Hampshire, and the Republican establishment (such as it is) will simply have to pick one to rally behind by the end of March. The complexion of the race will be different if Christie somehow shoulders past Rubio \xe2\x80\x94 but either one of them should be capable of stopping Trump from sweeping the blue and purple states he needs.'b'Which is not to say that in that scenario the establishment candidate will win. Trump is a genuinely disruptive force, and if his coalition holds together it could make genuinely unlikely outcomes \xe2\x80\x94 Cruz as the most right-wing nominee since Barry Goldwater, a battle on the convention floor \xe2\x80\x94 far more plausible than they would have been without him.'b'But disruption doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get you to 'b'the 1,236 delegates'b' required for the nomination. 'b'Loki does not rule in Asgard'b'. And Donald Trump isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be the Republican nominee.'b'On Tuesday, in an emotionally charged speech, President Obama 'b'announced a series of relatively modest executive orders'b' to aid in preventing guns from getting into the wrong hands.'b'The proposal would expand background checks through a clarification of existing regulations, increase funding for mental health care, and promote the development of smart guns.'b'The speech itself accomplished more than the executive actions are likely to accomplish. Viewed in political terms, the president injected this issue more firmly into the national debate as only a president can. Because a sitting president, even an exiting one, is always in the next presidential race: Other candidates are either running, at least in part, against his legacy or to extend it.'b'But there is one point that I was aching to hear articulated that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t covered in the president\xe2\x80\x99s speech, and is rarely mentioned in discussions about gun regulations: How our response to gun regulations is not now, nor has ever been, wholly ideological but is also ethnocentric and class-based.'b'I firmly believe that part of the current intransigence is because those gun homicides disproportionately affect poor minorities. (Gun suicides disproportionately affect white people.) Indeed, the only time that national figures seem to get fully engaged is in the wake of mass shootings that involve white people, either as shooters or victims.'b'Indeed, you have to explore the history of gun regulations to fully appreciate its racial dimensions.'b'In 2011, Adam Winkler spoke about his book \xe2\x80\x9cGun Fight,\xe2\x80\x9d and the origins of gun control, saying, according to The Wall Street Journal:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African-Americans, because they would rise up and revolt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He continued:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe KKK began as a gun-control organization. Before the Civil War, blacks were never allowed to own guns. During the Civil War, blacks kept guns for the first time \xe2\x80\x94 either they served in the Union army and they were allowed to keep their guns, or they buy guns on the open market where for the first time there\xe2\x80\x99s hundreds of thousands of guns flooding the marketplace after the war ends. So they arm up because they know who they\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with in the South. White racists do things like pass laws to disarm them, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not really going to work. So they form these racist posses all over the South to go out at night in large groups to terrorize blacks and take those guns away. If blacks were disarmed, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t fight back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was about white terror.'b'After Prohibition and the Depression gave rise to gangsters and outlaws who posed a threat to white America\xe2\x80\x99s sense of safety, the Firearms Act of 1934 was passed. As the gun law expert Robert Spitzer, of the State University of New York at Cortland, 'b'told NPR'b' in 2013, the law required machine gun owners to pay a hefty tax, be fingerprinted and be listed on a national registry; as a result, sales of machine guns plummeted.'b'Again, white terror, but this time from other white people.'b'America was again stirred to action on gun control when, in 1967, armed members of the Black Panthers entered a largely white place of power \xe2\x80\x94 the California State Legislature. As The Times\xe2\x80\x99s film critic 'b'A. O. Scott noted in his review'b' of Stanley Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating documentary \xe2\x80\x9cThe Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution\xe2\x80\x9d:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a group of Panthers demonstrated at the Statehouse in Sacramento carrying loaded rifles and shotguns, the organization drew national news attention and (at least temporarily) rallied many political conservatives, including Gov. Ronald Reagan, to the cause of 'b'gun control'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Reagan said of the Panthers\xe2\x80\x99 action at the time:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that loaded guns is the way to solve a problem that should be solved between people of good will. And anyone who would approve of this kind of demonstration must be out of their mind.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(This episode stands in stark contrast to the armed white men now occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.)'b'In response to the Panthers, the California legislature passed and Reagan signed the Mulford Act, which banned the open carry of firearms in the state. The N.R.A. supported the measure. The bill\xe2\x80\x99s author, Don Mulford, 'b'said at the time'b', \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to protect society from nuts with guns.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Edward Wyckoff Williams even 'b'claimed in The Root'b' in 2013 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe NRA actually helped craft similar legislation in states across the country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The year after the Mulford Act, the federal Gun Control Act of 1968 was passed.'b'Once again, white terror.'b'In recent decades, as the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s political power has grown, it has also taken on more of an absolutist position against any new regulations and politicians largely have bowed to the group\xe2\x80\x99s stance.'b'Two notable exceptions were the 1993 Brady Bill requiring background checks for gun purchase and the assault weapons ban of 1994 \xe2\x80\x94 which has since expired \xe2\x80\x94 both of which were signed by Bill Clinton.'b'But in addition to the N.R.A.\xe2\x80\x99s influence, the face of homicides is becoming increasingly black and poor \xe2\x80\x94 two groups we have traditionally marginalized and ignored.'b'As Richard V. Reeves and Sarah Holmes of the Brookings Institution 'b'pointed out last month'b', 77 percent of white gun deaths are suicides while 82 percent of black gun deaths are homicides.'b'But even then, it\xe2\x80\x99s not the whole of the black population at risk of these homicides.'b'As William J. Wilson, also of Brookings, 'b' wrote last month'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSegregation by income amplifies segregation by race, leaving low-income blacks clustered in neighborhoods that feature disadvantages along several dimensions, including exposure to violent crime. As a result, the divide within the black community has widened sharply. In 1978, poor blacks aged twelve and over were only marginally more likely than affluent blacks to be violent crime victims \xe2\x80\x94 around forty-five and thirty-eight per 1000 individuals respectively. However, by 2008, poor blacks were far more likely to be violent crime victims \xe2\x80\x94 about seventy-five per 1000 \xe2\x80\x94 while affluent blacks were far 'b'less'b' likely to be victims of violent crime \xe2\x80\x94 about twenty-three per 1000, according to Hochschild and Weaver.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is now precious little political will to further inhibit the largely white gun-buying population \xe2\x80\x94 'b'according to the Pew Research Center'b', whites are twice as likely as blacks or Hispanics to have a gun in the home \xe2\x80\x94 in order to help reduce the scourge of homicides among poor black people, particularly when the shooters are often black themselves. These killings are simply attributed to racial culture rather than to the complicated interplay between poverty, crime and gun culture.'b'And, since the federal government wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do enough to deal with this problem, local municipalities have employed other methods to get guns \xe2\x80\x94 many of them illegal \xe2\x80\x94 out of the hands of criminals. But those efforts, such as New York City\xe2\x80\x99s morally indefensible racial dragnet program called stop-and-frisk, did as much damage as good in the black communities.'b'Lawmakers refused to act, and local politicians and police departments overreacted. Poor black people were caught in the middle.'b'That, alas, is less about a response to white terror, than a nonresponse to black pain.'b'It is a familiar claim by many Second Amendment defenders \xe2\x80\x94 and, during the Obama administration, an increasingly popular one \xe2\x80\x94 that unfettered gun rights are necessary to protect American citizens against the threat of a tyrannical government.'b'In addition to being 'b'a misreading of history'b', the claim is amusing hyperbole to those who have suffered under real-life tyrants. But 'b'this week\xe2\x80\x99s armed standoff'b' at a federal wildlife sanctuary in eastern Oregon is showing how far a small, determined band of antigovernment zealots with lots of big guns will go to make their potentially deadly point.'b'Styling themselves as a militia, the group hijacked a peaceful protest over five-year prison sentences a federal court had imposed on two local ranchers for setting fires on federal land. Led by a man named Ammon Bundy \xe2\x80\x94 whose father, Cliven, instigated his own armed confrontation with federal authorities over cattle ranching in Nevada in 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 this hyperweaponized posse rolled into town and seized administrative buildings at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge on Saturday. Mr. Bundy 'b'said'b' they are willing to stay for \xe2\x80\x9cas long as necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cif force is used against us, we would defend ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The occupation is the latest outgrowth of a 'b'long-running movement'b' by some ranchers and farmers who believe the federal government controls far too much land in Oregon, Nevada and other Western states. Mr. Bundy and his gun-toting comrades argue that a century of federal policies has 'b'driven many ranchers into poverty'b' and destroyed the rural economy.'b'This is mostly nonsense. As part of its congressional mandate to balance commercial and environmental concerns, including conservation, the federal government imposes reasonable rules on how public land can be used for mining, logging and ranching. On the whole Washington has been a 'b'benevolent, even generous landlord'b'.'b'There may be a good argument that the two ranchers in this case, Dwight Hammond and his son, Steven, were 'b'punished unreasonably harshly'b' for their crimes. But the way to have this argument is through peaceful means, such as the original protesters were doing, or as the Hammonds themselves chose to do \xe2\x80\x94 by reporting to prison and asking President Obama for clemency. Every day, citizens around the country sue or otherwise challenge the government over alleged violations of the law or the Constitution, and they do it without a rifle in their hand.'b'A democracy cannot function any other way. It thrives on principled disagreement, but it withers in the face of a loaded gun.'b'Such dangerous behavior also puts law enforcement in an 'b'impossible position'b': respond with force and people may well die; walk away \xe2\x80\x94 as Bureau of Land Management officials 'b'did with Cliven Bundy'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and the extremists are only 'b'emboldened'b'. (On Monday, 'b'according to'b' The Guardian, federal authorities said they planned to shut off power to the buildings.)'b'Mr. Bundy and his band of militants have made few friends. Local law enforcement 'b'has told them'b' to leave immediately. Many residents, even those who agree that the federal government owns and mismanages too much land, have 'b'strongly rejected'b' Mr. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s gun-happy tactics. The Hammonds\xe2\x80\x99 own lawyer 'b'disassociated his clients'b' from the group. And while years of overheated antigovernment statements from right-wing politicians and media figures have helped to fuel exactly this sort of outburst, it is encouraging that 'b'many on the right'b' have called for the militants to stand down. When Ted Cruz 'b'says'b' you\xe2\x80\x99ve gone too far, it\xe2\x80\x99s worth listening.'b'The simple message Mr. Bundy and his band must hear is this: If everyone with a gripe against the government responded by threatening federal officials with weapons, America would no longer be a nation governed by the rule of law. Their grievances, like everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s, can be addressed. But not before they put down the guns.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Better Standard for the Use of Deadly Force'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Olevia Boykin, Christopher Desir and Jed Rubenfeld (Op-Ed, Jan. 1):'b'What difference would \xe2\x80\x9ca better standard\xe2\x80\x9d make? It\xe2\x80\x99s not academic mumbo-jumbo; a better standard would save hundreds of American lives a year. About 1,000 lives are lost each year in the United States because of police use of deadly force, while in 'b'places such as England and Germany'b' fewer than 10 are. Why?'b'Training in the use of force is at the heart of police education. Police officers are taught not only that resort to deadly force must be necessary, as the article advocates, but also that it must be 'b'proportionate'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that is, the consequences for the person affected are not out of proportion to the danger averted. Shooting at a fleeing traffic offender, as happens in the United States, is rarely proportionate.'b'JAMES R. MAXEINER'b'Baltimore'b''b'The writer is associate director of the Center for International and Comparative Law, University of Baltimore School of Law.'b''b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'During my career in law enforcement I trained many new hires, made hundreds of arrests and was involved in one on-duty shooting. The writers\xe2\x80\x99 statement that police officers are more likely and quicker to shoot an armed black suspect than an armed white one is offensive. It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of rhetoric that keeps us from having a constructive conversation about the tremendously serious problems facing this country regarding law enforcement and minorities.'b'I do not for a moment deny that racism exists among officers. Racism exists throughout our society. This year brought us sickening examples of apparent murder by cops.

This, if it were true, would be extremely limiting in our current electoral system. Immigration is a political high-wire act for those who support immigrants and a no-brainer, loaded with political currency, if you malign them. O.K., I get that.'b'But immigration is far from a single issue. It\xe2\x80\x99s central to economic policy, national security and humanitarian relief. It\xe2\x80\x99s linked to health care, education and the reunification of families. Latinos know this complexity and thus engage variously with the issues of immigration.'b'Further, immigrants are not strangers or even distant relatives to millions of Latinos. They are part of our families \xe2\x80\x94 children, parents, cousins \xe2\x80\x94 and our neighborhoods in so many ways. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, at least nine million people live in families made up of at least one immigrant and one citizen.

It makes no sense whatsoever, and applying the deduction to a higher wage ceiling would not be an onerous burden on the higher wage earner.'b'Rather than make people work until they are 70 or reduce Social Security benefits or privatize the system, raising the wage ceiling makes perfect sense.'b'JAY THOMAS WATSON'b'Sonoma, Calif.'b'HOUSTON \xe2\x80\x94 IN French, the word \xe2\x80\x9cd\xc3\xa9ch\xc3\xa9ance\xe2\x80\x9d has several meanings, all of them bleak. It can refer to the fall of a civilization, or the degradation of the social fabric. More formally, it means the forfeiture of a right or a possession \xe2\x80\x94 one\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship, for example. All three meanings, carrying echoes of the country\xe2\x80\x99s experience under Vichy, resonate in a political drama unfolding in France.'b'Two weeks ago, the Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, delivered a stunning blow to the French revolutionary ideal that citizenship is no less indivisible than the republic itself. He announced at a news conference that his government would introduce legislation this year to amend the Constitution to allow the government to strip French citizenship from individuals who are found guilty of acts of terrorism \xe2\x80\x94 but only if they are among the three million French citizens who hold dual nationality.'b'Mr. Valls has the support of the leading conservative parties, the Republicans and the xenophobic National Front, but his own party exploded.'b'Speaking for several dozen fellow deputies, Beno\xc3\xaet Hamon, a former government minister, described the measure as \xe2\x80\x9cinspired and supported by the National Front.\xe2\x80\x9d Among the Socialists\xe2\x80\x99 erstwhile allies on the left, the outrage was even greater. Jean-Luc M\xc3\xa9lenchon, leader of the Left Party, denounced the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete moral d\xc3\xa9ch\xc3\xa9ance\xe2\x80\x9d of the government, while C\xc3\xa9cile Duflot of the Greens called upon \xe2\x80\x9call republican consciences to awaken and refuse to step onto this slippery slope.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The news took even many in the Socialist government by surprise. The day before Mr. Valls\xe2\x80\x99s announcement, the outspoken minister of justice, Christiane Taubira, dismissed the idea of such legislation as null and void. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will fizzle out on its own,\xe2\x80\x9d she assured reporters, a statement echoed by other members of President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle.'b'Skeptical reporters could be forgiven, because the original idea came from Mr. Hollande himself. When he convened both houses of the French Parliament at Versailles three days after the Paris terrorist attacks, he came with three goals: to reassure a shaken nation, reaffirm his personal authority and restrain the right\xe2\x80\x99s ascendancy. In a Gallic variation on the Patriot Act, Mr. Hollande announced not just the extension of the state of emergency and expansion of the state\xe2\x80\x99s ability to gather intelligence, but also the constitutional wrinkle concerning terrorists\xe2\x80\x99 holding dual nationality.'b'At the time, few Socialist politicians, still in shock over events, took that last goal seriously. Mr. Hollande and Mr. Valls had vehemently opposed the same proposal when the previous president, Nicolas Sarkozy, embraced it in 2010. But with the National Front\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic electoral gains in regional elections in December, things seemed to change: Successive polls revealing an overwhelming majority of French in favor of such a law most likely persuaded Mr. Hollande, whose approval ratings remain dismal, to carry out his original promise.'b'Yet for many Socialists, already embittered by his modest efforts to \xe2\x80\x9cliberalize\xe2\x80\x9d the moribund economy, Mr. Hollande was committing both a moral crime and a political blunder. His proposal would in effect create two classes of citizens, the lesser of which would enjoy the rights and duties of citizenship, but with the proviso that they could be legally withdrawn by the state. Hence the explosion of anger when Mr. Valls worried that his Socialist critics had allowed \xe2\x80\x9cgrand values\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9clead them astray.\xe2\x80\x9d Christian Paul spoke for a growing number of Socialist deputies when he replied: \xe2\x80\x9cThose who forget their values lose their honor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Something else has also been forgotten, however. While the question of citizenship is no small matter for any nation, it has a particularly compelling role in French history and identity. The French Revolution invented the modern conception of national citizenship and formalized the ideal of civil equality. Thanks to its revolutionary heritage, France juggles a unique combination of \xe2\x80\x9cjus sanguinis\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 where children inherit their parents\xe2\x80\x99 nationality \xe2\x80\x94 and \xe2\x80\x9cjus soli,\xe2\x80\x9d where the soil one is born on, and not the parents one is born to, determines one\xe2\x80\x99s nationality. (Children born on French soil to foreigners become citizens at age 18, if they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a criminal record and have resided continuously in the country for five years.)'b'This makes perfect sense for a country like France: not only is it a nation of immigrants, but it is also a nation supremely confident in its powers of assimilation. Until now, that is.'b'Mr. Hollande\xe2\x80\x99s decision to hold fast to his presidential word is in fact a confession of weakness, an avowal that France has failed in its republican mission. It also undermines the status of three million Frenchmen and women by adding an asterisk to their status. This step, for some critics, is not unlike stamping the word \xe2\x80\x9cJuif\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cJuive\xe2\x80\x9d on the papers of French Jews under the collaborationist regime of Vichy, not to mention its stripping of citizenship in 1940 from naturalized French Jews.'b'These historical associations will be made in the debates between now and early February, when the government presents its bill to Parliament. Already, the political parties have begun circling around one another. Tasting blood, a vice president of the National Front, Florian Philippot, has demanded that the forfeiture of citizenship be applied to other, unspecified \xe2\x80\x9cgrave crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d not just terrorism. Tacking left, a few Socialists have suggested that this punishment be extended to 'b'all'b' French citizens convicted of terrorism. (This law, however, would collide with a 1961 international convention, signed but never ratified by France, that prohibits the annulment of citizenship if it renders the interested party stateless.)'b'As the debate sharpens over the next few weeks, more than one lawmaker will wonder what the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s founder would make of it. After all, 75 years ago last month Charles de Gaulle, who had left France for England to continue the war against Nazi Germany, was shorn of his French citizenship by Vichy.'b'Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago built his career on the claim that he is at his best in times of crisis. But it will take more than political showmanship to calm the discontent that has roiled the city since November, when a Police Department video showed a white officer executing a black teenager named Laquan McDonald and exposed a cover-up by officers who had been at the scene. Chicagoans were still protesting the McDonald case on Christmas weekend when police officers responding to a domestic dispute killed two more African-Americans, one of whom was a bystander and a mother of five.'b'Public anger was focused on the Police Department. That changed on Monday, when a federal judge ruled that a veteran lawyer for the city had deliberately concealed important evidence in yet another trial about yet another fatal police shooting. The judge, Edmond Chang of United States District Court, also found that the lawyer had lied about his reasons for holding back the information in the wrongful death lawsuit. The case has raised suspicions that the city\xe2\x80\x99s Law Department itself has been soft-pedaling police misconduct cases.'b'The case focused on a 2011 traffic stop during which two officers fired their weapons, killing a black man, Darius Pinex. Mr. Pinex would be alive today had the officers simply checked his license plate number with the dispatcher, who could have told them they had the wrong car. One officer testified at trial that they approached the car with guns drawn because the dispatcher had warned that someone in the car might have a weapon.'b'That was disproved by a recording of the dispatch \xe2\x80\x94 which mentioned no weapon. But a senior Chicago corporation counsel withheld the recording until late in the trial, when it was too late for the Pinex family to make effective use of it. The jury subsequently ruled the shooting justified.'b'The federal judge overturned the verdict and wrote of the city\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, Jordan Marsh: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter hiding the information, despite there being numerous times when the circumstances dictated he say something about it, Marsh said nothing, and even made misleading statements to the court when the issue arose.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He ordered the city and the lawyer to pay attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees for the Pinex family, which could easily amount to several hundred thousand dollars. As 'b'The Chicago Tribune'b' reported this week, this was the second case in less than a year for which Judge Chang ordered a new trial and penalized city lawyers for withholding evidence in a police misconduct case.'b'The judge\xe2\x80\x99s actions, which come in the wake of the McDonald shooting and 'b'damning revelations'b' about the laxness of the police disciplinary system, deepen the impression that city government has been working at several levels to shield officers from accountability. That may require replacing the deeply flawed system of police oversight with something stronger and more transparent. Mr. Emanuel will need to convince Chicagoans that he understands their anger over this issue and that 'b'his promise'b' of \xe2\x80\x9ca historic set of reforms\xe2\x80\x9d becomes a reality.'b'President Obama once 'b'said'b' this about his administration\xe2\x80\x99s deportation priorities: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. That means felons, not families. That means criminals, not children. It means gang members, not moms who are trying to put food on the table for their kids.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Encouraging words, a year ago. But a new year has dawned upon an appalling 'b'campaign of home raids'b' by the Department of Homeland Security to find and deport hundreds of would-be refugees back to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. The targets are those who arrived in a recent surge of people fleeing shockingly high levels of gang and drug violence, hunger and poverty and who offered themselves at the border to the mercy of the United States, but ultimately lost their cases in immigration court.'b'Since New Year\xe2\x80\x99s, the administration has been sending agents into homes to make an example of the offenders and to defend the principle of a secure border. A president who spoke so movingly about the violent gun deaths of children here has taken on the job of sending mothers and children on one-way trips to the deadliest countries in our hemisphere. Mothers and children who pose no threat, actual or imaginable, to our security.'b'The Homeland Security secretary, Jeh Johnson, 'b'said in a statement'b': \xe2\x80\x9cOur borders are not open to illegal migration. If you come here illegally, we will send you back consistent with our laws and values.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cThis should come as no surprise. I have said publicly for months that individuals who constitute enforcement priorities, including families and unaccompanied children, will be removed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no wonder that Donald Trump is applauding the policy, and taking credit for it.'b'But Mr. Johnson is wrong to suggest that frightened Central Americans are a border-security threat. It\xe2\x80\x99s not illegal to go to the border and seek asylum, as these families have. And his defense of our \xe2\x80\x9cvalues\xe2\x80\x9d jarringly sidesteps vital questions \xe2\x80\x94 Why are people fleeing? And if they are desperate to escape their murderous homelands, what is the best response of the United States?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly not home raids that send powerless individuals unjustly back to mortal danger and, as collateral damage, 'b'spread fear and panic'b' in immigrant neighborhoods across the country. The homicidal brutality in Central America has spawned a humanitarian disaster, but the administration has been treating it as a Texas border-security emergency, and a political headache. Perhaps this is why its efforts at deterring the migrant flow have not succeeded. Families have taken the journey anyway, not because they are determined to flout our immigration laws \xe2\x80\x94 but because they want not to be murdered.'b'The administration needs to recognize that this problem cannot be solved in backward fashion. The answer lies not in sitting idly until refugees arrive and greeting them with family prisons and prosecution. It requires addressing the root causes of the bloody violence in the region, and fixing the chaotic, underfunded legal system at the border, where migrants with no money or lawyers \xe2\x80\x94 or with bad lawyers \xe2\x80\x94 confront the infernal complexities of immigration and asylum law, and lose. The administration should have long ago begun building routes of escape for families in danger, with safe havens and in-country screening for those seeking resettlement, in the United States or elsewhere in the region.'b'While federal agents have been knocking on doors and spreading fear, advocacy groups have been scrambling to help the Central Americans. Humanitarian projects like 'b'CARA, 'b'a cooperative effort of legal services organizations, and 'b'Raices'b', which has worked for years with refugees in Central and South Texas, have placed urgent calls for funds and volunteers. Protection, due process and outstretched arms for terrorized families: That\xe2\x80\x99s an approach consistent with America\xe2\x80\x99s laws and values, not agents at the door, on the hunt for mothers and children.'b'DURING nuclear negotiations in 2005, a North Korean diplomat let slip an unexpectedly candid comment, offering valuable insight into his government\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear policy: \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason you attacked Afghanistan is because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have nukes. And look at what happened to Libya. That is why we will never give up ours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'North Korea'b' conducted its fourth nuclear test on Wednesday, claiming that it had detonated a hydrogen bomb. The United States government disputes that, but one thing is clear: North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s leaders still believe that 'b'nuclear weapons'b' will prevent others from attacking them no matter what they do. This is fanciful. What the world needs is reality. North Korea must recognize the limitations and risks of its nuclear program, and the United States must recognize that an American response is necessary.'b'Many serious dangers come with being a nuclear power, and the North Koreans seem to recognize few of them. One is the temptation to transfer weapons, fissile material or technology to other states or terrorist groups. North Korea has a history of selling its traditional weapons systems. But the government must recognize that selling its nuclear technology could compel the United States to respond in ways that would bring an end to nearly 70 years of Communist rule.'b'There are other ways that the nuclear program makes the government less secure. Over the past several years, North Korea has degraded its conventional military capacity in order to pursue nuclear weapons. Under normal circumstances, a weaker North Korean Army would be welcome news to the rest of the world, but with a budding nuclear state it can lead to rapid escalation in the event of a conflict. This could mean either pre-emptive action by the United States, or, if North Korea ever used nuclear weapons, a massive retaliation.'b'The North also mistakenly believes that its nascent nuclear abilities will deter the United States and South Korea from responding if North Korean forces carry out low-level military actions intended to extort food, fuel or other benefits. It is wrong. South Korea and the United States are unlikely to remain passive in response to future violence like the 'b'2010 sinking'b' of a South Korean naval ship.'b'The Obama administration cannot punt to the next administration the problem of North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s growing stockpiles of fissile material, sophisticated weapons designs and long-range delivery ability.'b'No one should take comfort in skepticism about whether Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s test was a success. If North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s burgeoning nuclear weapons stockpile leads it to miscalculate American resolve, there will be horrible consequences. And at that point the whole world will wonder why no nation \xe2\x80\x94 especially the United States \xe2\x80\x94 stopped North Korea before it was too late.'b'A new approach to persuading the North to abandon its nuclear program must focus on asymmetric pressure points. A look at recent history helps to outline such a strategy. In our experience working on North Korea policy, the government in Pyongyang has seemed truly caught off guard only twice: in September 2005 when the Treasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s sanctions led to a freezing of its bank accounts in Macau; and in February 2014 when a 'b'United Nations'b' commission 'b'called for'b' the Security Council to refer the North\xe2\x80\x99s leadership to the International Criminal Court for a long list of crimes against humanity.'b'The United States and the United Nations should immediately increase sanctions. A new Security Council resolution will most likely emerge soon, providing one opportunity for this. Another comes in the form of the presidential executive order created after the cyber attack on Sony Pictures last year. These should include targeted financial sanctions; travel bans and indictments against officials working on the nuclear program, human rights abusers and cyber criminals; as well as secondary sanctions on anyone doing business with North Korean companies.'b'But sanctions are only one part of the strategy. Many observers believe, credibly, that slave labor bankrolls the nuclear weapons program. The United Nations must also continue to hold individuals in the government directly accountable for crimes against humanity, and all countries, including 'b'China'b' and Russia, should be pressured to stop accepting North Korean laborers.'b'Even if China\xe2\x80\x99s government has made clear that it is unhappy with North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s behavior, Beijing won\xe2\x80\x99t abandon its ally anytime soon. But the United States can \xe2\x80\x94 and should \xe2\x80\x94 push for Beijing to dial back its support. China could instruct Chinese companies to curtail business with North Korea, and the government could reject any calls from North Korea for new economic projects until the government returned to negotiations. China could also agree to not obstruct any Security Council discussions on human rights abuses in the North. Washington must frame cooperation on North Korea as a cornerstone of United States-China relations.'b'North Korea thinks that nuclear weapons make it more secure. That\xe2\x80\x99s wrong. North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s only path away from isolation and insecurity will require negotiation on all issues, including security, human rights and economics. In order to help it understand this, the United States must use the nuclear test Wednesday to force the North back to the table.'b'Most of the ranchers I know are decent folks, men and women of a few well-chosen words, slow to rouse, distrustful of a show horse on four legs or two. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the armed gang who seized an Oregon bird sanctuary \xe2\x80\x94 Y\xe2\x80\x99all Qaeda, as the twittersphere has dubbed them.'b'The leader, Ammon Bundy, is the son of Cliven Bundy, the deadbeat rancher and Fox News hero who still owes more than $1 million in unpaid grazing fees.

The only thing Bundy and his fellow burglars have accomplished thus far is to leave behind enough evidence for prosecutors to file numerous criminal charges against them.'b'But this Gang That Can\xe2\x80\x99t Protest Straight is not far removed from a better-dressed crowd in Congress pushing for radical change in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s public land endowment.

In truth, an overwhelming majority of Westerners enjoy their public lands for all the things that the federal government protects for them \xe2\x80\x94 recreation, wildlife, history, open space, clean water.'b'The 47 million bird watchers in this country spend $40 billion a year to follow creatures whose lives are dependent on federal wildlife refuges. Imagine if a bunch of birders, lathered in sunscreen, their heads covered in floppy hats, took over a federal facility to protest the innumerable predations of wildlife habitat by cattle ranchers.'b'Birders generate 660,000 jobs, through trips and retail sales, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. By contrast, grazing allotments on federal public land number a bit more than 20,000. For those ranchers, the deal is a steal \xe2\x80\x94 about 90 percent cheaper than the market rate on private land in 16 Western states. We subsidize the ranchers, while a majority of our public land users generate hundreds of thousands of jobs, and never threaten to kill a forest ranger.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why only a handful of ranchers \xe2\x80\x94 Cliven Bundy being the best-known culprit \xe2\x80\x94 refuse to pay what most others do. But why, then, the push to privatize our great open spaces? It goes back to power.'b'Teddy Roosevelt framed the struggle in terms of the people against the exploiters. It was Roosevelt who created the wildlife refuge in Oregon, angering white squatters. The Supreme Court twice upheld the right of the government to protect the high desert.'b'The extremists, in Congress and the snows of Oregon, want to return to a 19'b''b'th century world where blunt force \xe2\x80\x94 against Indians, wildlife, the public good \xe2\x80\x94 prevails. It\xe2\x80\x99s a fantasy, costumed in western wear, except that the guns are real.'b'Last month Fox News 'b'released a poll'b' showing Hillary Clinton leading Bernie Sanders in Iowa by 14 points. But the amazing part of the poll was the generation gap. Among likely caucusgoers under 45, Sanders was crushing Clinton 56 to 34 percent. Among the older voters, Clinton was leading 59 to 24.'b'When you look at numbers like that you get the impression that this millennial generation, having endured the financial crash and stagnant wages, is ready to lead a big leftward push.'b'Indeed, a 'b'Harvard Institute of Politics poll'b' of Americans 18 to 29 found that 56 percent want a Democrat to win the White House while only 36 percent favor a Republican. The leftward shift is striking even within the G.O.P. According to the Pew Research Center, young Republicans are much more moderate than older Republicans. Among millennials who lean Republican, only 31 percent have consistently conservative views. About 51 percent have a mixture of liberal and conservative views.'b'But philosophically millennials are harder to pin down. According to the Harvard Public Opinion Project, 37 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds identify as liberal and 35 percent identify as conservative.'b'If you look at how millennials actually live, you certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t see a progressive counterculture. In fact, you see what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from a generation that lived through a financial crisis, family instability and political dysfunction. You see an abstract celebration of creative transformation but a concrete hunger for order, security and stability.'b'According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 'b'millennials change jobs less'b' frequently than people in other generations. And a study of 25,000 millennials in 22 countries by Jennifer J. Deal and Alec Levenson found that at least 40 percent expect to stay with their current employer for at least nine years. Forty-four percent said they would be happy to spend the rest of their career at their current organization.'b'Millennials travel and move less than earlier generations. They are less likely to have cars, and their relative lack of driving time is not compensated for by the use of other modes of transportation.'b'Another glaring feature of millennial culture is they have been forced to be self-reliant and to take a loosely networked individualism as the normal order of the universe. Millennials have extremely 'b'low social trust'b'. According to Pew Research, just 19 percent say most people can be trusted, compared with 40 percent of boomers.'b'This leads to detachment from large entities. Just 32 percent of millennials 'b'say America is the greatest country'b' on earth, compared with 50 percent of boomers. Millennials are very suspicious of organized religion. Thirty-five percent say they are 'b'unaffiliated with any religious group'b', compared with 23 percent of Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980).'b'Just 26 percent of millennials 'b'are married'b', compared with 48 percent of boomers at that age. Only 42 percent plan to have kids. They are also having less sex. A study in the Archives of Sexual Behavior projected that millennials would have eight 'b'sexual partners by middle age'b' while boomers had 10 or 11. According to a survey from the online dating service Match, 49 percent of people in their 20s have not had sex in the past year.'b'The general impression one gets is of a generation that is stressed, energetic, creative, skeptical and in the middle of redefining, and thinning out, the nature of affiliation. Its members have been thrust into a harsher world where it is necessary to be guarded, and sensitive to risk. They want systemic change but there is no compelling form of collective action available. Their only alternative, which is their genius, is to try to fix their lives themselves, through technology and new forms of social interaction, rather than mass movements.'b'Their attitudes toward Social Security perfectly reflect this stance. Most millennials expect to see no Social Security benefits by the time they retire. But they oppose reforms to take money away from older workers to distribute it downward. They just figure they\xe2\x80\x99ll take care of retirement individually, often using 'b'algorithm-based investment vehicles'b' like Wealthfront.'b'Politically, this means that millennials may lean Democratic, but unless Barack Obama (or Bernie Sanders) is on the ticket, they don\xe2\x80\x99t strongly attach to the party and it is not clear that they will vote. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t in the 2014 midterm elections. It could be they are more interested in improving their lives by having richer experiences, and not through the sort of income transfers that come out of Washington.'b'My own guess is that millennials will be a muted political force, at least in 2016. But there will be some giant cultural explosion down the road. You just can\xe2\x80\x99t be as detached from solid supporting structures as millennials now are and lead a happy middle-aged life. Something is going to change.'b'So, will China\xe2\x80\x99s problems cause a global crisis? The good news is that the numbers, as I read them, don\xe2\x80\x99t seem big enough. The bad news is that I could be wrong, because global contagion often seems to end up being worse than hard numbers say it should. And the worse news is that if China does deliver a bad shock to the rest of the world, we are remarkably unready to deal with the consequences.'b'For those just starting to pay attention: It has been obvious for a while that China\xe2\x80\x99s economy is in big trouble. How big is hard to say, because nobody believes official Chinese statistics.'b'The basic problem is that China\xe2\x80\x99s economic model, which involves very high saving and very low consumption, was only sustainable as long as the country could grow extremely fast, justifying high investment. This in turn was possible when China had vast reserves of underemployed rural labor. But that\xe2\x80\x99s no longer true, and China now faces the tricky task of transitioning to much lower growth without stumbling into recession.'b'A reasonable strategy would have been to buy time with credit expansion and infrastructure spending while reforming the economy in ways that put more purchasing power into families\xe2\x80\x99 hands. Unfortunately, China pursued only the first half of that strategy, buying time and then squandering it. The result has been rapidly rising debt, much of it owed to poorly regulated \xe2\x80\x9cshadow banks,\xe2\x80\x9d and a threat of financial meltdown.'b'So the Chinese situation looks fairly grim \xe2\x80\x94 and new numbers have reinforced fears of a hard landing, leading not just to a 'b'plunge in Chinese stocks'b' but to sharp declines in stock prices worldwide.'b'O.K., so far so bad. And some smart people think that the global implications are really scary; George Soros is 'b'comparing it to 2008'b'.'b'As I suggested above, however, I have a hard time making the numbers for that kind of catastrophe work. Yes, China is a big economy, accounting in particular for about a 'b'quarter of world manufacturing'b', so what happens there has implications for all of us. And China buys more than $2 trillion worth of goods and services from the rest of the world each year. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a big world, with a 'b'total gross domestic product 'b' 'b'excluding China'b' of more than $60 trillion. Even a drastic fall in Chinese imports would be only a modest hit to world spending.'b'What about financial linkages? One reason America\xe2\x80\x99s subprime crisis turned global in 2008 was that foreigners in general, and European banks in particular, turned out to be badly exposed to losses on U.S. securities. But China has capital controls \xe2\x80\x94 that is, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t very open to foreign investors \xe2\x80\x94 so there\xe2\x80\x99s very little direct spillover from plunging stocks or even domestic debt defaults.'b'All of this says that while China itself is in big trouble, the consequences for the rest of us should be manageable. But I have to admit that I\xe2\x80\x99m not as relaxed about this as the above analysis says I should be. If you like, I lack the courage of my complacency. Why?'b'Part of the answer is that business cycles across nations often seem to be more synchronized than they \xe2\x80\x9cshould\xe2\x80\x9d be. For example, Europe and the United States export to each other only a small fraction of what they produce, yet they often have recessions and recoveries at the same time. Financial linkages may be part of the story, but one also suspects that there is psychological contagion: Good or bad news in one major economy affects animal spirits in others.'b'So I worry that China may export its woes in ways back-of-the-envelope calculations miss, that the Middle Kingdom\xe2\x80\x99s troubles will one way or another have the effect of depressing investment spending in America and Europe as well as in other emerging markets. And if my worries come true, we are woefully unready to deal with the shock.'b'After all, who would respond to a China shock, and how? Monetary policy would probably be of little help. With interest rates still close to zero and inflation still below target, 'b'the Fed'b' would have limited ability to fight an economic downdraft in any case, and it has probably reduced its effectiveness further by signaling its eagerness to raise rates at the first excuse. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank is already pushing to the limits of its political mandate in its own so far unsuccessful effort to raise inflation.'b'And while fiscal policy \xe2\x80\x94 essentially, spending more to offset the effects of China spending less \xe2\x80\x94 would surely work, how many people believe that Republicans would be receptive to a new Obama stimulus plan, or that German politicians would look kindly on a proposal for bigger deficits in Europe?'b'Now, my best guess is still that things won\xe2\x80\x99t be that bad \xe2\x80\x94 nasty in China, but just a bit of turbulence elsewhere. And I really, really hope that guess is right, because we don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to have a plan B anywhere in sight.'b'Donald Trump seems to view his role as the person who dredges up what nobody else wants to talk about. And so he has dragged out Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s marital infidelity.'b'The former president\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cterrible record of women abuse\xe2\x80\x9d should be considered as Hillary Clinton runs for president, said Mr. Trump. After Mrs. Clinton responded to a boorish remark by Mr. Trump by talking about his \xe2\x80\x9cpenchant for sexism,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump 'b'declared,'b' \xe2\x80\x9cIf Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women\xe2\x80\x99s card on me, she\xe2\x80\x99s wrong!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Voters will judge that one, but Mr. Trump is way out of line bringing up Mr. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s philandering. That behavior, especially his White House affair with a 22-year-old intern, is a blot on his career. It is also a tired subject that few Americans want to hear more about. If Mr. Trump has not read enough, he can curl up with a copy of the Starr report.'b'That said, it is indisputable that the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 political lives have been linked for decades, that Mr. Clinton is now playing a visible role in his wife\xe2\x80\x99s campaign and that Hillary Clinton is accountable for her own public actions.'b'For decades Mrs. Clinton has helped protect her husband\xe2\x80\x99s political career, and hers, from the taint of his sexual misbehavior, as evidenced by the Clinton team\xe2\x80\x99s attacks on the character of women linked to Mr. Clinton. When Mr. Clinton ran for president in 1992, Mrs. Clinton appeared on television beside him to assert that allegations involving Gennifer Flowers were false. In 1998, he admitted to that affair under oath. After the Monica Lewinsky affair emerged, some White House aides attempted to portray Ms. Lewinsky as the seducer.'b'Mrs. Clinton portrays her candidacy as a historic opportunity for Americans to elect a female president, and has repeatedly gone after Republican candidates, including Mr. Trump, Ben Carson and Marco Rubio, for their stances on women\xe2\x80\x99s issues. In September at the University of Northern Iowa, she pledged to 'b'combat sexual assault 'b'on college campuses, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to send a message to all of the survivors. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let anyone silence your voice. You have the right to be heard, the right to be believed, and we are with you as you go forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last month in New Hampshire, a young woman challenged Mrs. Clinton on that. Speaking at a town hall event, the woman referred to several women who have said they were sexually harassed by her husband. \xe2\x80\x9cYou recently came out to say that all rape victims should be believed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, asking if Juanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones should also be believed.'b'Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s response was odd, and unhelpful. \xe2\x80\x9cI would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Mr. Trump, of course, is not drawing distinctions between Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s attacks on her husband\xe2\x80\x99s accusers. His aim is to dredge up an ancient scandal and tar Mrs. Clinton with it in a clearly sexist fashion.

Until now, this community had little engagement with Chinese culture and language since Malaysia gained independence in 1957. Primed over the last decade by the universal appeal of Mandarin-speaking singers from Taiwan like Wang Leehom and Jay Chou, young Malaysians of all backgrounds now enthusiastically follow popular mainland Chinese talent shows like \xe2\x80\x9cAsian Wave\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI Am a Singer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Both featured Ms. Amzah: Singing principally in Mandarin, she won one and placed third in the other. As further proof of how important pop music is to the way China\xe2\x80\x99s image is changing in Malaysia, Xila \xe2\x80\x94 resplendent in her trademark hijab \xe2\x80\x94 was invited to perform for China\xe2\x80\x99s president, Xi Jinping, during his last visit to the country.'b'Keen to foster relationships with its partners in the region, China is even encouraging a two-way flow of culture. Tuning into local radio stations recently, I discovered 'b'China Radio International'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Malay-language channel, which broadcasts programs about both China and Malaysia, including a current series on Islamic culture in China. These programs were all delivered by Chinese presenters \xe2\x80\x94 in flawless Malay.'b'We have come a long way in the debate on gun safety. Well, actually we haven\xe2\x80\x99t come anywhere at all. But we\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly talked a lot.'b'And the lines have just hardened. Last week President Obama announced a teeny, weeny executive action to close a few loopholes in the background check laws. Republicans acted as if he\xe2\x80\x99d introduced an Act for the Poisoning of School Lunch.'b'Ted Cruz posted a picture of the president, wearing a military helmet and practically snarling, with the headline \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama Wants Your Guns'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Marco Rubio said it was just \xe2\x80\x9cone more way to make it harder for law-abiding people \xe2\x80\xa6 to be able to protect their families.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The current presidential campaign, as you may have noticed, is all about fear and terror. The gun lobby has been stupendously successful in arguing that the best way to protect ourselves from violence is to have the entire population packing heat.'b'If only the Parisians had been allowed to carry guns, Donald Trump says, \xe2\x80\x9cit would have been a much, much different situation.\xe2\x80\x9d The problem is not too many guns but too many gun-free zones. (Trump is going to get rid of them all on his first day, particularly the ones at the schools.)'b'The gun safety folks should just take this one head on. Controlling gun sales might be the best way of reducing gun violence, but if that\xe2\x80\x99s currently off the table, let\xe2\x80\x99s fight about whether people who want to carry weapons around should be required to know how to shoot.'b'Right now, you can acquire an entire roomful of semiautomatic rifles without providing any indication that you can avoid accidentally blasting a person three feet away pushing a baby carriage.'b'In most states, you can get a license to carry a concealed weapon without demonstrating that you know how to fire it. In the others, the bar is generally still below sea level.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t imagine anyone failing,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Zachary Stone'b', a Texas college student who passed the test in his state even though he had never handled a weapon before he walked onto the range.'b'Americans, who grew up watching action shows in which everybody is a good shot, tend to underestimate how much skill it takes to handle a gun. Hitting a moving target is hard. Shooting in a crisis is very hard. Hitting a moving target in a crisis is so hard we would need a word way better than \xe2\x80\x9cvery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPolice on average, for every 10 rounds fired, I think, actually strike something once or twice, and they are highly trained,\xe2\x80\x9d Bill Bratton, New York\xe2\x80\x99s current police commissioner, once told me.'b'There have been armed good guys present at a number of America\xe2\x80\x99s horrific mass shootings. Sometimes they fired and missed, like a security officer at Columbine High School in 1999. More often they simply froze, which was probably all to the good. During the Arizona shopping center mass shooting that wounded Representative Gabby Giffords, an armed bystander tried to help and almost accidentally shot an innocent man.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I actually pulled a gun out, I doubt we\xe2\x80\x99d be safer for it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Zach Stone.'b'Demanding that people know how to shoot before they get a gun is a triple winner.'b'The nation could find a rare moment of gun consensus by supporting safety training. Take an idea currently being proposed by an Indiana state legislator, Jim Lucas, to provide a tax credit for people who take firearms instruction. We could all get together in the middle! I am sorry to say that Mr. Lucas won\xe2\x80\x99t be personally joining us, since he is also sponsoring a bill to get rid of licensing requirements entirely. But nobody said this was going to be easy.'b'And since we\xe2\x80\x99re awash in firearms anyway, we\xe2\x80\x99d be better off if people knew how to use them without hitting anything other than their target. Even Jeb Bush, in his assault on the president\xe2\x80\x99s itsy-bitsy loophole-closing initiative, talked about how \xe2\x80\x9claw-abiding citizens that are trained to be able to protect themselves creates a safer America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bush added that this \xe2\x80\x9c'b'just reeks of common sense'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d As only he can.'b'If every gun owner had to demonstrate the ability to handle a weapon, it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily stop anyone from eventually acquiring a gun. But it would take some time and trouble, which would cut down on casual sales. Paranoid maniacs aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely to have the patience.'b'And we\xe2\x80\x99d have turned the conversation around. Ask Jeb Bush whether law-abiding citizens who aren\xe2\x80\x99t trained to protect themselves create a safer America. Ask Donald Trump whether the Parisians ought to learn how to shoot before they begin returning fire in crowded concert halls. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start the rumor that Ted Cruz hates gun safety.'b'Innocent bystanders unite. God knows we\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing to lose.'b'AS former state public health officials in Maryland, we were quite embarrassed and angry to learn that we had been driving around in little pollution factories, otherwise known as Volkswagen diesels. At the same time, we understand that the car owners are not the only victims of the company\xe2\x80\x99s deceptions. To make right by the environment and those harmed by air pollution, Volkswagen should stop sending us apologies \xe2\x80\x94 and should start replacing thousands of old school buses across the country.'b'As with the polluting cars, old school buses run on diesel fuel and emit a toxic mix of gases, including the nitrogen oxides 'b'associated'b' with asthma, exacerbations of lung disease, and premature death. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the idea of replacing old school buses comes in. Volkswagen faces potentially $20 billion in fines under the Clean Air Act in a lawsuit filed by the Environmental Protection Agency (not to mention potential liability in lawsuits brought by various states). Directing a portion of these resources into cleaning up the machines that take our children to and from school every day would help make matters right.'b'In addition to polluting the air, the diesel exhaust seeps into the bus cabin, directly sickening children. A California 'b'study 'b'published in 2001 found that the level of diesel exhaust in old school buses was up to four times greater than in cars, and up to eight times greater than the statewide average air level. According to the 'b'E.P.A.'b', \xe2\x80\x9colder, more polluting school buses can lead to significant health risks for students who typically ride these buses for one-half to two hours a day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Replace these buses, and children\xe2\x80\x99s health improves. In a study published last June, researchers at the Universities of Michigan and Wisconsin reported 'b'finding 'b'that having cleaner air on school buses led to improved lung capacity and substantial reductions in absenteeism, particularly among children with asthma.'b'By replacing old school buses, in addition to fixing the affected cars, Volkswagen can make up for the damage it did to the environment and improve the lives of many thousands of children in the process. Eventually, the company would be able to say that its net impact on air pollution in the United States, at least as measured by nitrogen oxides, was actually negative.'b'With help from Kirsten Koehler, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, we did the math. In September, the E.P.A. directed Volkswagen to recall 'b'around 480,000'b' polluting diesel cars, each of which produces roughly between 'b'10 and 40 times'b' more nitrogen oxides than allowed. The cumulative impact of the Volkswagen deception has been estimated at 'b'about 46,000'b' tons since 2008.'b'We estimate there are about 250,000 school buses still on the road that were manufactured before stringent emissions regulations took effect in 2007. Using the E.P.A.\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'diesel emissions quantifier'b', we calculated that replacing one in 10 of these buses, a total of 25,000, would save about 5,000 excess tons of pollution in the first year, and the benefits would continue as long as the buses were on the road. In fact, replacing 25,000 old school buses would eventually make up for the cumulative total of 46,000 excess tons of nitrogen oxides from the polluting Volkswagens.'b'With a new school bus costing about $80,000, this bus-replacement effort would run Volkswagen about $2 billion, around 10 percent of its potential federal liability. We would welcome the company\xe2\x80\x99s replacing even more old buses.'b'With authorization from Congress, the company could simply write a check to the E.P.A., which already runs a program under the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act that helps local governments retrofit or upgrade their fleets. This program is in desperate need of greater investment. The E.P.A. recently 'b'announced 'b'just over $7 million in grants to fix or replace buses in 85 localities, a small fraction of the applications. The program has the capacity to give out much more to support school districts across the country.'b'Because of the diffuse nature of environmental pollution, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to point to a specific individual and conclude that a Volkswagen car caused his or her asthma attack. But it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be hard to find thousands of schoolchildren who would benefit from new school buses. As the air pollution expert Dr. Robert J. Laumbach of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey recently 'b'wrote'b', \xe2\x80\x9cEfforts to clean up diesel engine emissions from school buses are likely to have tremendous societal benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Linking the Volkswagen scandal to the replacement of old school buses would also make the larger point that there are opportunities all around us to clean up our air and protect our health.'b'As owners of diesel-powered VW\xe2\x80\x99s, we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking for big payouts. But we do care about justice. Volkswagen\xe2\x80\x99s global chief is expected to meet with top E.P.A. officials next week to discuss the recall of the diesel vehicles built with software to evade emissions tests. Perhaps the agency can add our proposal to the topics up for discussion.'b'If Volkswagen doesn\xe2\x80\x99t step up voluntarily and accept the corporate responsibility that fits the evidence, forcing the company to pay to replace a large number of old school buses strikes us as a punishment that fits the crime.'b'Just when 'b'President Obama'b' was attempting a reasoned debate on gun control this week, Donald Trump was engaged in his latest pandering to the gun rights crowd \xe2\x80\x94 vowing as president to strike down laws that bar firearms from schools. \xe2\x80\x9dMy first day, it gets signed, O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump told a campaign rally in Vermont on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cMy first day. There\xe2\x80\x99s no more gun-free zones.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s standards for uninformed bombast, the vow was remarkable for its ignorance of the fact that gun-free zones have been thoughtfully approved by numerous local governments concerned about the 'b'gun violence afflicting the nation'b'; remarkable also for the imperiousness with which he would wipe away with the stroke of a pen safety measures enacted after 20 schoolchildren and six educators were murdered three years ago in the 'b'Sandy Hook assault-rifle'b' massacre.'b'It was remarkable, too, for its contrast with Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s televised defense of his own 'b'modest gun proposals'b', for which he asked full and fair attention by this year\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidates so that all of them might rationally address genuine public concerns with the 'b'grim reality'b' of 30,000 gun deaths every year.'b'Mr. Trump quickly dashed that hope, though his response has been no worse than those of the 'b'other Republican candidates'b', who across the board have peddled simplistic evasions and dangerous misinformation. \xe2\x80\x9cObama Wants Your Guns,\xe2\x80\x9d warns a deceitful fund-raising pitch on 'b'Senator Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s website'b', which also features a photograph of Mr. Obama distorted to show him in military attack helmet and combat uniform ready to confiscate the hundreds of millions of guns now in public hands. These are among other hallucinatory fictions peddled by opportunists like Mr. Cruz as they 'b'comfort an arms industry'b' enriched by a gun mortality rate far higher than that of any other modern nation.'b'Sadly, the boom times for gun makers become clearer with each new burst of gun carnage and each unheeded safety plea from the president.'b'Last year, as the continuing 'b'mass shootings'b' shocked the nation to near hopelessness, 'b'background checks'b' of eager gun buyers reached the highest on record, at 23 million, up from nine million in 1999. In tandem, the stock prices of major gun manufacturers continued to skyrocket, growing more than 'b'900 percent'b' since Mr. Obama took office. A near giddy investment manager hailed the president as \xe2\x80\x9cthe best gun salesman on the planet,\xe2\x80\x9d as if the Republicans, with their 'b'irrational campaign warnings'b', were not the industry\xe2\x80\x99s supersalesmen.'b'The one bit of hope is that the 'b'Democratic presidential candidates'b' have not been afraid to campaign on the issue without demagogy and to propose safer laws. For all the exaggerated political clout associated with the industry\xe2\x80\x99s gun lobby, at least one party may be ready to call the Oz-like bluff of the 'b'National Rifle Association'b'. At some point voters should force whoever the Republican nominee turns out to be to come out from behind the curtain of gun rights bluster and face the debate about the nation\xe2\x80\x99s relentless gun violence.'b'It was inevitable that China\xe2\x80\x99s economy would slow from its once turbocharged growth rates. But its leaders have made so many mistakes in recent months that they have turned what should have been a benign, natural slowdown into a chaotic descent.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s main stock index fell nearly 10 percent for the week, depressing stock and commodity prices elsewhere. These drops are not in themselves a big economic problem. The larger question is whether China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, their credibility already damaged, will see this moment for what it is: a dramatic warning that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to make fundamental changes in the way they manage the economy.'b'The Chinese economy, the world\xe2\x80\x99s second largest, is growing at nearly 7 percent a year \xe2\x80\x94 down from 10.6 percent in 2010 but still a healthy pace for a country at its stage of development. The problem is that the boom was fueled by lavish investment and spending as well as profligate borrowing, a lot of which will probably not be paid back. China\xe2\x80\x99s central government orchestrated that binge by pumping billions of dollars into the economy in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis and by failing to enact needed reforms that would make it easier for private and foreign companies to compete with inefficient state-owned enterprises.'b'Beginning last year, Chinese officials also used state-owned media to 'b'encourage individual investors'b' to pour their savings and borrowed money into the stock market, leading to a massive bubble. When the market started to tumble over the summer, the government 'b'blamed rumormongers'b' and speculators, and ordered securities firms and state-owned companies to keep buying, which simply disguised the underlying problems.'b'The lesson here is clear: Instead of trying to micromanage stock prices, Chinese officials ought to be strengthening the economy, foremost by shifting its emphasis from investment to consumer spending and services. This is important because China can no longer grow by taking people off the farm and putting them to work in factories. It needs to move people into white-collar jobs. To take one example, officials could help create more such jobs and make the economy more competitive by easing the way for private companies to get into industries like telecommunications and insurance that are currently dominated by a handful of state-owned corporations.'b'China also has to clean up its financial system. Many businesses and local governments have borrowed billions of dollars to build high-speed rail lines, real estate developments and other projects, many of which are not going to produce the returns needed to pay off those debts. The government should encourage lenders and borrowers to quickly restructure loans that paid for those projects so that banks are not crippled by bad debts and can continue making new loans. Officials also need to shut down highly inefficient state-owned businesses.'b'How China deals with its problems will have far-reaching implications because the country has become such a big part of the world economy. It is one of the biggest consumers of commodities like oil, soybeans and iron ore, and when demand falters, economies in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Africa suffer. The 'b'price of crude oil'b' fell to about $33 a barrel this week, down from about $50 a year earlier.'b'Even industrialized countries like Germany, Japan and the United States are vulnerable, though less so than commodity exporters, because they sell manufactured goods to China and many multinational companies have invested a lot of money in the country. Some analysts are concerned that Beijing will simply fall back on a familiar tool to aid the domestic economy: devaluing the currency, the renminbi. That would raise China\xe2\x80\x99s exports and reduce its imports, but it would do so at the expense of the rest of the global economy, which is itself not very healthy.'b'Since early August, the renminbi has already fallen about 5 percent against the dollar. It has also been under pressure because as the Chinese economy weakens many people and companies in China are clamoring to convert their savings into dollars to buy property and invest in businesses overseas.'b'Ultimately, however, China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders must realize that they need to modernize their policies by encouraging more private initiatives and greater competition. Their nation has changed dramatically over the last three decades, and a command-and-control approach to economic management will not produce the results of the past.'b'You could have gotten dizzy following the bouncing governor, Andrew Cuomo, around New York in the last few days, ahead of his State of the State address next week. To generate excitement about his plans for transportation and infrastructure, he has been leading a road show, spreading proposals one by one, far and wide. Between Proposal 5 (lower Thruway tolls!) and 7 (a bigger Javits Convention Center!), was one to make a New Yorker perk up: 'b'Proposal 6'b', transforming Penn Station.'b'Whoa, say the commuters who have lived with, and hated, Penn Station since the old one was razed in 1963. Generations of them have worn ruts in the floor and holes in their souls trudging the low corridors of the Long Island Rail Road concourse, whose ceilings 'b'gush'b' when it rains. Picture a minimum-security prison that sells magazines and popcorn, or a rat colony under martial law, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a pretty good idea of what needs fixing.'b'The germ of Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s plan was championed long ago by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who died in 2003. It involves moving one tenant, Amtrak, to the grand Farley Post Office across Eighth Avenue and then renovating the Penn dungeon for the L.I.R.R., New Jersey Transit and the subways. Though developers were chosen and plans drawn up, and the first phase of work \xe2\x80\x94 on ventilation, stairs and corridors \xe2\x80\x94 is underway, the overall project has been 'b'stalled'b'.'b'Now Mr. Cuomo wants to revive it, though in what form is still not certain. There are several possibilities. Nobody, sadly, is talking about moving Madison Square Garden, which sits upon Penn Station like a manhole cover, blocking light and air. The grandest idea the governor outlined includes a new sunlight-drenched station entrance on Eighth Avenue, but that requires getting rid of a 5,600-seat theater under the Garden. Other options include a more modest entrance on 33rd Street, or simply tidying up the inside without any \xe2\x80\x9cmajor external changes\xe2\x80\x9d at all.'b'Beyond aesthetic improvements, the real need is to increase capacity at Penn Station, which was not built to handle 650,000 passengers a day. The test will be to see what flesh is put on these and other proposals that have been flying from the governor\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and press office. Mr. Cuomo, who seems to have gone from zero to Robert Moses in 60 seconds, is also talking about building 'b'a third L.I.R.R. track'b' on part of the Main Line in Nassau County and digging a tunnel to connect Long Island to points north. He will get no complaint from New Yorkers who like it when governors tackle big infrastructure. Now he needs to fully explain with what money, and \xe2\x80\x94 the forever question \xe2\x80\x94 when?'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Our Shared Responsibility'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Barack Obama (Op-Ed, Jan. 8):'b'I grew up shooting firearms with my father, going hunting and learning about basic firearms safety.

CRANK'b'Lawrence, Kan.'b'THE crisis of painkiller addiction is becoming increasingly personal: Sixteen percent of Americans know someone who has died from a prescription painkiller overdose, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation survey; 9 percent have seen a family member or close friend die.'b'Addictive opioid painkillers were once reserved for extreme situations like terminal cancer. But opioids like Vicodin and OxyContin are now widely prescribed for common conditions like arthritis and lower back pain. The consequences have been catastrophic: In 2013, prescription painkillers caused nearly 7,000 emergency room visits and 44 deaths every day.'b'How do we tackle this crisis? We often hear about efforts to clamp down on abuse, for example by regulating pain clinics and monitoring prescription patterns. But these won\xe2\x80\x99t dent the demand for opioids unless we can find better ways to treat the hundred million Americans said to suffer from chronic pain. Simply switching to other drugs isn\xe2\x80\x99t the answer. Few new painkillers are being approved, and existing ones, like Motrin and Tylenol, come with their own risks when used long-term, and some appear to be less effective than we once thought.'b'Help might instead come from an unexpected corner: the placebo effect.'b'This phenomenon \xe2\x80\x94 in which someone feels better after receiving fake treatment \xe2\x80\x94 was once dismissed as an illusion. People who are ill often improve regardless of the treatment they receive. But neuroscientists are discovering that in some conditions, including pain, placebos create biological effects similar to those caused by drugs.'b'Taking a placebo painkiller dampens activity in pain-related areas of the brain and spinal cord, and triggers the release of endorphins, the natural pain-relieving chemicals that opioid drugs are designed to mimic. Even when we take a real painkiller, a big chunk of its effect is delivered not by any direct chemical action, but by our expectation that the drug will work. Studies show that widely used painkillers like morphine, buprenorphine and tramadol are markedly less effective if we don\xe2\x80\x99t know we\xe2\x80\x99re taking them.'b'Placebo effects in pain are so large, in fact, that drug manufacturers are finding it hard to beat them. Finding ways to minimize placebo effects in trials, for example by screening out those who are most susceptible, is now a big focus for research. But what if instead we seek to harness these effects? Placebos might ruin drug trials, but they also show us a new approach to treating pain.'b'It is unethical to deceive patients by prescribing fake treatments, of course. But there is evidence that people with some conditions benefit even if they 'b'know 'b'they are taking placebos. In a 2014 study that followed 459 migraine attacks in 66 patients, honestly labeled placebos provided significantly more pain relief than no treatment, and were nearly half as effective as the painkiller Maxalt. (The study also found that a placebo labeled \xe2\x80\x9cplacebo\xe2\x80\x9d was 60 percent as effective as Maxalt if it was labeled \xe2\x80\x9cplacebo.\xe2\x80\x9d If the placebo was labeled \xe2\x80\x9cMaxalt,\xe2\x80\x9d it was again 60 percent as effective as the real drug under its real label.)'b'With placebo responses in pain so high \xe2\x80\x94 and the risks of drugs so severe \xe2\x80\x94 why not prescribe a course of \xe2\x80\x9chonest\xe2\x80\x9d placebos for those who wish to try it, before proceeding, if necessary, to an active drug?'b'Another option is to employ alternative therapies, which through placebo responses can benefit patients even when there is no physical mode of action. A series of large trials in Germany published between 2005 and 2009 compared real and sham acupuncture (in which needles are placed at nonacupuncture points) with either no treatment or routine clinical care, for chronic pain conditions including migraine, tension headaches, lower back pain and osteoarthritis. Patients who received the acupuncture, real or sham, reported a similar amount of pain relief \xe2\x80\x94 and more than those who received no treatment or routine care that included pain medication.'b'Rather than relying on dummy pills and treatments, however, a broader hope is that teasing out why and when placebos work \xe2\x80\x94 and for whom \xe2\x80\x94 will help to maximize the effectiveness of drugs, and in some cases allow us to do without them.'b'The available funding for such research is minuscule compared with the efforts poured into developing new drugs. But a key ingredient is expectation: The greater our belief that a treatment will work, the better we\xe2\x80\x99ll respond.'b'Individual attitudes and experiences are important, as are cultural factors. Placebo effects are getting stronger in the United States, for example, though not elsewhere. Researchers reported last year that in trials published in 1996, drugs for chronic pain produced on average 27 percent more pain relief than placebos. By 2013, that advantage had slipped to just 9 percent. Likely explanations include a growing cultural belief in the effectiveness of painkillers \xe2\x80\x94 a result of direct-to-consumer advertising (illegal in most other countries) and perhaps the fact that so many Americans have taken these drugs in the past.'b'These findings have implications for deciding which patients are likely to benefit from drugs \xe2\x80\x94 someone who has strong faith in painkillers\xe2\x80\x99 effectiveness is more likely to benefit than someone who is suspicious of conventional medicine \xe2\x80\x94 as well as how physicians explain the benefits and side effects of treatments they prescribe. Trials show, for example, that strengthening patients\xe2\x80\x99 positive expectations and reducing their anxiety during a variety of procedures, including minimally invasive surgery, while still being honest, can reduce the dose of painkillers required and cut complications.'b'Placebo studies also reveal the value of social interaction as a treatment for pain. Harvard researchers studied patients in pain from irritable bowel syndrome and found that 44 percent of those given sham acupuncture had adequate relief from their symptoms. If the person who performed the acupuncture was extra supportive and empathetic, however, that figure jumped to 62 percent.'b'Placebos tell us that pain is a complex mix of biological, psychological and social factors. We need to develop better drugs to treat it, but let\xe2\x80\x99s also take more seriously the idea of relieving pain without them. With dozens of Americans dying every day from prescription painkillers, we need all the help we can get.'b'Readers respond to an essay about \xe2\x80\x9cgratitude\xe2\x80\x99s rise to self-help celebrity status.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the Editor: Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Selfish Side of Gratitude,'b'\xe2\x80\x9d by Barbara Ehrenreich (Sunday Review, Jan. 3): What a beautifully cogent way to frame the onset of another year. Not only is this contemporary wave of self-improvement grating in its overuse of #gratitude and #authenticity, but as expressed so wonderfully in this essay, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a ruse to justify embracing your inner narcissist at the expense of your broader community.'b'Actual gratitude used to be accompanied by the desire to give back and share the wealth, so to speak. Today\xe2\x80\x99s all-too-common false gratitude seems to confuse sharing the wealth with allowing others to bask in the reflected glory of your own good feelings about you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not enlightened, just selfish and dreadful. We live in a time of such horrible inequity and struggle, with, yes, much to be grateful for, but also much to rectify and improve. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t find meaning in connecting with the lives of others unless we can make it all about ourselves, we\xe2\x80\x99re truly lost.'b'KIRSTEN UCHITEL'b'Carlsbad, Calif.'b'To the Editor: I believe that Barbara Ehrenreich mischaracterizes the \xe2\x80\x9cscience of gratitude\xe2\x80\x9d and the public radio special our center recently co-produced, suggesting that both exemplify a selfish form of gratitude that lacks a social conscience. In fact, the radio special locates the essence of gratitude in recognizing our connection to, and even dependence on, other people, and it highlights the ways that gratitude can foster generosity and a commitment to the greater good.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s more, Ms. Ehrenreich disparages research-based exercises like keeping a gratitude journal because they involve \xe2\x80\x9cno communication or interaction of any kind.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet studies clearly suggest that the relationship-strengthening powers of gratitude can be achieved through a variety of practices; some may involve direct expressions of gratitude to others, some may not.'b'As an antidote to the \xe2\x80\x9cselfish side\xe2\x80\x9d of gratitude, Ms. Ehrenreich urges us to direct our thanks to the unseen and underpaid people who pick, process and deliver our food, advocating \xe2\x80\x9csolidarity\xe2\x80\x9d with these workers. Yet research suggests that indebtedness doesn\xe2\x80\x99t actually motivate the kinds of pro-social actions that she (and we) would like to see more of. Feelings of gratitude, however, are actually a route to a broader social awareness. Gratitude counters feelings of entitlement and challenges our tendency to take the good things in our lives for granted. From that basic realization can come a host of social goods like generosity, humility, a sense of connectedness and even solidarity.'b'JASON MARSH'b'Berkeley, Calif.'b''b'The writer is editor in chief and director of programs at the Greater Good Science Center, University of California, Berkeley.'b''b'To the Editor: I was so disheartened by Barbara Ehrenreich\xe2\x80\x99s leap to assume that it\xe2\x80\x99s selfish to find personal empowerment through positive thinking and gratitude. It\xe2\x80\x99s ironic for me personally that she points to the crash of 2008 as an excellent reason for people to have abandoned \xe2\x80\x9csilly\xe2\x80\x9d positive thinking.'b'When my husband and I almost lost our house that year, struggling with health insurance premiums and a new baby, I discovered the exact self-help messages that she\xe2\x80\x99s dismissing, and they kept me afloat mentally so that I could focus on a plan to get work, and get us out of our hole. I was in despair, and found that making lists of things I 'b'could 'b'be thankful for brought me some happiness, then more happiness \xe2\x80\x94 and, yes, it 'b'did 'b'feel good, thank you very much!'b'And I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t selfish. I dug myself out of an onslaught of depression, and when we got back on track financially, I did practice a \xe2\x80\x9cvigorous and inclusive\xe2\x80\x9d gratitude by giving back to people who needed it. There\xe2\x80\x99s another self-help clich\xc3\xa9 about putting your own oxygen mask on first, then helping others, and you simply can\xe2\x80\x99t do that without first practicing personal (selfish?) gratitude.'b'PAULA TIBERIUS'b'North Hollywood, Calif.'b'To the Editor: Barbara Ehrenreich kindly mentioned my book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Gratitude Diaries.\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99s correct that gratitude is prosocial and outward looking, and in my year of living gratefully, I gained a new view of giving and generosity. Gratitude can\xe2\x80\x99t be \xe2\x80\x9cselfish\xe2\x80\x9d when it helps connect us to other people and appreciate what is around us. When you are grateful for what you have, you want to do more and give more. Many studies have shown that grateful people are more generous. Ms. Ehrenreich should be encouraged that saying \xe2\x80\x9cthank you\xe2\x80\x9d and recognizing the contributions of people at every level are a positive start to ending inequalities and inspiring an inclusive view.'b'JANICE KAPLAN'b'New York'b'To the Editor: Barbara Ehrenreich suggests that a Walmart employee whose base pay was raised from $8 to $9 an hour would be a \xe2\x80\x9cchump\xe2\x80\x9d to feel grateful in light of the fortune of Walmart owners and executives. She believes that the huge gap between the working poor and the people they work for is unjust in the extreme. I agree that it is unjust, and like Ms. Ehrenreich I want social change. The question I have is whether an attitude of gratitude for small gains gets in the way of the big gains needed to bring about social change. Does it dissipate the anger that might motivate the drive for a more just society?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure it does. Anger can blind as well as motivate. Anger can lead to great frustration, and giving up. Gratitude, on the other hand, while reducing stress and fostering happiness, also can reduce the tendency of people to engage in self-blame or disengage. It seems to be more likely to lead to greater efforts to bring about needed social change.'b'To me, the best response to a $1 raise in a Walmart worker\xe2\x80\x99s wage is to be grateful, to see that change is possible, but to be clearheaded about the need for a lot more change. It has always seemed to me that the happy warrior type of social reformers \xe2\x80\x94 like F.D.R. or Gandhi or the antislavery activist William Wilberforce, who showed gratitude for small gains but never lost sight of the need for more \xe2\x80\x94 have brought about the more lasting social change.'b'NEALE ADAMS'b'Vancouver, British Columbia'b'To the Editor: The opposite of gratitude, I think, is not resentment but entitlement. Some people think: It is right and proper that I have an income of $400,000 a year, eat at fine restaurants, live in a large house. I deserve these things. I will do whatever I must to protect these rights \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, by fighting against higher taxes.'b'Speaking for myself only: I have a warm, dry bed to sleep in every night; plentiful, tasty food; clean water at a touch; my local public library. I am glad to have these things. I try not to take them for granted. I am grateful \xe2\x80\x94 to whom? To the gods? No, to the many people who make my style of life possible. I consider it my duty \xe2\x80\x94 which I fail at, unfortunately \xe2\x80\x94 to take action to spread these good things to everyone. If that means political struggle against the entitled, then so be it.'b'JOHN PLOTZ'b'Hayward, Calif.'b'A QUARTER-CENTURY ago, Newark and nearby Union City epitomized the failure of American urban school systems. Students, mostly poor minority and immigrant children, were performing abysmally. Graduation rates were low. Plagued by corruption and cronyism, both districts had a revolving door of superintendents. New Jersey officials threatened to take over Union City\xe2\x80\x99s schools in 1989 but gave them a one-year reprieve instead. Six years later, state education officials, decrying the gross mismanagement of the Newark schools, seized control there.'b'In 2009, the political odd couple of Chris Christie, the Republican governor-elect, and Cory Booker, Newark\xe2\x80\x99s charismatic mayor, joined forces, convinced that the Newark system could be reinvented in just five years, in part by closing underperforming schools, encouraging charter schools and weakening teacher tenure. In 2010 they persuaded Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, to invest $100 million in their grand experiment. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can flip a whole city!\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor enthused, \xe2\x80\x9cand create a national model.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No one expected a national model out of Union City. Without the resources given to Newark, the school district there, led by a middle-level bureaucrat named Fred Carrigg, was confronted with two huge challenges: How could English learners, three-quarters of the students, become fluent in English? And how could youngsters, many of whom came from homes where books were rarities, be turned into adept readers?'b'Today Union City, which opted for homegrown gradualism, is regarded as a poster child for good urban education. Newark, despite huge infusions of money and outside talent, has struggled by comparison. In 2014, Union City\xe2\x80\x99s graduation rate was 81 percent, exceeding the national average; Newark\xe2\x80\x99s was 69 percent.'b'What explains this difference? The experience of Union City, as well as other districts, like Montgomery County, Md., and Long Beach, Calif., that have beaten the demographic odds, show that there\xe2\x80\x99s no miracle cure for what ails public education. What business gurus label \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous improvement,\xe2\x80\x9d and the rest of us call slow-and-steady, wins the race.'b'Slow-and-steady was anathema to Mr. Booker and Mr. Christie, who had big dreams for Newark. But as Dale Russakoff writes in her absorbing account \xe2\x80\x9cThe Prize,\xe2\x80\x9d the politicians\xe2\x80\x99 optimism proved misplaced. What went wrong had as much to do with their top-down approach as with the proposals themselves.'b'The mayor pledged to involve the public before making any decisions, but efforts at community engagement, orchestrated by out-of-town advisers, proved shambolic. The only recommendations that got traction \xe2\x80\x94 closing 11 public schools, opening charters and themed high schools \xe2\x80\x94 were advanced by consultants, who gobbled up more than $20 million in fees.'b'In 2011, Mr. Christie appointed 39-year-old Cami Anderson \xe2\x80\x94 a Teach for America alumna \xe2\x80\x94 superintendent. She introduced some solid ideas, like replacing the weakest performers with \xe2\x80\x9crenew schools\xe2\x80\x9d and persuading charters to enroll more poor kids. But she ran into trouble with parents when she did away with neighborhood schools and laid off hundreds of workers to pay for her initiatives.'b'Her hurry-up style made matters worse. \xe2\x80\x9cShe didn\xe2\x80\x99t listen,\xe2\x80\x9d contends Ms. Russakoff. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said her plan \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9816-dimensional chess\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 was too complex for parents.\xe2\x80\x9d After repeated heckling by teachers and parents, Ms. Anderson stopped attending board meetings.'b'One of Mr. Booker\xe2\x80\x99s goals was to make Newark the nation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccharter school capital,\xe2\x80\x9d and he largely succeeded. While these schools have recorded higher test scores and graduation rates than the traditional schools, money explains much of that gap. Freed from the district\xe2\x80\x99s bureaucracy, the charters have nearly a third more dollars to spend on each student, $12,650 versus $9,604, which buys additional teachers, tutors and social workers.'b'The push to expand charters angers activists like Junius Williams, director of the Abbott Leadership Institute at Rutgers University. \xe2\x80\x9cCharters have drained resources necessary to teach most Newark students,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me.'b'In 1989, with one year to shape up Union City, Mr. Carrigg, with a cadre of teachers and administrators, devised a multipronged strategy: Focus on how kids learn best, how teachers teach most effectively and how parents can be engaged. Non-English speakers had previously been expected to acquire the language through the sink-or-swim method. So the district junked its old approach. Instead, English learners are initially taught in their own language, mainly Spanish, and then are gradually shifted to English. The system started hiring more teachers who spoke Spanish or had E.S.L. (English as a Second Language) training.'b'The bilingual approach went beyond the classroom. Even though many parents speak only Spanish, meetings had been conducted and written information prepared only in English. In the new era, bilingualism quickly became the norm. Parents, made to feel welcome in the schools, were conscripted to help with their children\xe2\x80\x99s homework and reinforce the schools\xe2\x80\x99 high expectations for them.'b'To get students excited about reading, the schools became word-soaked environments, with tons of reading and daily writing assignments linked even to subjects like art and science that traditionally don\xe2\x80\x99t require as much writing.'b'The Union City reformers opted to focus initially on the youngest children, whose potential for improvement was greatest. When New Jersey began to fund preschool for poor urban districts in the late 1990s, the district seized on the opportunity to devise a state-of-the-art program that enrolled almost every 3- and 4-year-old in the community.'b'Teachers rethought skill-and-drill instruction, instead emphasizing hands-on learning and group projects. Help came, in the form of coaches \xe2\x80\x94 veteran teachers \xe2\x80\x94 working side by side with newbies and time set aside for teachers to collaborate. Students were frequently assessed, not to punish teachers but to pinpoint areas where help was needed.'b'Stable leadership proved essential. In the years preceding the state\xe2\x80\x99s near-takeover, superintendents were hired and fired based on their politics; during the past quarter-century there have been just three superintendents, all of them products of the district. Nationwide, the average tenure of a city schools chief is only three years.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe real story of Union City is that it 'b'didn\xe2\x80\x99t'b' fall back,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Carrigg told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt stabilized and has continued to improve.\xe2\x80\x9d Recent changes include the introduction of Mandarin Chinese from preschool on, a STEM-focused elementary school and a nursery for young parents in high school.'b'Newark\xe2\x80\x99s big mistake was not so much that the school officials embraced one solution or another but that they placed their faith in the idea of disruptive change and charismatic leaders. Union City adopted the opposite approach, embracing the idea of gradual change and working within existing structures.'b'Newark is beginning to do the same. Since the appointment in 2015 of Christopher Cerf, formerly New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s education commissioner, as Newark\xe2\x80\x99s superintendent, more attention is being paid to the positive side of the school district ledger. While charters remain controversial in Newark, Mr. Cerf emphasizes helping the public schools achieve similar results. \xe2\x80\x9cCharters are succeeding,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they have substantially more discretion. We need to level the playing field.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Cerf and Raz Baraka, who succeeded Cory Booker as mayor, recently announced that up to $12.5 million of the Zuckerberg gift will be invested in a network of \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity schools\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 sunrise-to-sunset schools that offer health care and social services, located in the city\xe2\x80\x99s most troubled neighborhoods.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMark Zuckerberg\xe2\x80\x99s $100 million gift isn\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of money in a district that spends $1 billion a year, but it sparked the conversation,\xe2\x80\x9d Dominique Lee, the executive director of Brick, which runs two Newark schools, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople are angry now at what\xe2\x80\x99s been going on, but it\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98good angry,\xe2\x80\x99 not \xe2\x80\x98bad angry,\xe2\x80\x99 like before. They\xe2\x80\x99re asking: \xe2\x80\x98What do we need to do to save traditional public schools?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Aside from the barbarism and injustice of 'b'Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s execution'b' of 47 men on Jan. 2, the state-sponsored killings \xe2\x80\x94 some by beheading \xe2\x80\x94 bucked a strong trend against capital punishment in most of the world. According to the annual report of 'b'Amnesty International'b', executions were carried out in 22 countries in 2014, the year covered; there were 25 in 2004. The total number of people known to have been executed also fell. To its disgrace, the United States was still among the five countries that most often used capital punishment \xe2\x80\x94 alongside China, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Iraq \xe2\x80\x94 but the number of executions in America continued to decline.'b'Amnesty\xe2\x80\x99s report said an \xe2\x80\x9calarming number\xe2\x80\x9d of countries that carried out the death penalty in 2014 were responding to perceived threats to state security, the major factor in most of the Saudi executions. Pakistan resumed the execution of civilians after an attack by the Taliban on a Peshawar school, and China \xe2\x80\x94 which is thought to have the most executions of any country but keeps the number secret \xe2\x80\x94 used the death penalty in response to ethnic violence in the Xinjiang region. In Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and in Shiite-ruled Iran, death sentences often derive from a stern interpretation of Islamic law.'b'But there is no compelling evidence that the death penalty deters crime, whether murder or terrorism. And absent deterrence, what remains is just vengeance.'b'In the United States, that is rendered all the more absurd by efforts to make death seem humane through lethal injections. There is considerable evidence in America, moreover, that racism, unscrupulous prosecutors and shoddy public defenders account for a large number of dubious or blatantly unjust impositions of capital punishment. More than 150 wrongfully convicted people have been freed since 1973. As the case against capital punishment builds, the numbers of executions and death sentences have steadily declined, reaching their lowest level in at least two decades in 2015, according to the 'b'Death Penalty Information Center'b', with 93 percent of the executions carried out in only four states \xe2\x80\x94 Texas, Missouri, Georgia and Florida.'b'What that suggests, as does the Amnesty report, is that in the end, it may not be the debates about whether capital punishment is legal, effective, just, moral or, in the case of the United States, constitutional, that determine how long it persists. It is the fact that the people of the world, including Americans, are increasingly coming to recognize the death penalty for what it is: morally unacceptable, inhuman, barbaric, unjust and useless.'b'A case the Supreme Court 'b'will hear on Monday morning'b' threatens to undermine a four-decade-old ruling that upheld a key source of funding for public-sector unions, the last major bastion of unionized workers in America.'b'In the 1977 decision 'b'Abood v. Detroit Board of Education'b', the justices ruled that public unions may charge all employees \xe2\x80\x94 members and nonmembers alike \xe2\x80\x94 for the costs of collective bargaining related to their employment. For nonmembers, these are known as \xe2\x80\x9cfair-share fees.\xe2\x80\x9d But nonmembers may not be compelled to pay for the union\xe2\x80\x99s political or ideological activities.'b'The Abood ruling was a sensible compromise between the state\xe2\x80\x99s interest in labor peace and productivity and the individual worker\xe2\x80\x99s interest in his or her freedom of speech and association. Before the decision, strikes and labor unrest in the public sector were far more common, as workers struggled to have their voices heard in the absence of meaningful organized representation.'b'Stronger unions have not only helped ensure that essential public services are more efficient and effective; they have also led to higher wages and better benefits for workers. According to a 'b'report'b' by the Economic Policy Institute, public employees in states with fair-share fees enjoy nearly the same compensation as their private-sector counterparts, while those in states that have banned such fees get 9 percent less.'b'But leaders of the \xe2\x80\x9cright to work\xe2\x80\x9d movement \xe2\x80\x94 which is funded largely by corporate interests and has helped 'b'25 states'b' ban fair-share fees \xe2\x80\x94 have been gunning from the start to overturn the Abood decision. Today they have a good friend on the court in Justice Samuel Alito Jr., who has written two majority opinions since 2012 calling the ruling into serious doubt.'b'The 'b'latest challenge'b' targets the California public-school teachers\xe2\x80\x99 union, which gets fair-share fees from about 29,000 employees, or a little under 10 percent of the work force. After Justice Alito 'b'suggested in 2012'b' that he would be open to striking down all fair-share fees, the anti-union activists rushed their case through the lower courts.'b''b'The plaintiffs say'b' being required to pay anything at all to the union violates their First Amendment rights. And when the government is the employer, they argue, all union activities are inherently political.'b'The court rejected these arguments in Abood, in part because the government has more leeway when it acts as an employer, and in part because unions are required by law to represent all employees. As Justice Antonin Scalia 'b'explained in a 1991 case'b', \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the state creates in the nonmembers a legal entitlement from the union, it may compel them to pay the cost.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In other words, mandatory fees eliminate the problem of free riders \xe2\x80\x94 employees who enjoy raises and other benefits negotiated by the union without paying for them. In a 2014 ruling, Justice Alito 'b'dismissed the free-rider concern'b' and claimed that those who support a union will willingly pay its dues, but this is contradicted by both common sense and 'b'experience'b'.'b'States should continue to be free to fashion their own arrangements for handling labor relations. More than 20 have fair-share fee systems which encompass thousands of negotiated contracts representing millions of teachers, police officers, firefighters and other public workers. All this could be upset by a ruling for the plaintiffs.'b'At the least, the court should be extremely wary, as it usually is, of upending long-settled precedent. The Abood ruling has stood, and been repeatedly reaffirmed, for nearly 40 years. It would be'b' troubling'b' if it was now reversed by a deeply divided vote.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 IT\xe2\x80\x99S hard to say which of the three monomaniacal, monumentally grueling quests is the most riveting.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s the torturous trek portrayed in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Revenant\xe2\x80\x9d of Hugh Glass, a 19th-'b''b'century trapper who, inflamed by revenge, dragged his bloody body 200 miles through the Western wilderness after being gnawed by a grizzly and deserted by fellow trappers.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the hunt by 'b'Leonardo DiCaprio'b' for his first Oscar, for portraying Glass. He has been on the press circuit dramatizing the agonizing shoot, bragging about his verisimilitude in eating raw bison liver. The director, Alejandro I\xc3\xb1\xc3\xa1rritu, 'b'told Variety'b' he had to fly ants twice, first class, to Calgary so they could crawl over Leo\xe2\x80\x99s fractured frontiersman.'b'Some wags suggested Leo was so eager to inhabit the solitary Glass\xe2\x80\x99s misery that he broke up with Kelly Rohrbach, his latest supermodel girlfriend, because she was bringing a frivolity to the saturnine mood of the promotional effort by taking the bouncy Pamela Anderson role in the new \xe2\x80\x9cBaywatch\xe2\x80\x9d movie.'b'And finally, of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s the politician most like Glass in her willingness to crawl through glass, flip her positions and persona, and even bear up under a mauling by a merciless, manic bear to reach that goal most yearned for. In Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s grimly relentless trudge toward the White House, the part of the bear is played by Donald Trump. (The bear in the movie is also a counterpuncher; when Leo tries to shoot the animal in the face, the grizzly races back to molest him again.)'b'Trump is like a CGI 'b'Rathtar'b' or Indominus Rex, a larger-than-life, fight-to-the-death animated creature who improbably pops up in the ordinarily staid presidential campaign and stomps around, devouring attention and sinking his Twitter teeth into rivals. With his muddle of charm, humor, zest, vulgarity, bigotry, opportunistic flexibility, brutal candor, breathtaking boorishness and outrageous opening bids on volatile issues, he has now leapt into that most sensitive area: the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 tangled conjugal life.'b'Hillary was 'b'asked by The Des Moines Register'b' about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s crude comments that she had been trounced (he used a phallic word) by Barack Obama in 2008 and that her prolonged debate bathroom break was \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusting.\xe2\x80\x9d She replied that Trump had a \xe2\x80\x9cpenchant for sexism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That spurred him to declare \xe2\x80\x9copen season\xe2\x80\x9d on the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 seraglio imbroglios. On Thursday, he put out an Instagram ad showing The Daily News cover about Bill, after he admitted the affair with Monica Lewinsky, blaring \xe2\x80\x9cLiar, Liar.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The ad goes straight at what Hillary sees as her strengths: Bill and running as a woman. Playing her famous line in Beijing in 1995 that \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s rights are human rights,\xe2\x80\x9d it features pictures of the Clintons with \xe2\x80\x9cfriends\xe2\x80\x9d who have been ensnared in seamy scandals \xe2\x80\x94 Bill Cosby and Anthony Weiner, the husband of Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s close aide Huma Abedin.'b'In 1999, when 'b'I interviewed him'b', Trump said of Bill: \xe2\x80\x9cHe handled the Monica situation disgracefully. It\xe2\x80\x99s sad because he would go down as a great president if he had not had this scandal. People would have been more forgiving if he\xe2\x80\x99d had an affair with a really beautiful woman of sophistication. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe were on a different level. Now Clinton can\xe2\x80\x99t get into golf clubs in Westchester. A former president begging to get into a golf club. It\xe2\x80\x99s unthinkable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ignoring our more gender-fluid society, the skyscraper-obsessed Trump has hectored male rivals for being girlie men. But he knows Hillary is tough. So he\xe2\x80\x99s wielding his knife on her most sensitive pressure point: her hypocrisy in running as a feminist icon when she was part of political operations that smeared women who told the truth about Bill\xe2\x80\x99s transgressions. Hillary told friends that Monica was a \xe2\x80\x9ctroubled young person\xe2\x80\x9d getting ministered to by Bill and a \xe2\x80\x9cnarcissistic loony toon.\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s henchman Sidney Blumenthal spread around the story that Monica was a stalker and Charlie Rangel publicly slandered the intern as a fantasist who wasn\xe2\x80\x99t playing with \xe2\x80\x9ca full deck.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Trump may be a politically incorrect Frank Sinatra ring-a-ding type with cascading marriages to hot babes, but he knows that a retrospective of the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 cynical campaigns against \xe2\x80\x9cbimbo eruptions\xe2\x80\x9d will not play well in a politically correct society sensitized by epidemics of rape in colleges and the military and by the Cosby effect.'b'Bill hid behind the skirts of feminists \xe2\x80\x94 including his wife and esteemed women in his cabinet \xe2\x80\x94 when he got caught playing around. And feminists, eager to protect his progressive agenda on women, allowed the women swirling around Bill to become collateral damage, torched as trailer trash or erotomaniacs.'b'In Iowa last fall, Hillary promised to fight sexual assault on campuses, saying that survivors had \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to be heard\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to be believed.\xe2\x80\x9d But when a woman last month asked if the women who claimed they were sexually harassed by Bill Clinton should be believed, Hillary faltered, replying lamely: \xe2\x80\x9cI would say that everybody should be believed at first until they are disbelieved based on evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d She\xe2\x80\x99s in a dicey spot on this, as Trump well knows.'b'Hillary reacted to his ad by tweeting, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important to stand up to bullies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Trump can be a bully. But Hillary was a bully, too, in the way she dealt with her husband\xe2\x80\x99s paramours. Her impulse, as Lewinsky wrote in Vanity Fair, was to blame the woman \xe2\x80\x94 even herself. Hillary was not going to be hurt twice by Those Women, letting them damage her marriage and her political future. If someone had to be collateral damage, it was not going to be Hillary. For now, she will have to deal with that old show business saw: Exit, pursued by a bear.'b'IT is tempting to dismiss the antigovernment gunmen who took control of an animal refuge in Oregon on Jan. 2 as fanatics working at the fringes of American politics. But if the methods used by the rancher Ammon Bundy to seize the federal property were radical, the ideological roots of the operation were somewhat more mainstream.'b'By storming the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge and vowing to return it \xe2\x80\x94 by force of arms, if necessary \xe2\x80\x94 to the people of Harney County, Mr. Bundy and his men were echoing the teachings, if not the tactics, of the Wise Use movement: a conservative land-use doctrine that has been a part of the national discourse for nearly 30 years.'b'A successor to the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s (itself a successor to the anti-national parks Boomers project of the early 1900s), Wise Use answers the question of who should own the West by granting moral primacy to natural resource companies and to logging and ranching families like the Bundys, some of which have worked the land since the pioneer expansion.'b'Though composed of many activists and scores of organizations, Wise Use found its voice in the late 1980s when a timber industry adviser named Ron Arnold published \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wise Use Agenda.\xe2\x80\x9d The manifesto offered an expansive plan to gut environmental regulation, increase private ownership of public land and compel the federal government to open its holdings to mining, oil and logging companies and to the unrestricted use of off-road vehicles.'b'Mr. Arnold adopted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwise use\xe2\x80\x9d from Gifford Pinchot, the first head of the United States Forest Service (who said that \xe2\x80\x9cconservation is the wise use of resources\xe2\x80\x9d). In 1988 he held a conference, bringing together the likes of Exxon and the National Cattlemen\xe2\x80\x99s Association, with the goal of seeding the West with grass-roots groups that could wrest control of federal land and give a local flavor to his Reaganite aims.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cArnold sent organizers into distressed rural communities to set up front groups with environmentally friendly sounding names that whipped up hostility against the government,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tarso Ramos, the executive director of Political Research Associates, a research group that studies right-wing movements. What resulted, Mr. Ramos said, was a \xe2\x80\x9ccoalition of natural-resource companies, property developers and conservative activists working with a network of community organizations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This coalition achieved success in pushing its agenda. By the early 1990s, politicians friendly to the Wise Use cause had introduced or passed legislation in nearly 30 states giving local governments and citizens expanded powers to lay claim to federal land. Among those politicians was Representative Helen Chenoweth-Hage, an Idaho Republican, who became notorious for mocking the Endangered Species Act by holding what she called 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cendangered salmon bakes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' There was also Gale A. Norton, the interior secretary under President George W. Bush, who once worked as a lawyer for the Mountain States Legal Foundation, which has billed itself as \xe2\x80\x9cthe litigation arm of Wise Use.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Wise Use crowd got very close to the centers of power,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ramos said.'b'It also got close to the militia movement, experts say. In 1994, 'b'the National Federal Lands Conference'b', a Wise Use group that maintained that county governments should control federal land, published an article in its newsletter that bore the title \xe2\x80\x9cWhy There Is a Need for the Militia in America.\xe2\x80\x9d Around the same time, Wise Use rallies often featured pamphlets from groups like the Militia of Montana, said David Helvarg, the author of the \xe2\x80\x9cWar Against the Greens.\xe2\x80\x9d Nor was it a coincidence, said James McCarthy, a professor of geography at Clark University, that militia members in camouflage fatigues conducted armed exercises in the very federal forests in New Mexico that the Wise Use movement was trying at the time to pry away from Washington\xe2\x80\x99s control.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere were many people who were active simultaneously in the Wise Use and militia movements and who saw them as different manifestations of the same larger cause,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McCarthy said. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, it is also true that many Wise Use activists were uncomfortable with the militia coming into their fold.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an email titled, \xe2\x80\x9cWise Use and property rights activists v. Wackos,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Arnold denied that his movement was connected to men like Ammon Bundy, who stood down the government two years ago in a similar engagement over cattle-grazing rights at his father\xe2\x80\x99s ranch in Nevada. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see any Wise Use-ish \xe2\x80\x98doctrine\xe2\x80\x99 in anything that\xe2\x80\x99s been called \xe2\x80\x98patriot militia,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Arnold wrote.'b'And yet the question stands as to why vigilantes with AR-15 rifles have repeatedly confronted the government on behalf of local landowners in the West \xe2\x80\x94 a classic Wise Use principle, if not a Wise Use tactic. This spring, gunmen from the Oath Keepers militia group 'b'helped the owners of an Oregon gold mine chase away federal agents'b' who were trying to enforce a stop-work order. A few months later, another Oath Keeper tactical team stopped the government from 'b'shutting down a mine in a national forest in Montana'b'.'b'Part of the answer is that, in a region where the ground itself is largely owned by agencies in Washington, the Wise Use and militia movements share \xe2\x80\x9cthe same seething resentment at federal overreach,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeffrey St. Clair, a journalist who has written about environmental politics in the West for 30 years. If the Wise Use movement did not condone or support militias, it created an intellectual framework for militia operations and has, on occasion, lent the groups ideological ballast. \xe2\x80\x9cIn some way,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. St. Clair said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe patriot movement is glomming onto the Wise Use movement as something that has a political presence and a real-world power\xe2\x80\x9d that the patriot movement \xe2\x80\x9chas never had.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After the Bush years, the Wise Use movement lost much of its vibrancy, and even Mr. Arnold acknowledged that it is little known today. But the relationship between activists in suits and angry men with guns continues. Last year, Michele Fiore, a Republican assemblywoman in Nevada, 'b'introduced a bill 'b'to prohibit the federal government from owning or managing land in Nevada without the state\xe2\x80\x99s consent. Ms. Fiore, as it happens, is also a strong supporter of the Bundys. A month after her bill was introduced, 'b'she debated Chris Hayes on MSNBC'b', live from the standoff at the Bundy family ranch.'b'To Mr. Ramos, the researcher, ties like these can be awkward at best.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Bundys and other militia groups are rife with Wise Use rhetoric about federal land,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a situation where business-oriented people see utility in rising militancy \xe2\x80\x94 until it spins out of control and creates huge liabilities for them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xc3\x81vila, Spain \xe2\x80\x94 I made the mistake of falling for a man who wants a wife. I should clarify that I do not mean he wants 'b'me'b' to be his wife. Men don\xe2\x80\x99t look at me and think I\xe2\x80\x99d make good wife material. Maybe because of how much I swear. But I go to Berlin to see him, he tells me his future plans for marriage and family, and I understand that I am not compatible with those plans. Then I flee, to huddle in the backs of cathedrals, an impulse that I do not fully understand.'b'I am not Catholic, and yet I find myself drawn to the women saints. There is something about them that I admire. Maybe it is simply the lengths to which they went to avoid marrying. When St. Catherine\xe2\x80\x99s mother said her hair would surely attract a good suitor, she cut all of it off. When St. Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s pursuer said she had lovely eyes, she cut them out and presented them to him. (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat,\xe2\x80\x9d I imagine her asking him as he screamed. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought you said you liked them.\xe2\x80\x9d) Then there\xe2\x80\x99s St. Olga of Kiev, whose feast day is my birthday. Emissaries came to her and suggested she marry their prince. She had them all buried alive.'b'After another disastrous visit with the man in Berlin, I got on a plane and came to \xc3\x81vila, Spain, on a pilgrimage to St. Teresa, the 16th-century mystic nun and philosopher. The town was celebrating her 500th birthday with banners of her poetry and a whole year of events. She did not have to remove any body parts to stay unmarried, nor murder scores of men. She did have to defy her family, though. As well as what she thought she wanted out of life, which was love. But she had watched her mother slowly die through pregnancy after pregnancy, her body weakening with each child, and she saw that this was her wifely duty.'b'Teresa did not want to be reduced to merely a body, bred and sacrificed for the sake of her husband and children. If she had to choose between being a body and a brain, she would choose to be a brain. So she entered the church \xe2\x80\x94 the only way a woman could become a philosopher.'b'I am in \xc3\x81vila instead of at home, because my sister is in my home. A sister who, after 15 years of sacrificing all of her dreams, her comforts, her desires to a husband that she supported financially and emotionally, suddenly woke up and found she had nothing left, not even an idea of what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. After leaving him, she also had no home. So I opened my door to her.'b'This is my family default, or the default for the women: the sacrifice of everything for the husband. Women in my family have given up homes, friends, careers, the pursuit of advanced degrees within months of completion to become housewives, stay-at-home moms, or to work in jobs they never would have chosen to pay their male partner\xe2\x80\x99s way.'b'I understand that this was my female relatives\xe2\x80\x99 choice. Yet I also know how infrequently you truly make the choice to sacrifice something you love; it\xe2\x80\x99s more like a slow erosion. You give up one small thing, which makes it easier then to give up another, then another. After all, the men didn\xe2\x80\x99t ask them to make these sacrifices \xe2\x80\x94 asking that would require their acknowledgment there was something of value to give up.'b'And so my sister is haunting my spare bedroom, moving like a ghost of her former self, and here I am in \xc3\x81vila.'b'It is wonderful and rare to be in a city centered on a woman writer. There are many statues and sculptures of St. Teresa throughout the town, and most have fresh roses dropped into her lap every day. In almost all of them, she is holding a quill. Fresh cookies, frosted in her likeness, fill the windows of the bakeries.'b'Everything in town is named after her. The plaza, the streets, the schools, the churches, the cafes, the parking facilities.'b'And yet during her life, she did not have an easy time being taken seriously by the church establishment. She lived during an era when criticizing the church\xe2\x80\x99s riches could get you labeled a heretic and set on fire. The city of \xc3\x81vila participated in such purges, in the town square now renamed for Teresa.'b'Her book \xe2\x80\x9cLife\xe2\x80\x9d got her called before the Inquisition to investigate whether her teachings lined up with the era\xe2\x80\x99s strict orthodoxy. Many of her writings were radical, but she used charm to convince her inquisitors that she was harmless. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what do I know, I am just a wretched woman.\xe2\x80\x9d She advocated for reform, and in her convents the emphasis was on piety, poverty and charity. And while her books were originally intended only for clergy and her fellow nuns, after her death they were published widely.'b'She wrote volumes, about the role of women, about compassion, about the power of art, about living through dark times. She was a philosopher, and yet even today she is rarely mentioned in philosophy survey classes and rarely listed with her brothers Spinoza, Descartes, Aquinas, Kant and others.'b'Likewise, St. Teresa, this woman who suggested the church return to a more humble state instead of flaunting its outrageous wealth, had her body broken up after her death and her parts wrapped up in gold and jewels. Her finger relic here in \xc3\x81vila carries an emerald ring, and the rope she used to flog herself is encased in gold. She fought her whole life to be a brain, but with the church performing miracles with her bones she\xe2\x80\x99s now back to being just a body.'b'The writing of St. Teresa\xe2\x80\x99s that I am most interested in is on the creation of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s life, outside of a life with a man. Her account of building convents across Spain, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Book of Her Foundations,\xe2\x80\x9d is essentially her argument that such lives are important. She sometimes tired of the younger nuns, writing that they \xe2\x80\x9cdo not recognize the great favor God has granted them in ... freeing them from being subject to a man who is often the death of them and who could also be, God forbid, the death of their souls.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Five hundred years after St. Teresa, and there are still very few models for women of how to live outside of coupledom, whether that is the result of a choice or just bad luck. I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the last time I saw a television show or a film about a single woman, unless her single status was a problem to be solved or an illustration of how deeply damaged she was. This continues even as more and more women are staying single longer and longer.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been single for the most part going on 11 years now, and so I have heard every derogatory, patronizing, demeaning thing said about single women. \xe2\x80\x9cThere has to be 'b'someone'b' for you,\xe2\x80\x9d a married woman friend once said exasperatedly after I recounted another bad date. Implying, unconsciously, that there must be one man somewhere on the planet who could stand to be around me for more than a few days at a time.'b'And so it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get people to understand why a woman would ever choose to live a life alone. We no longer have to choose between being a brain and a body, but I can\xe2\x80\x99t help but think that we lose something when we couple up, and maybe that thing is worth preserving. I pointed out to a different friend that it was the nuns who were the most socially engaged, working with the world\xe2\x80\x99s most vulnerable. My friend, married, asked \xe2\x80\x9cas devil\xe2\x80\x99s advocate\xe2\x80\x9d whether they were simply compensating for the lack of romantic love and children with their social concern. Yes, I said, maybe. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we all have needs that aren\xe2\x80\x99t met, and we\xe2\x80\x99re all looking for substitutes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Every morning in \xc3\x81vila, I walk from my tiny hotel room into the walled part of the city, where another St. Teresa statue stands on her pedestal, overlooking the gates. The town is small, so there is not much to do that isn\xe2\x80\x99t spiritual contemplation or sitting in the sun with a cup of coffee and pastry. There are nuns about during the day, walking in twos, eating gelato and chattering away.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve traveled with romantic partners before. I had a companion at dinner, so I talked to strangers less. I had someone reading the map, so I wandered down unmarked streets less. It felt cozy, both comfortable and confining.'b'I understand loneliness, as do the many women I know who are building lives on their own. But loneliness and vulnerability can be tools, if you can stand the pressure of them. Loneliness awakens not only your attention, as you scan rooms in the hopes of finding someone to alleviate it, but it also drives your empathy. One friend, a political activist in Romania, writes, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m afraid of many things, but loneliness is not among them, and it\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite depressing to have to witness the lengths most people are willing to go just to avoid being alone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I have wandered the streets of \xc3\x81vila for two weeks now, and other than a stuttering conversation in my middling Spanish with the woman who sold me cava and sheep\xe2\x80\x99s cheese, my communication has been online with my friends, mostly women, whom I met all over the world. And I wonder how fewer of them I would have met had I been traveling with the man I fell for. But then, if I had that man, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have felt compelled to come to \xc3\x81vila at all.'b'St. Teresa\xe2\x80\x99s poetry shows a woman who is desperate for meaning. She wants her sacrifices to mean something. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do You want from me?\xe2\x80\x9d her poem refrains. I feel the question calling in me, too.'b'I leave the cold confines of the church to buy roses for St. Teresa, and I head back out into the world.'b'IS it possible to think scientifically and creatively at once? Can you be both a psychologist and a writer?'b'When you look at the world as a psychologist, you see it as a set of phenomena that can be subjected to scientific inquiry: identified, tested and either verified or discarded. When you look at the world as a writer, you see it as a set of phenomena to be captured, contemplated, transformed and set down for others to recognize and absorb.'b'Although it\xe2\x80\x99s often presented as a dichotomy (the apparent subjectivity of the writer versus the seeming objectivity of the psychologist), it need not be. In fact, as I realized when I left the world of psychology behind to become that horror of all horrors (to an academic psychologist) \xe2\x80\x94 someone who wrote for a general audience \xe2\x80\x94 that neat separation is not just unwarranted; it\xe2\x80\x99s destructive.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA writer must be as objective as a chemist,\xe2\x80\x9d Anton Chekhov wrote in 1887. \xe2\x80\x9cHe must abandon the subjective line; he must know that dung heaps play a very reasonable part in a landscape.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Chekhov\xe2\x80\x99s chemist is a naturalist \xe2\x80\x94 someone who sees reality for what it is, rather than what it should be. In that sense, the starting point of the psychologist and the writer is the same: a curiosity that leads you to observe life in all its dimensions. Only in writing, you have the flexibility to explore the implications of your observations without the immediate necessity of experimental design.'b'Depending on whom you ask, 'b'Sigmund Freud'b' was either a pioneer who made much of modern psychology possible or a villain who was wholly misguided. The same mind advanced the field in unanticipated ways (Freud was decades ahead, for instance, when it came to defense mechanisms) and pushed it in a direction that seems, at best, simplistic (his insistence on sexuality as the cause of everything led to a number of therapies with little empirical grounding that are still in use to this day). How is that possible?'b'At the turn of the century, psychology was a field quite unlike what it is now. The theoretical musings of William James were the norm (a wry commenter once noted that William James was the writer, and his brother Henry, the psychologist). Psychologists could theorize without the immediate need for quantification, although in James\xe2\x80\x99s case he did establish one of the first psychological laboratories in the United States. Freud was a breed of psychologist that hardly exists anymore: someone who saw the world as both writer and psychologist, and for whom there was no conflict between the two. That boundary melding allowed him to posit the existence of cognitive mechanisms that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be empirically proved for decades, but it also led him astray in problematic, ultimately hurtful ways.'b'Freud got it brilliantly right and brilliantly wrong. The rightness is as good a justification as any of the benefits, the necessity even, of knowing how to look through the eyes of a writer. The wrongness is part of the reason that the distinction between writing and experimental psychology has grown far more rigid than it was a century ago.'b'When I was working on 'b'my new book'b', I discovered a pervasive set of folk theories about liars. Most were not as extreme as the profile of a poisoner from a 900 B.C. Vedic papyrus I chanced upon \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHe does not answer questions, or gives evasive answers; he speaks nonsense, rubs the great toe along the ground, and shivers; his face is discolored; he rubs the roots of his hair with his fingers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but they did include a number of strands that will be familiar to any aficionado of the police procedural.'b'When an international team of researchers asked some 2,300 people in 58 countries to respond to a single question \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you tell when people are lying?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 one sign stood out: In two-thirds of responses, people listed gaze aversion. A liar doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look you in the eye. Twenty-eight percent reported that liars seemed nervous, a quarter reported incoherence, and another quarter that liars exhibited certain little giveaway motions.'b'It just so happens that the common wisdom is false \xe2\x80\x94 and we need psychologists in order to make that determination. What researchers who study ways of detecting deception, like Leanne ten Brinke, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley, will tell you is that the signs people associate with liars often have little empirical evidence to support them. Therein lies the psychologist\xe2\x80\x99s distinct role and her necessity. As a writer, you look in order to describe, but you remain free to use that description however you see fit. As a psychologist, you look to describe, yes, but also to verify.'b'Without verification, we can\xe2\x80\x99t always trust what we see \xe2\x80\x94 or rather, what we think we see. Whether we\xe2\x80\x99re psychologists or writers (or anything else), our eyes are never the impartial eyes of Chekhov\xe2\x80\x99s chemist. Our expectations, our wants and shoulds, get in the way. Take, once again, lying. Why do we think we know how liars behave? Liars should divert their eyes. They should feel ashamed and guilty and show the signs of discomfort that such feelings engender. And because they should, we think they do.'b'The desire for the world to be what it ought to be and not what it is permeates experimental psychology as much as writing, though. There\xe2\x80\x99s experimental bias and the problem known in the field as \xe2\x80\x9cdemand characteristics\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 when researchers end up finding what they want to find by cuing participants to act a certain way. It\xe2\x80\x99s also visible when psychologists choose to study one thing rather than another, dismiss evidence that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mesh with their worldview while embracing that which does. The subjectivity we tend to associate with the writerly way of looking may simply be more visible in that realm rather than exclusive to it.'b'IN 1932, when he was in his 70s, Freud gave a series of lectures on psychoanalysis. In his final talk, \xe2\x80\x9cA Philosophy of Life,\xe2\x80\x9d he focused on clarifying an important caveat to his research: His followers should not be confused by the seemingly internal, and thus possibly subjective, nature of his work. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no other source of knowledge of the universe but the intellectual manipulation of carefully verified observations,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Intuition and inspiration, he went on, \xe2\x80\x9ccan safely be counted as illusions, as fulfillments of wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d They are not to be relied on as evidence of any sort. \xe2\x80\x9cScience takes account of the fact that the mind of man creates such demands and is ready to trace their source, but it has not the slightest ground for thinking them justified.\xe2\x80\x9d Freud may have looked as a writer, but as a psychologist he had learned to distrust what he saw.'b'That is what both the psychologist and the writer should strive for: a self-knowledge that allows you to look in order to discover, without agenda, without preconception, without knowing or caring if what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing is wrong or right in your scheme of the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s harder than it sounds. For one thing, you have to possess the self-knowledge that will allow you to admit when you\xe2\x80\x99re wrong.'b'Even with the best intentions, objectivity can prove a difficult companion. I left psychology behind because I found its structural demands overly hampering. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just pursue interesting lines of inquiry; I had to devise a set of experiments, see how feasible they were, both technically and financially, consider how they would reflect on my career. That meant that most new inquiries never happened \xe2\x80\x94 in a sense, it meant that objectivity was more an ideal than a reality. Each study was selected for a reason other than intrinsic interest.'b'I became a writer to pursue that intrinsic interest. But I do so having never quite left the thinking of the psychologist behind: I still design studies in my head, think through implications, attempt to apply an experimental rigor to even the most creative of my writing. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s the combination that brings me closer to my ideal of observation. Isolation precludes objectivity. It\xe2\x80\x99s in the merging not simply of ways of seeing but also of modes of thought that a truly whole perception of reality may eventually emerge. Or at least that way we can realize its ultimate impossibility \xe2\x80\x94 and that\xe2\x80\x99s not nothing, either.'b'Though it would have been inconceivable just a few years ago, among the most popular gifts this past holiday season was the drone. Increasingly coveted by hobbyists and businesses, these devices flew (as it were) off the shelves and into living rooms by the hundreds of thousands.'b'But as drones have become smaller, cheaper and more numerous \xe2\x80\x94 some popular consumer models 'b'sell for less than $1,000'b' \xe2\x80\x94 policy makers have had to address potential problems. These machines can obviously be put to good use \xe2\x80\x94 say, inspecting cellphone towers, shooting movies or compiling multidimensional real estate portfolios. They can also be used to snoop on people and harass them. And they can threaten other aircraft.'b'Some regulation of the private and commercial use of drones thus seems inevitable. The task for regulators is how to protect privacy and promote safety without infringing on the First Amendment rights of citizens and businesses that wish to use drones for legitimates purposes, like photography or news gathering (The Times has used drones to shoot videos and take photographs).'b'The Federal Aviation Administration has taken the lead in regulating drones. Last month, it started requiring users to 'b'register their unmanned aircraft'b'. It has also 'b'proposed rules 'b' that would limit drone flights to daylight hours and require commercial users of small drones to keep their aircraft within their sight.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s too restrictive, according to some businesses that make drones and companies that want to use them. But the agency\xe2\x80\x99s approach is measured and makes sense for a new technology, especially given reports of near collisions with helicopters and airplanes taking off or landing.'b'The F.A.A. is not equipped to regulate another big drone-related issue: privacy. There is no question that many Americans are concerned; 63 percent of people 'b'surveyed'b' by the Pew Research Center and Smithsonian magazine in 2014 said allowing private and commercial drones into the American airspace could cause harm. Some worry that drones will be used to 'b'peer through windows'b' and into normally protected spaces like 'b'backyards'b'. These are not new concerns. In 1946, in a case involving airplane takeoffs and landings over a farm, the Supreme Court 'b'ruled'b' that people should have control over \xe2\x80\x9cthe immediate reaches of the enveloping atmosphere\xe2\x80\x9d above their properties.'b'Many privacy advocates are also worried that drones used by businesses will collect information like wireless signals emitted by cellphones that could be used to determine people\xe2\x80\x99s locations. One marketing company 'b'did just that'b' in a test last year in Los Angeles.'b'President Obama has 'b'ordered the Commerce Department'b' to work with industry and privacy groups to come up with a set of best practices for drone use that are expected to be voluntary. States and cities are more aggressive. Lawmakers in California, Texas, Los Angeles, 'b'Miami'b' and elsewhere have passed laws that limit where drones can be flown and how they can be used. Texas, for example, 'b'forbids'b' the use of drones to take photographs of people or real estate. Exceptions include crime investigations and the marketing of properties by brokers.'b'The public\xe2\x80\x99s desire for clear rules is understandable. Still, policy makers should not make it so difficult to use drones that they end up limiting the First Amendment rights of filmmakers, activists and journalists. The Texas law, for example, does not include an exception 'b'for news gathering'b'.'b'Drones provide one more reason for Congress to approve a broad consumer privacy bill giving Americans more control over what businesses collect about them and how they use it. Such legislation would apply to data collection by websites and by drones. Privacy legislation proposed by President Obama 'b'in 2012'b' has been thwarted by companies that collect and use private data.'b'Unmanned aircraft can be incredibly useful. But many Americans will be skeptical of them unless safeguards are put in place guaranteeing safety and protecting privacy.'b'I RECENTLY visited a big-box electronics store, and decided to test-ride a hoverboard.'b'An avid skateboarder for nearly 30 years, I was a skeptic. No skateboard had ever caught fire, as 'b'one Fit Turbo hoverboard did,'b' while its cheap lithium-ion batteries were charging, badly damaging a family\xe2\x80\x99s Louisiana home. But in my buttoned-up life as the father of two young boys, on the doorstep of 40, with a dwindling cultural relevance that has only recently become apparent to me, I was curious about the hoverboard\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI stand for our generation and our generation is gonna be riding hoverboards,\xe2\x80\x9d the rapper Wiz Khalifa tweeted last year. He\xe2\x80\x99s performed shows on a hoverboard, and, heroically, was subject to a police takedown at Los Angeles International Airport for refusing to dismount.'b'Skateboarding was once dismissed as a fad as well, wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Had I become a crank? A nostalgic? A believer that all the truly cool things lay behind us?'b'The hoverboards were back near the big-ticket appliances. Finding most salespeople occupied, I hailed a young man stocking a nearby cellphone case display.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNormally, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really let people try them?\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cOn account of legality issues?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not confident about many things, but one thing I\xe2\x80\x99ve got going for me is rock-solid balance, laser-calibrated by three decades spent rolling around on a skateboard. I looked down at the shelf-stocker\xe2\x80\x99s shoes, which were made by a skateboard company that had once sponsored me. The gray suede was worn whitish over his left pinkie toe. He was regular-footed, just like I am.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDude, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been skateboarding forever,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, projecting as much youthful-yet-weary camaraderie as I could muster. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pretty sure I got this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., just for a sec,\xe2\x80\x9d he acquiesced, probably sensing the possibility of scoring a healthy commission on the $400 price tag should I choose to take one home.'b'He reached into a lockable compartment, produced a demo hoverboard, turned the thing on, and set it before me.'b'It was a Sologear, the electric blue of Cookie Monster\xe2\x80\x99s fur. I nudged it with my toe as if it were some futuristic roadkill.'b'The hoverboard has no natural resting state \xe2\x80\x94 much like the unicycle \xe2\x80\x94 so there is simply no way to mount it with any semblance of grace. It\xe2\x80\x99s an all or nothing proposition. Check out the Twitter feed @HoverBoardFalls, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll see that a majority of crashes take place seconds into the ride. After some Bambi-on-ice wobbling, the hoverboard zips forward and a sad procession of human beings are chucked back onto their butts.'b'I placed one shoe on the footpad and applied some weight. Doing so, I realized that the hoverboard has trouble distinguishing between a person mounting it and the toe-pressure command for a hard left, which is exactly what it did. To counteract the motion I executed a series of dorky, one-footed hops, chasing the board around the store. Mostly to put an end to this spectacle, I jumped for it.'b'My foot connected with the other footpad and I was up, blue lights flaring beneath my toes.'b'Every boxer, dancer, surfer, snowboarder or skateboarder knows that the human body is at its most stable when turned sideways, knees slightly bent, feet well-spaced apart. Because we don\xe2\x80\x99t have toes protruding from our heels, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to balance on the front-back axis.'b'So why did the designers of the hoverboard force its riders into the weakest possible kinesiological position? Rod-straight, knees locked, forward facing, a stance from which even the sturdiest person could be knocked over by a toddler with a good head of steam?'b'In snowboarding vernacular there\xe2\x80\x99s a phenomenon referred to as \xe2\x80\x9crolling down the windows.\xe2\x80\x9d A boarder leaves a jump and immediately starts winging both arms in wide circles (as though manually rolling down two old-fashioned car windows), with the aim of righting herself midair and evading grievous harm. Well, \xe2\x80\x9crolling down the windows\xe2\x80\x9d was exactly what I was doing when I sent a Bluetooth speaker clattering to the floor.'b'When I finally captured my balance, I began experimenting with the subtleties of toe control. The servo motors seemed to be timed just a fraction of a second off, but soon I got the hang of it, and started executing tidy pirouettes near some stainless steel fridges.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re actually pretty sick,\xe2\x80\x9d the guy said.'b'I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t agree more. I 'b'had'b' been too quick to judge. Walking was outdated. A new mode of living flashed before my eyes: me at the vanguard of the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal transportation revolution.\xe2\x80\x9d I, too, would \xe2\x80\x9cstand for our generation,\xe2\x80\x9d Wiz Khalifa!'b'But no welter of optimism could fill the seam in the floor that allowed rolling partitions to be drawn across the store. In this crevasse my wheels locked and I went irreversibly, perilously, horizontal.'b'I could almost hear them, my comrades of @HoverBoardFalls, in their living rooms still littered with Christmas wrapping paper, stepping onto their brand-new $400 banana peels. I could hear their heads, elbows, hips hit the floor, just as mine did now, with a hot spear of pain.'b'I handed the kid the board. And then I limped toward the doors and the safety of the past.'b'IN recent months, the Obama administration has been locked in a battle with Representative Lamar Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology, who disputes the scientific consensus on climate change.'b'After the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published a study last summer showing that climate change has continued unabated and perhaps accelerated over the last 15 years, Mr. Smith subpoenaed the emails of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s scientists, citing whistle-blowers who say that the study had been rushed to publication.'b'NOAA has denied this request, and some within the scientific community have called Mr. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s demands a witch hunt. But allowing agencies to keep secret the communications of scientists who work for the government sets a dangerous precedent. Some of what we know about abusive practices in science \xe2\x80\x94 whether it concerns tobacco, pharmaceuticals, chemicals or even climate change \xe2\x80\x94 has come from reading scientists\xe2\x80\x99 emails.'b'Around 2007, for instance, the Senate Finance Committee sought emails and documents from several companies and agencies and about a dozen academic research centers as part of a wide-ranging investigation of possible corruption in medical research.'b'The committee later released a report detailing emails from scientists at GlaxoSmithKline showing that the company sought to intimidate academic researchers and hide the'b' potential dangers'b' of the diabetes drug Avandia. Internal communications by scientists at the Food and Drug Administration showed they had estimated Avandia was causing 'b'hundreds of heart attacks'b' and instances of heart failure each month.'b'And if you think of all scientists at universities as pure at heart, think again.'b'As federal funding has fallen, some university scientists have allied themselves with corporate interests. In one instance, congressional investigators caught a scientist at the University of Texas 'b'leaking a study'b' that he was peer reviewing for a medical journal to a corporate sponsor. Separate investigations by the Senate caught scientists allowing companies to 'b'edit'b' their journal articles, 'b'prepare 'b'their testimony before the F.D.A. and secretly pay them to 'b'testify'b' before the Senate. These investigations, based in part on a review of emails, helped catalyze reforms requiring the government and universities to become more transparent in their research practices.'b'Through freedom of information requests asking for scientists\xe2\x80\x99 emails and documents, the public has learned, for instance, that Coca-Cola funded academics 'b'to play down'b' the link between bad diets and obesity. Disclosure of emails also revealed that a prominent critic of climate change at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics 'b'described many'b' of his scientific papers as \xe2\x80\x9cdeliverables\xe2\x80\x9d to his corporate funders.'b'But don\xe2\x80\x99t try to explain this to many scientists. The scientific community loves to toss around the term \xe2\x80\x9ctransparency,\xe2\x80\x9d but it mostly remains a buzzword.'b'Last August, a colleague and I 'b'wrote an article'b' on the importance of transparency in science for one of the blogs of the science journal publisher PLOS. The argument was fairly simple: When research is paid for by the public, the public has a right to demand transparency and to have access to documents related to the research. This might strike most people as reasonable.'b'One of our examples focused on a small nonprofit, 'b'U.S. Right to Know'b', which advocates for the labeling of food containing genetically modified organisms. The group filed Freedom of Information requests seeking the correspondence of scientists at public universities, some of whom wrote for a website backed by the agrochemical industry.'b'Our article promptly came under attack by several scientists and by the Union of Concerned Scientists. PLOS then removed our article from its site, though left the comments about it online. Never mind that the article had been peer-reviewed and promoted on social media by PLOS. In removing the article, PLOS explained that it \xe2\x80\x9cwas not consistent with at least the spirit and intent of our community guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'About two weeks later, this newspaper, in a Page 1 article, underscored the importance of access to scientists\xe2\x80\x99 emails. Based in part on emails that had been sought by U.S. Right to Know, The Times reported that university scientists had become part of \xe2\x80\x9can inner circle of industry consultants, lobbyists and executives who devised strategy on how to block state efforts to mandate G.M.O. labeling.\xe2\x80\x9d Similar articles appeared in The 'b'Boston Globe'b' and in 'b'Bloomberg Business'b'.'b'As interest groups on both the left and right increasingly try to politicize the scientific process, there\xe2\x80\x99s little question that there will be misuse of the Freedom of Information laws that some journalists and watchdog organizations have used to uncover wrongdoing.'b'Scientists have been harassed in the past and no doubt will continue to be harassed in the future, just like other public servants. You can argue that Mr. Smith\xe2\x80\x99s broadsides against NOAA are a case in point. In turn, scientists are free to fight these information requests or seek to narrow the scope of the inquiries to protect against what they believe threatens the integrity of the scientific process or chills research.'b'But the harassment argument should not be used as an excuse to bar access to scientific research that the public is paying for and has a legitimate interest in seeing.'b'Whenever scientists argue against transparency, they inevitably tie themselves up in contradictions.'b'After PLOS removed our article, a regular contributor to one of PLOS\xe2\x80\x99s blogs requested that a university disclose the results of a recent study. The university rebuffed his request, claiming that disclosing the results 'b'could cause'b' \xe2\x80\x9charassment and distress to staff.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'NOAA, too, has found itself on both sides of the transparency debate.'b'About 10 years ago, the agency released emails showing that officials in the administration of George W. Bush 'b'squashed'b' a NOAA statement and that Bush 'b'political appointees'b' were selecting which NOAA scientists could speak to the media based on their willingness to deny connections between climate change and hurricane activity.'b'The emails released by the agency also included ones from NOAA\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'own scientists. They'b' complained to their superiors that the agency was misrepresenting hurricane science, and that NOAA had published inaccurate information on its website regarding links between hurricanes and climate change.'b'This information helped persuade congressional leaders to start investigations into the Bush administration\xe2\x80\x99s distortion of federal research.'b'Scientists who profess agreement with transparency only when it is on their terms are really not for transparency at all. The public should be alarmed.'b'IN a typical presidential campaign, the most successful candidates lay claim to leadership with their high-mindedness. They reach for poetry. They focus on lifting people up, not tearing them down. They beseech voters to be their biggest, best selves.'b'Not the two front-runners in this freaky Republican primary. They\xe2\x80\x99re unreservedly smug. They\xe2\x80\x99re unabashedly mean.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re not with them, you\xe2\x80\x99re a loser (Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s declaration) or you\xe2\x80\x99re godless (Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s decree, more or less). They market name-calling as truth-telling, pettiness as boldness, vanity as conviction. And their tandem success suggests a dynamic peculiar to the 2016 election, a special rule for this road:'b'Obnoxiousness is the new charisma.'b'Sure, we\xe2\x80\x99ve had contenders like them before. But two on top at the same time? And two with this degree of stridency, this deficit of dignity?'b'Cruz just finished up a dominant week, besting Trump in a poll of California Republicans, drawing swarms of reporters to his bus tour through Iowa, prompting ever surer predictions of triumph in that state.'b'He \xe2\x80\x9chas plainly become the candidate to beat in the caucuses,\xe2\x80\x9d Jonathan Martin and Matt Flegenheimer wrote 'b'in The Times'b', sketching a scenario in which \xe2\x80\x9che could also quickly become something else: the de facto party nominee.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Iowa part isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly surprising. In the previous two election cycles, the top spot went to a Republican who courted evangelical Christians by leaning hard on religion, which Cruz mentions so often and so operatically that he might as well be waging a holy war instead of a political campaign.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStrap on the full armor of God,\xe2\x80\x9d he reportedly exhorted campaign volunteers during a New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve conference call, readying them for attacks from his rivals. At a Christian conference in Iowa in November, he told the audience: \xe2\x80\x9cAny president who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t begin every day on his knees isn\xe2\x80\x99t fit to be commander in chief of this country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But neither the 2008 nor 2012 winners of the caucuses (Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, respectively) took a tone as distinctively and consistently bratty as Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s, which was distilled in his remarks the day after President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s tearful address about gun violence.'b'Making light of so much bloodshed, Cruz 'b'told Iowans'b' the story of a Texas woman who was pulled over by a police officer. She supposedly informed the officer that she had a Glock affixed to her hip, a .38 revolver in one boot, a single-shot derringer in the other and a double-barrel shotgun under the seat.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGoodness gracious,\xe2\x80\x9d the officer said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat on earth are you afraid of?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot a dang thing,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman responded.'b'Cruz is unsettling enough in isolation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s the combination of him and Trump that really galls. And it galls not just Democrats but other Republicans.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt some point, we have to deal with the fact that there are at least two candidates who could utterly destroy the Republican bench for a generation if they became the nominee,\xe2\x80\x9d Josh Holmes, a former chief of staff to the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, told Politico\xe2\x80\x99s Alex Isenstadt recently.'b'The headline on Isenstadt\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'story 'b' was \xe2\x80\x9cTrump and Cruz send shivers down G.O.P. spines.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the current issue of Time magazine, David Von Drehle put it this way: \xe2\x80\x9cThe G.O.P. has awakened less than a month from the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary to find itself in bed between a bombshell and a kamikaze.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a king-size bed, and they\xe2\x80\x99re all under an eiderdown of obnoxiousness.'b'From the moment Trump announced his candidacy, he chose a potty mouth over a silver tongue, and a shocking number of Americans thrilled to that, regarding crudeness as the greatest form of candor.'b'From the moment Cruz arrived in the United States Senate, he chose tirades over teamwork, becoming \xe2\x80\x9cso unpopular that at one point not a single Republican senator would support his demand for a roll-call vote,\xe2\x80\x9d The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Jennifer Steinhauer 'b'wrote'b' last month, adding that he was left \xe2\x80\x9cstanding on the Senate floor like a man with bird flu, everyone scattering to avoid him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But what repelled Republican senators is somehow beckoning Republican voters: In a Gallup 'b'survey'b' released on Friday, 61 percent of them said that they had a favorable impression of him, while only 16 percent said that they had an unfavorable one, giving him a \xe2\x80\x9cnet favorable\xe2\x80\x9d rating of plus 45, the best in the Republican field.'b'I guess bird flu is the new catnip.'b'Many analysts explain all of this in terms of a potent anger among Americans. They say Trump and Cruz lend voice to it.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly right. Anger can have a noble dimension \xe2\x80\x94 as a response to injustice, as the grist for change \xe2\x80\x94 and neither Trump nor Cruz projects much nobility or tries to, for that matter. They\xe2\x80\x99re not so much angry as petulant, impudent.'b'When Trump tells rivals on the debate stage that they\xe2\x80\x99re ugly or unpopular and when he ridicules a journalist\xe2\x80\x99s disability, he\xe2\x80\x99s not being angry. He\xe2\x80\x99s just being a jerk. And when he crows incessantly about his deal-making genius, his billions and his poll numbers, he\xe2\x80\x99s not stoking constructive passions. He\xe2\x80\x99s just stroking himself.'b'Cruz seems animated less by anger than by scorn. Like Trump he\xe2\x80\x99s proudly divisive.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a courtesy he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t afford the majority of politicians in his own party. They don\xe2\x80\x99t pass his purity test.'b'And they don\xe2\x80\x99t understand, as he and Trump do, that at this crazy, cynical juncture, there\xe2\x80\x99s a band of voters so distrustful of the usual etiquette that they think valor lies in viciousness, integrity in insult. They\xe2\x80\x99re determined to rebel and want the opposite of what they usually get, along with permission to be their smallest, worst selves.'b'Trump and Cruz are only too happy to oblige.'b'Shivers indeed.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'WANT a better 2016? Try thinking more about your impending demise.'b'Years ago on a visit to Thailand, I was surprised to learn that Buddhist monks often contemplate the photos of corpses in various stages of decay. The Buddha himself recommended corpse meditation. \xe2\x80\x9cThis body, too,\xe2\x80\x9d students were taught to say about their own bodies, \xe2\x80\x9csuch is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Paradoxically, this meditation on death is intended as a key to better living. It makes disciples aware of the transitory nature of their own physical lives and stimulates a realignment between momentary desires and existential goals. In other words, it makes one ask, \xe2\x80\x9cAm I making the right use of my scarce and precious life?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, most people suffer grave misalignment. In a 2004 article in the journal Science, a team of scholars, including the Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman, surveyed a group of women to compare 'b'how much satisfaction they derived from their daily activities'b'. Among voluntary activities, we might expect that choices would roughly align with satisfaction. Not so. The women reported deriving more satisfaction from prayer, worship and meditation than from watching television. Yet the average respondent spent more than five times as long watching TV as engaging in spiritual activities.'b'If anything, this study understates the misalignment problem. The American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that, in 2014, 'b'the average American adult spent four times longer watching television'b' than \xe2\x80\x9csocializing and communicating,\xe2\x80\x9d and 20 times longer on TV than on \xe2\x80\x9creligious and spiritual activities.\xe2\x80\x9d The survey did not ask about hours surfing the web, but we can imagine a similar disparity.'b'This misalignment leads to ennui and regret. I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of a friend who was hopelessly addicted to British crossword puzzles (the ones with clues that seem inscrutable to Americans, such as, \xe2\x80\x9cThe portly gentleman ate his cat, backwards\xe2\x80\x9d). A harmless pastime, right? My friend didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so \xe2\x80\x94 he was so racked with guilt after wasting hours that he consulted a psychotherapist about how to quit. (The advice: Schedule a reasonable amount of time for crosswords and stop feeling guilty.)'b'While few people share my friend\xe2\x80\x99s interest, many share his anxiety. Millions have resolved to waste less time in 2016 and have already failed. I imagine some readers of this article are filled with self-loathing because they just wasted 10 minutes on a listicle titled \xe2\x80\x9cCelebrities With Terrible Skin.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some might say that this reveals our true preferences for TV and clickbait over loved ones and God. But I believe it is an error in decision making. Our days tend to be an exercise in distraction. We think about the past and future more than the present; we are mentally in one place and physically in another. Without consciousness, we mindlessly blow the present moment on low-value activities.'b'The secret is not simply a resolution to stop wasting time, however. It is to find a systematic way to raise the scarcity of time to our consciousness.'b'Even if contemplating a corpse is a bit too much, you can still practice some of the Buddha\xe2\x80\x99s wisdom resolving to live as if 2016 were your last year. Then remorselessly root out activities, small and large, that don\xe2\x80\x99t pass the \xe2\x80\x9clast-year test.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are many creative ways to practice this test. For example, if you plan a summer vacation, consider what would you do for a week or two if this were your last opportunity. With whom would you reconnect and spend some time? Would you settle your soul on a silent retreat, or instead spend the time drunk in Canc\xc3\xban, Mexico?'b'If this year were your last, would you spend the next hour mindlessly checking your social media, or would you read something that uplifts you instead? Would you compose a snarky comment on this article, or use the time to call a friend to see how she is doing? Hey, I\xe2\x80\x99m not judging here.'b'Some might think that the last-year test is impractical. As an acquaintance of mine joked, \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had one year to live, I\xe2\x80\x99d run up my credit cards.\xe2\x80\x9d In truth, he probably wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t. 'b'In a new paper'b' in the science journal PLOS One, two psychologists looked at the present value of money when people contemplated death. One might assume that when reminded of death, people would greatly value current spending over future spending. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not how it turned out. Considering death actually made respondents 'b'less'b' likely to want to blow money now than other scenarios did.'b'Will cultivating awareness of the scarcity of your time make you grim and serious? Not at all. In fact, there is some evidence that contemplating death makes you funnier. Two scholars in 2013 published an academic paper 'b'detailing research in which they subliminally primed people to think about either death or pain'b', and then asked them to caption cartoons. Outside raters found the death-primed participants\xe2\x80\x99 captions to be funnier.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s still time to rethink your resolutions. Forget losing weight and saving money. Those are New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolutions for amateurs. This year, improve your alignment, and maybe get funnier in the process: Be fully alive now by meditating on your demise. Happy 2016!'b'SITTWE, Myanmar \xe2\x80\x94 SOON the world will witness a remarkable sight: a beloved 'b'Nobel Peace Prize winner'b' presiding over 21st'b''b'-century concentration camps.'b''b'Daw Aung San Suu Kyi'b', one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s genuine heroes, won democracy for her country, culminating in 'b'historic elections'b' in November that her party won in a landslide. As winner, Aung San Suu Kyi is also inheriting the worst ethnic cleansing you\xe2\x80\x99ve never heard of, 'b'Myanmar'b'\xe2\x80\x99s destruction of a Muslim minority called the Rohingya.'b'A 'b'recent Yale study'b' suggested that the abuse of the more than one million Rohingya may amount to genocide; at the least, a confidential 'b'United Nations'b' report to the Security Council says it may constitute \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes against humanity under international criminal law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet Aung San Suu Kyi seems to plan to continue this Myanmar version of apartheid. She is now a politician, and oppressing a minority like the Rohingya is popular with mostly Buddhist voters.'b'Another Nobel Peace Prize winner, President Obama, who has tremendous influence on Myanmar (and who has 'b'visited twice'b' since his re-election in 2012), isn\xe2\x80\x99t showing much interest, either. Obama and Hillary Clinton helped lure Myanmar to democracy and a pro-Western orbit \xe2\x80\x94 significant achievements \xe2\x80\x94 and it might spoil the parade to fuss too much over 67 quasi-concentration camps in which many Rohingya are confined.'b'What all this means in practical terms is that Muhammad Karim is dead at 14.'b'Muhammad lived in a giant concentration camp with tens of thousands of Rohingya. The government has taken away citizenship and statehood from the Rohingya over the years, and they are deprived of free movement. Muhammad wanted to sneak away by boat, paying human traffickers to join a tide of desperate Rohingya boat people seeking passage to Malaysia. \xe2\x80\x9cWe wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him, because it was too dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d said his mother, Sara Hatu.'b'Then Muhammad suffered a scratch on his heel. Nobody thought much about it, but soon he had trouble opening his jaw.'b'He apparently had caught tetanus. Like most of the children in the concentration camp, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t able to get vaccinations, including a simple tetanus shot.'b'After he got sick, the local medical assistants and the on-and-off clinic couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help him. Finally his mother got special permission for him to leave the camp to be hospitalized, but by then it was too late. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter two days, he came back as a corpse,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother said.'b'A hundred feet from his hut, another family is also mourning. Bildar Begum, a 20-year-old woman, contracted hepatitis A, according to neighbors. Hepatitis A is normally not life-threatening, but she, too, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get the medical help she needed, and so she died late last year, leaving a 2-year-old son, Hirol.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf she was not Rohingya, she would surely still be alive, I can say that 100 percent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Enus Monir, a community leader.'b'And now Hirol is starving: At 28 months, he weighs just 19 pounds. On the World Health Organization weight-to-age sheets, he is off the charts. The minimum on the charts is the third'b''b' percentile, and Hirol is far below that.'b'Some of the families in the camp have substantial savings in the banks in Sittwe a few miles away. But because they have been locked up since 2012, they can\xe2\x80\x99t access their own bank accounts to feed their families.'b'The global response has been pathetic. Partly that\xe2\x80\x99s because Myanmar makes it difficult for aid groups and journalists to see the Rohingya, so that they are largely invisible.'b'The United Nations has been dysfunctional in Myanmar. Another internal U.N. document shared with me (both provided by a critic of U.N. passivity on the issue) warns that U.N. staff members in Myanmar are feuding with one another and it raises \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of possible complicity of the U.N. in potential crimes against humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bravo to advocacy groups like 'b'Human Rights Watch'b', 'b'Fortify Rights'b' and 'b'United to End Genocide'b' that have spotlighted the continuing brutality against the Rohingya. Kudos to humanitarian groups that ease the suffering where the government allows them to: On one large island that I reached by boat, Doctors Without Borders and Save the Children are providing lifelines of health care and education.'b'Yet aid groups have been barred from many areas, and the systematic destruction of the Rohingya remains one of the 21st'b''b' century\xe2\x80\x99s most neglected human rights catastrophes.'b'The Myanmar government is not only oppressing individuals; it is also trying to eradicate the Rohingya people as an ethnic group, by claiming that it does not exist. The authorities don\xe2\x80\x99t use the word Rohingya and claim that these are just illegal immigrants from Bangladesh (this is preposterous; historical documents refer to the Rohingya). In November, the government 'b'arrested five men'b' simply for printing a 2016 calendar making references to the Rohingya as an ethnic group.'b'Aung San Suu Kyi avoids even saying \xe2\x80\x9cRohingya.\xe2\x80\x9d The United States Embassy in Myanmar likewise seems to sidestep the word in its official statements, a cringeworthy capitulation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Obama administration definitely could be doing a lot more,\xe2\x80\x9d said Matthew Smith of Fortify Rights, a human rights group focused on Myanmar. That includes backing an international investigation and pushing Myanmar publicly and privately to take steps to restore citizenship and free movement to the Rohingya, as well as assuring that aid groups are allowed to help them. Other politicians have also been mostly quiet; the issue has barely surfaced at all on the U.S. presidential campaign trail.'b'An enormous amount has gone right in Myanmar in recent years, especially the rise of democracy. But that same rise of democracy has also empowered racist and xenophobic demagoguery, making the problems of the Rohingya harder to solve. In the recent Myanmar elections, Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s party refused to nominate a single Muslim candidate.'b'Aung San Suu Kyi is regarded by many Burmese as too conciliatory toward the Rohingya, because she remains silent rather than denouncing them at every turn. But for those of us who have deeply admired her for years, her willingness to sacrifice principle for political expedience is wrenching to watch.'b'Defenders of Myanmar and of Aung San Suu Kyi note that the country has many problems; they see the Rohingya as one misfortune in a nation with a vast swath of misfortunes. The priorities, as they see them, are economic development, democracy and an end to the country\xe2\x80\x99s many local conflicts, and they protest that it\xe2\x80\x99s myopic to focus on the problems of one ethnic group in a nation so full of challenges.'b'Yet to me, there is something particularly horrifying about a government deliberately targeting an ethnic group for destruction, locking its members in concentration camps and denying them livelihood, education and health care. When kids are dying in concentration camps, after being confined there because of their ethnicity, that\xe2\x80\x99s not just one more problem of global poverty. It\xe2\x80\x99s a crime against humanity, and addressing it is the responsibility of all humanity.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 AS someone who has spent most of the past 25 years of his professional life in the United States government, think tanks and academia trying to stop the North Korean nuclear weapons program, I found last week\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear test and the events that followed depressingly familiar. They reminded me of Captain Renault\xe2\x80\x99s famous line from \xe2\x80\x9cCasablanca\xe2\x80\x9d just before he shuts down Rick\xe2\x80\x99s Caf\xc3\xa9: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!\xe2\x80\x9d The reactions to North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s 2006, 2009 and 2013 nuclear tests were the same \xe2\x80\x94 shock. Yet a decade has gone by and the North Korean nuclear threat has only grown.'b'I probably shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say this, but I take my hat off to the North Koreans. They have played their cards extremely well. Despite this episodic outrage, they have managed to become a full-fledged small nuclear power with a growing and increasingly sophisticated arsenal. Moreover, even as they have moved down the nuclear path, they have maintained fairly normal political, economic and other relations with many countries from China to Ethiopia. In effect, a large number of countries have tacitly accepted North Korea as a nuclear weapons state.'b'How has the North been able to do this? There are, of course, wonky answers: Unilateral and multilateral sanctions haven\xe2\x80\x99t been forceful enough, negotiators haven\xe2\x80\x99t been tough enough. But a big reason you will not often hear is that Americans and the international community have a comic book image of North Korea. We simply don\xe2\x80\x99t take them seriously.'b'Their people are robots, sporting lapel-pin pictures of their Dear Leader and regularly attending mass rallies where thousands move in unison like the Radio City Rockettes. Their official media \xe2\x80\x94 hyperbolic pronouncements, constant threats and worshipful praise of the leader \xe2\x80\x94 magnifies a cultlike image. And most of all, their leaders look strange to us \xe2\x80\x94 for example, Kim Jong-il with his funny hairdo and dark glasses. Senator Ted Cruz typified this perception of the North recently, 'b'labeling'b' the current leader, Kim Jong-un, as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy nutcase\xe2\x80\x9d with a nuclear bomb.'b'I have been meeting with North Korean government officials for more than two decades in their country, Europe and Asia, and I can tell you that they are neither nutcases nor comic book characters. They are a diverse group, from hidebound apparatchiks to bureaucrats who teach themselves English by listening to foreign radio broadcasts. Some of them, military men especially, are hard-line, patriotic and, above all, anti-American.'b'I found that out firsthand in the 1990s, while leading a team on an inspection of a military-run underground facility that we thought might violate the 1994 United States-North Korea denuclearization agreement. My team was locked in a room surrounded by soldiers with bayonets drawn after one member of our team violated the inspection procedures. Many of us thought we were going to be killed. Eventually, we managed to extricate ourselves, but as we left the base in an old school bus, the military men followed us in a truck with a loudspeaker blaring anti-American slogans. I asked our North Korean civilian escort if they were going to follow us for the whole ride back to our hotel \xe2\x80\x94 two hours over bumpy roads. He responded with a smile: \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want them to?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Americans might find it surprising that many North Korean officials take a nonideological view of foreign affairs. Indeed, we would call them realists. They are well aware of their national interests and are dedicated to safeguarding them, a dedication that is based on a keen understanding of the outside world. A case in point: At one meeting, I was sitting next to a well-connected North Korean official who wanted to talk about Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x9cIt Takes a Village.\xe2\x80\x9d (I was embarrassed to say I had not read it.) The North Koreans have demonstrated to me during many meetings that they are well versed in the particulars of political, economic and other developments in China, South Korea and Japan.'b'It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprising that North Koreans are realists. For decades, Americans thought Mao Zedong was an irrational, unstable dictator. But when the chips were down, he also turned out to be a serious realist by opening better relations with President Richard M. Nixon and Henry A. Kissinger after his relationship with Moscow deteriorated. In fact, I have been present several times when North Korean officials have met privately with Mr. Kissinger. They seemed to view those sessions as unprecedented opportunities to learn at the feet of an American statesman whom they deeply respect and admire.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t get me wrong. The North Koreans may know a lot about the outside world, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t know everything, even about the United States, their main adversary. In one meeting, an official asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do the president and secretary of state keep saying that the United States will not allow North Korea to have nuclear weapons when in fact you are not doing much to stop us?\xe2\x80\x9d He deduced that there must be a hidden agenda. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s because you want us to have nuclear weapons as an excuse to tighten your grip on South Korea and Japan, your two allies.\xe2\x80\x9d We responded that there was no hidden agenda and that the United States really did not want the North to have those weapons. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure we convinced him.'b'What does all of this mean for America\xe2\x80\x99s future policy toward North Korea? Immediate, strong responses to provocations are fine. So are public statements of indignation; bigger and better sanctions; more pressure on the North\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese allies to support these measures; military steps to show the North Koreans and our allies that we are resolute. These are all warranted. But the North Koreans are in this for the long haul. They feel that their country and its government\xe2\x80\x99s survival is at stake. Unless Americans take them seriously and formulate a long-term strategy for stopping this threat, rather than adopting ad hoc tactical responses, when North Korea conducts its fifth nuclear test a few years from now, the United States will find itself, like Captain Renault in \xe2\x80\x9cCasablanca,\xe2\x80\x9d rounding up the usual suspects.'b'AMERICANS work some of the longest hours in the Western world, and many struggle to achieve a healthy balance between work and life. As a result, there is an understandable tendency to assume that the problem we face is one of 'b'quantity'b': We simply do not have enough free time. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I could just get a few more hours off work each week,\xe2\x80\x9d you might think, \xe2\x80\x9cI would be happier.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This may be true. But the situation, I believe, is more complicated than that. As I discovered in a 'b'study'b' that I published with my colleague Chaeyoon Lim in the journal Sociological Science, it\xe2\x80\x99s not just that we have a shortage of free time; it\xe2\x80\x99s also that our free time, in order to be satisfying, often must align with that of our friends and loved ones. We face a problem, in other words, of 'b'coordination'b'. Work-life balance is not something that you can solve on your own.'b'Our study, which drew on data from more than 500,000 respondents to the Gallup Daily Poll, examined the day-to-day fluctuations and patterns in people\xe2\x80\x99s emotions, week after week. Two facts about emotional well-being emerged \xe2\x80\x94 one that was intuitive, the other surprising.'b'The intuitive finding was that people\xe2\x80\x99s feelings of well-being closely tracked the workweek. As measured by things such as anxiety, stress, laughter and enjoyment, our well-being is lowest Monday through Thursday. The workweek is a slog. Well-being edges up on Friday, and really peaks on Saturday and Sunday. We are, in a real sense, living for the weekend.'b'The surprising finding was that this is also true of unemployed people. We found that the jobless showed almost exactly the same day-to-day pattern in emotional well-being as working people did. Their positive emotions soared on the weekend, and dropped back down again on Monday.'b'It seems obvious why working people cherish the weekend: It\xe2\x80\x99s a respite from work. But why is the weekend also so important to the unemployed?'b'The key to answering this question is to recognize that not all time is equal. Time is, in many ways, what sociologists call a \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Network goods are things that derive their value from being widely shared. Take your computer: Its value depends in large measure on how many other people also have a computer. This is because you use your computer as, among other things, a communication technology: for Internet access, email, Facebook and file sharing. When everyone you know has a computer, the technology is indispensable. But if you were the only person with a computer, its value would be limited.'b'Free time is also a network good. The weekend derives much of its importance from the fact that so many people are off work together.'b'To help demonstrate this, my colleague and I conducted a second study, this time using the American Time Use Survey, which tracks how much time people spend doing various activities. We found that the weekly cycle in well-being from our previous study was mirrored in the pattern of time that people spent with family and friends \xe2\x80\x94 which was roughly double on weekends what it was during the week. According to our calculations, this increase of social time on the weekend accounted for roughly half the spike in weekend well-being.'b'Again, this was the same for the jobless. Monday to Friday offers five days when the unemployed are off work by themselves, searching job ads, doing household chores and so on. While the jobless have \xe2\x80\x9cfree time\xe2\x80\x9d during the week, their friends and family still have to go to work. The weekend is when the jobless fall back into sync with society.'b'The weekend, then, is not just a respite from work, but also gives similar relief from unemployment. It is a time when people can get what they\xe2\x80\x99ve been missing: time together.'b'This conclusion points to a key feature of the work-life problem: You cannot get more \xe2\x80\x9cweekend\xe2\x80\x9d simply by taking an extra day off work yourself. If we were to take more time off as individuals, we would be likely to spend that time, as the jobless do, waiting for other people to finish work. We are stuck \xe2\x80\x9cat work,\xe2\x80\x9d in a sense, by the work schedules of our family and friends.'b'Over the past few years, many workplaces have looked for ways to create more flexibility in individual work schedules. There is no question that doing so has many benefits. But my research suggests that a disadvantage of these efforts is that they may lead us even further from a weekend-like system of coordinated social time. They threaten, ultimately, to exacerbate the decline in civic engagement and social contact known as the \xe2\x80\x9cbowling alone\xe2\x80\x9d problem.'b'The solution might be found in a form of constraint: more standardization of the time for work and the time for life.'b'AS a lifelong devotee of fashion and tabloid magazines, I\xe2\x80\x99ve read dozens of \xe2\x80\x9cBeautiful/Sexy at Any Age\xe2\x80\x9d features. You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably seen these spreads, showcasing a bevy of lovely women whose faces, fashions, exercise routines and skin-care regimens are laid out to encourage imitation. For years, readers could stare at starlets and actresses and singers in their 20s, their 30s, their 40s and even edging bravely into their early 60s.'b'Then \xe2\x80\x94 nothing. While Vogue\xe2\x80\x99s most recent \xe2\x80\x9cAge\xe2\x80\x9d issue expanded its range to include a 'b'runner in her 90s,'b' and People\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWorld\xe2\x80\x99s Most Beautiful\xe2\x80\x9d made room for 75-year-old 'b'Jane Fonda in 2013'b', those are exceptions. It\xe2\x80\x99s as if, for the purposes of good looks and sexiness, older women simply cease to exist. Or maybe they turn 60 and go marching, \xe2\x80\x9cChildren of the Corn\xe2\x80\x9d style, into the racks at Nordstrom, never to be seen again.'b'On one hand, it\xe2\x80\x99s obvious discrimination. The 'b'Golden Globes'b' are Sunday night, and the red-carpet parade is likely to include the nominees Lily Tomlin and Maggie Smith, Helen Mirren and Ms. Fonda, proving that a woman can be stunning and stylish when she\xe2\x80\x99s 70, or beyond.'b'On the other hand, those magazines always gave me \xe2\x80\x94 and, I suspect, other female readers \xe2\x80\x94 a little hope. Reading into the absences, you could make out a finish line, a point at which you were no longer expected to perform what sometimes feels like a woman\xe2\x80\x99s major duty in life \xe2\x80\x94 looking good for men. You could bobby-pin the \xe2\x80\x9cbabe\xe2\x80\x9d tiara atop the next generation\xe2\x80\x99s head, throw away your Spanx and your food scale and enjoy your accomplishments, your grandchildren, your free time.'b'Sadly, recent events suggest that the finish line has moved \xe2\x80\x94 if it existed at all. Consider the fuss over 'b'Carrie Fisher'b', who reprised her role as Princess Leia Organa in \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\xe2\x80\x9d almost 40 years after her debut in the original \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars,\xe2\x80\x9d when she was 19.'b'In the decades since the first film, both the actress and her character have dealt with a lot \xe2\x80\x94 mental illness and addiction in Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s case, intergalactic warfare in Princess Leia\xe2\x80\x99s. One might assume, what with the Dark Side to contend with, that the princess-turned-strategist might have found herself too busy to attend Pilates class, or to hunt down coconut flour for paleo pancakes.'b'But the \xe2\x80\x9cForce Awakens\xe2\x80\x9d filmmakers determined that Leia should not only be smart and powerful, but she needed to be slender, too. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hire all of me \xe2\x80\x94 only about three-quarters!\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Ms. Fisher said'b'.'b'She ended up losing weight for the role. Still, some fans were displeased. Online discussions about Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s looks raged across social media. When the actress objected, 'b'tweeting'b' \xe2\x80\x9cplease stop debating about whether OR not I have aged well. Unfortunately it hurts all 3 of my feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d Kyle Smith, writing in The New York Post, 'b'swiftly put her in her place'b'. Ms. Fisher should be as grateful to the studio for making her drop the pounds as she\xe2\x80\x99d be if they\xe2\x80\x99d forced her to quit heroin or cigarettes, he wrote, lazily equating \xe2\x80\x9cthin\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9chealthy.\xe2\x80\x9d Never mind that many of the medications used to treat bipolar disorder can cause weight gain.'b'But the scorn didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop there. \xe2\x80\x9cIf she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want the public to talk about her, she could have spent the last 40 years teaching kindergarten,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Smith wrote of the actress, and the discussion of her appearance. Which makes me wonder whether he\xe2\x80\x99s ever visited a playground. Or eavesdropped during back-to-school night. The truth, as any woman can tell you, is that there\xe2\x80\x99s no place, no profession, nowhere that a woman\xe2\x80\x99s looks don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. Just go live a quiet, private life? Tell it to the women on the London Tube, who say, last month, they were handed cards by people claiming to be from a group called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Overweight Haters Ltd'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which read, in part, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s really not glandular, it\xe2\x80\x99s your gluttony \xe2\x80\xa6 you are a fat, ugly human.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If that isn\xe2\x80\x99t depressing enough, an unlikely voice has joined the fix-yourself-fatties chorus. 'b'Oprah Winfrey'b' is all over your TV, your phone, your Instagram feed, urging women to join her on yet another weight-loss journey with Weight Watchers. \xe2\x80\x9cInside every overweight woman is a woman she knows she can be,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Winfrey says in the minute-long ad for the company. \xe2\x80\x9cMany times you look in the mirror and you don\xe2\x80\x99t even recognize your own self because you got lost, buried, in the weight that you carry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Seriously? Oprah Winfrey, with all her influence, all her accomplishments, the school she\xe2\x80\x99s built and the money she\xe2\x80\x99s earned, is still feeling lost, buried, or like she\xe2\x80\x99s not her best and most authentic self? Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Oprah, of all people, be open to the possibility that she already is the woman she\xe2\x80\x99s meant to be? And when you\xe2\x80\x99re 61, are you really, still, expected to be fretting over whether you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your \xe2\x80\x9cbest body\xe2\x80\x9d? Can\xe2\x80\x99t you just page through your high school yearbook, eat the way your cardiologist says you should, and call it a day?'b'Maybe Oprah\xe2\x80\x99s find-that-woman-inside-shtick is unvarnished honesty, or maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s savvy salesmanship. In October, Ms. Winfrey became a part owner of Weight Watchers, investing $43.2 million to 'b'purchase'b' a 10 percent stake in the company. She joined its board of directors, enrolled in the program and has been trumpeting her 15-pound loss.

Plastic surgeons run ads for injectable fillers, body contouring and laser skin resurfacing to stave off the inevitable.'b'But what if, instead of investing in paid diets and microdermabrasion, we donated our dollars to worthy charities and gave our time to the food pantry or elementary school?

And lo, in November, the Finnish government 'b'proposed'b' paying every adult 800 euros or about $870 a month. Fits of this seemingly irrational generosity, called a universal basic income or U.B.I., are becoming surprisingly common. The Swiss will vote in a referendum on basic income this year. The Dutch city of Utrecht will soon 'b' start'b' a basic-income pilot program. Canada\xe2\x80\x99s ruling Liberal Party recently adopted a resolution calling for a similar experiment.'b'Still, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t happen here. Or could it? Over the past few years, a case for the U.B.I. has emerged that could make it appealing not just to the poor, who don\xe2\x80\x99t vote in great numbers, but to women, who do.'b'The feminist argument for a U.B.I. is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a way to reimburse mothers and other caregivers for the heavy lifting they now do free of charge. Roughly one-fifth of Americans have children 18 or under. Many also attend to ill or elderly relatives. They perform these labors out of love or a sense of duty, but still, at some point during the diaper-changing or bedpan cleaning, they have to wonder why their efforts aren\xe2\x80\x99t seen as \xe2\x80\x9cwork.\xe2\x80\x9d They may even ask why they have to pay for the privilege of doing it, by cutting back on their hours or quitting jobs to stay home.'b'Disproportionately, of course, these caregivers are women. Notwithstanding the advent of the stay-at-home dad, it\xe2\x80\x99s still mothers who do most of the invisible labor of cleaning, schlepping, scheduling and listening.'b'To the extent that mainstream feminism has paid attention to pocketbook issues over the past few decades, it has focused on the workplace: the wage gap, absence of family leave and weak \xe2\x80\x9cinfrastructure of care,\xe2\x80\x9d to use Anne-Marie Slaughter\xe2\x80\x99s phrase. These family-unfriendly facts of life on the job do yank success further out of the reach of women who combine career and children. But the problem is not that employers hate women and children. It\xe2\x80\x99s that they make a common assumption about motherhood: It\xe2\x80\x99s a lifestyle choice, not a wage-worthy job, and no one other than parents should pay for it. Wages for child rearing and housework? When one feminist collective took up that cry in the 1970s, it was more or less drummed out of the second-wave feminist movement, which aimed to get women into the work force, not pay them to stay out of it.'b'If mothers are glorified hobbyists who produce less value than nonmothers, it follows that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a free ride on everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s labor. This can lead to tensions between colleagues, and also colors relations between breadwinning husbands and stay-at-home wives, who notoriously have less bargaining power in their households.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d argue that this view of motherhood gets it exactly backward. Actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s society that\xe2\x80\x99s getting a free ride on women\xe2\x80\x99s unrewarded contributions to the perpetuation of the human race. As Marx might have said had he deemed women\xe2\x80\x99s work worth including in his labor theory of value (he didn\xe2\x80\x99t), \xe2\x80\x9creproductive labor\xe2\x80\x9d (as feminists call the creation and upkeep of families and homes) is the basis of the accumulation of human capital. I say it\xe2\x80\x99s time for something like reparations.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s an odd kind of reparations, you may object, that goes to fathers as well as mothers, the unattached as well as those with family responsibilities. But entertain this radical proposition: The universal basic income is a necessary condition for a just society, for it recognizes the fact that most of us \xe2\x80\x94 men, women, parents and nonparents \xe2\x80\x94 do a great deal of unpaid work to sustain the general well-being. If we\xe2\x80\x99re not raising children, then we may be going to school, or volunteering around the neighborhood.'b'Politically, the U.B.I. looks a lot more plausible than a subsidy aimed only at mothers, because, as Social Security and Medicare make clear, policies have more staying power when perceived as general entitlements rather than free cash for free riders. Critics on the right would dismiss a mothers\xe2\x80\x99 annuity as a handout to welfare queens. Critics on the left might see it as enshrining traditional gender norms. A universal basic income would sidestep both of these objections.'b'I do not want to create the impression that feminists dominate this debate. On the contrary: They\xe2\x80\x99re an overlooked part of a much larger conversation that has been going on for centuries.'b'In 1797, Thomas Paine declared that nations should give every 21-year-old a lump sum because those who inherit land have an unfair advantage over those who don\xe2\x80\x99t. By the middle of the last century, economists and leaders on both sides of the political spectrum were proposing minimum incomes.'b'The libertarian hero Friedrich A. Hayek supported \xe2\x80\x9ca sort of floor below which nobody need fall.\xe2\x80\x9d Milton Friedman called for a negative income tax in which, if you reported less than a certain amount, the Internal Revenue Service would pay you'b'. ('b'Our current earned-income tax credit resembles Friedman\xe2\x80\x99s plan, but only for people who, well, earn income. The negative income tax would have gone to the unemployed as well.) In 1969, President Richard Nixon proposed the Family Assistance Plan, a small annual stipend in lieu of welfare \xe2\x80\x94 $1,600 and some $800 in food stamps for a family of four. His bill was passed by the House of Representatives but died in the Senate Finance Committee.'b'Basic income proposals are sprouting up again, from the right as well as the left. 'b'Charles Murray'b' of the American Enterprise Institute thinks a guaranteed income could replace the welfare state. Libertarians want to get the government out of the private lives of the poor. Andy Stern, the former head of the Service Employees International Union, who has a book coming out soon on universal basic income, argues that it would offer the economic stability that the labor movement won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to provide as jobs disappear \xe2\x80\x94 though not, he says, if Social Security and Medicare are also cut.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see why basic income proposals are gaining steam right now. For one thing, the gap between rich and poor Americans is the 'b'widest on record'b'.'b'For another, smart machines and the \xe2\x80\x9cgig economy\xe2\x80\x9d seem poised to throw millions out of work. A 'b'2013 Oxford University study 'b' concluded that computers would replace humans in nearly half of all occupations in the United States within as little as two decades. We\xe2\x80\x99re not just talking about blue-collar jobs. Computers able to perform nonroutine cognitive tasks could wipe out middle-management positions such as accountant or transportation inspector, as well as many skilled service jobs, some of them typically associated with women. The Oxford study lists restaurant hostess and legal secretary, among others.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why some members of the Silicon Valley elite, better known for their contempt for government, advocate all-inclusive, no-strings-attached cash grants. In November, 'b'Robin Chase'b', the co-founder and former chief executive of Zipcar, called for a basic income. Venture capitalists like 'b'Albert Wenger'b' of Union Square Ventures and 'b'John Lilly of Greylock Partners'b', which invests in LinkedIn and Airbnb, have said that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to starting thinking about a U.B.I. The founder of 'b'HowStuffWorks.com'b', Marshall Brain, even wrote a basic-income novel called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Manna.'b'\xe2\x80\x9d It contrasts a nightmare world in which robots are managers and workers slaves with a utopian settlement in the Australian desert in which citizens receive a guaranteed share of the wealth created by such robots and devote themselves to dreaming up innovative new technologies. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Silicon Valley version of heaven.'b'THIS is all very nice, skeptics say, but the U.B.I. still represents a moral hazard. Give people money for nothing, and the lazy will grow lazier and the rest of us will be bankrupted.'b'But that does not appear to be the case. On the contrary: The U.B.I. gives workers less reason to loll about at home than do perversely disincentivizing policies like the one whereby a dollar earned is a dollar cut from a welfare check. Research suggests that, rather than weaken the will to work, unconditional regular disbursements let people manage their careers more wisely.'b'In five famous studies on the negative income tax conducted in the United States and Canada in the 1970s, a minimum income did bring down work hours a bit, partly because the unemployed took longer to find new jobs. Researchers speculate that they were holding out for positions that better matched their skills. In the United States, male breadwinners scaled back by as much as 9 percent a year. In Canada, they hardly cut back at all. In both countries, teenagers stayed in school longer. And women with children did spend up to 30 percent less time on the job.'b'The U.B.I. has feminist critics as well as supporters, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t like that finding. The U.B.I. would encourage women to drop out of the work force, they say, ceding the ground feminism has fought so hard for. But that concern strikes me as, well, paternalistic. Women should have more choices, not fewer. So should men. Equality between the sexes should not require everyone to conform to traditionally male patterns of employment.'b'Besides, basic income policies have been shown to mitigate specifically female kinds of poverty.'b'When cash-transfer experiments were conducted in poor towns in India, girls gained more weight and increased the time they spent at school at greater rates than boys, probably because when cash is scarce, the girls get less to eat and are kept home more.'b'In the United States, as Kathryn J. Edin and H. Luke Shaefer showed in their book on extreme poverty, \xe2\x80\x9c$2.00 a Day,\xe2\x80\x9d the process of qualifying for food stamps and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the welfare-to-work program created in 1996, can be so demanding, bewildering and degrading that many applicants simply give up. And who are the patient souls who wait in those daylong lines, pee into cups for drug tests or go home empty-handed? Women, more often than not, since there are more than four times as many families run by single mothers as by single fathers, and a third more households headed by women are on the dole than those run by men.'b'As for stay-at-home mothers supported by their partners, a basic income would let them put aside money of their own. Most retirement-savings instruments are linked to paychecks, which means that so-called nonworking parents have no way to pay into Social Security, 401(k)\xe2\x80\x99s or I.R.A.s. A basic income would let them save for old age. For nonwage-earning mothers trapped in abusive relationships, cash would make it easier for them to leave.'b'How much the basic income can accomplish depends on how it\xe2\x80\x99s configured. A truly universal guaranteed minimum income would be expensive. Say the U.B.I. was 'b'$12,000 a year per citizen over 18, and $4,000 per child'b'. At that rate, we\xe2\x80\x99d need about $3 trillion, roughly 80 percent of the total federal budget. The program would be even more effective, and more just, if children qualified for full stipends, since child rearing drives so many people \xe2\x80\x94 so many women! \xe2\x80\x94 into poverty. (It\xe2\x80\x99s unlikely that this would produce a baby boom, since even a handsome payout would hardly cover what children cost these days.)'b'The price tag for these cash transfers would be partly offset by savings. Most anti-poverty programs would become redundant. Bureaucracies tasked with weeding out cheaters would melt away (though, unfortunately, so would the jobs devoted to weeding). The better-off would pay back parts of their grants in taxes in proportion to their earned income. Moreover, a basic income would reduce the ill effects of poverty and therefore the cost to society of bad public health, crime and incarceration. Basic-income experiments have shown that recipients make greater use of medical services and break the law less often than nonrecipients. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s the boost to the economy that would result from poor people with cash in hand buying more goods.'b'Some of the many strategies proposed for raising the rest of the money include a relatively high flat tax; the closing of tax loopholes; a value-added tax; the elimination of middle-class entitlements such as the mortgage-interest deduction and retirement benefits; a careful paring back of Social Security; a tax on speculative financial transactions; and a carbon tax. We could also remit money reaped from the exploitation of public resources. Alaska, which already pays its citizens something very like a basic income, sends every adult and child a varying annual dividend of around $2,000 from a fund that invests royalties paid to the state by oil and natural gas producers.'b'The truth, though, is that the U.B.I. is \xe2\x80\x94 yes \xe2\x80\x94 a form of redistribution. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to afford it only when we decide it\xe2\x80\x99s worth affording. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just what we ought to decide. We should cut back on military spending if we have to, or raise taxes on the rich. The political will for such a huge restructuring of our economy would require a fundamental reassessment of the relationship between the state and the people. Maybe, like Thomas Paine, we\xe2\x80\x99d start to think of these wealth transfers as a right of citizenship instead of an insurance policy against financial disaster.'b'Even if we started small to get people used to the idea by offering way-below-poverty-level sums ($6,000, say), these would still buoy American families struggling not to slip underwater.'b'The U.B.I. would also edge us toward a more gender-equal world. The extra cash would make it easier for a dad to become the primary caregiver if he wanted to. A mom with a job could write checks for child care and keep her earnings, too. Stay-at-home parents would have money in the bank, more clout in the family, and the respect that comes from undertaking an enterprise with measurable value. And we\xe2\x80\x99d have established the principle that the work of love is not priceless at all, but worth paying for.'b'Donald J. Trump, reality television star and real estate mogul, is different in many ways from major political figures in our past. But there are striking similarities between Mr. Trump and George C. Wallace, the Deep South politician who ran for president each opportunity he got from 1964 through 1976. The connections between the two \xe2\x80\x94 their rhetoric and their ability to fire up crowds \xe2\x80\x94 give us a better sense of what Trumpism will mean once he is gone from the campaign stage. After all, political losers as well as winners can shape the future.'b'Mr. Trump started his business career with what he called a \xe2\x80\x9csmall loan\xe2\x80\x9d of a million dollars from his father. Mr. Wallace, the son of a struggling South Alabama farmer, clawed his way to power with hard work and a political antenna always ahead of the next public opinion poll.'b'And despite his reputation as a belligerent speechmaker, the insecure Mr. Wallace privately sought to ingratiate himself with friends and foes alike. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the egotistic Mr. Trump beginning a call to a hostile newspaper editor by cheerfully explaining, as Mr. Wallace once did, \xe2\x80\x9cI just called up to kiss your ass some more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What both share is the demagogue\xe2\x80\x99s instinctive ability to tap into the fear and anger that regularly erupts in American politics.'b'Mr. Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s 1963 inaugural address as governor of Alabama (\xe2\x80\x9cSegregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!\xe2\x80\x9d) and his \xe2\x80\x9cStand in the Schoolhouse Door\xe2\x80\x9d that same year seemed to limit his role to that of a strictly regional figure, part of Dixie\xe2\x80\x99s long tradition of racist politicians. His presidential candidacy in 1964 and surprising strength in Democratic primaries in Wisconsin, Indiana and Maryland did little to change that national image. In April 1967, when Mr. Wallace told a Syracuse, N.Y., audience that he had decided to run for president as a third-party candidate, the television networks ignored his announcement, as did most of the major newspapers'b'. 'b''b'But in 1968, against a backdrop of urban riots, a war in Vietnam that dragged on inconclusively, tumultuous antiwar demonstrations and the assassinations of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy, a fiery Mr. Wallace began to draw interest across the nation; by September the crowds at his rallies rivaled those for his two main opponents, Richard M. Nixon and Hubert H. Humphrey. Mindful of his reputation as a defender of segregation, the Alabama governor avoided explicitly racist language. He was a pioneer in the use of code words to attack African-Americans while seldom mentioning race, instead condemning \xe2\x80\x9casinine\xe2\x80\x9d school busing, the \xe2\x80\x9cbloc vote\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cthugs\xe2\x80\x9d from America\xe2\x80\x99s inner cities who supposedly stalked the nation\xe2\x80\x99s streets.'b'Uncertain of what to make of the political upstart, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s print media initially played down their coverage of Mr. Wallace rather \xe2\x80\x9clike parents who refuse to look when their child is doing something naughty for fear it might encourage him to show off,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of one British journalist.'b'As his poll numbers rose from single digits in the spring to more than 20 percent by the fall, it was no longer possible to ignore Mr. Wallace, and the major newsmagazines and largest newspapers attacked him with a barrage of thinly veiled invective: He was \xe2\x80\x9csimplistic\xe2\x80\x9d; he had not \xe2\x80\x9cone constructive proposal to offer a troubled nation\xe2\x80\x9d; he sought \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical profit in fear and hate.\xe2\x80\x9d Attacks by the mainstream media only strengthened his support. As one of Mr. Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s followers told a newspaper reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cI could care less what Time magazine thinks; I only use it once a day in the outhouse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The hypersensitive Mr. Trump obviously cares a lot more about Time\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. When the magazine failed to choose him as its 2015 Person of the Year, he 'b'complained that'b', despite being \xe2\x80\x9cthe big favorite,\xe2\x80\x9d Time had snubbed him in favor of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Angela Merkel, \xe2\x80\x9cwho is ruining Germany!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hostility to the civil rights movement was only a part of Mr. Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical repertoire. He was a \xe2\x80\x9cpopulist\xe2\x80\x9d of sorts, defending good, hard-working (white) Christian Americans, but his enemies were not the economic bankers and monopolists of his 19th-century forebears. He had found new dragons to slay.'b'On paper his speeches were stunningly disconnected, at times incoherent. But videotapes of those 1968 rallies captured a performance'b'.'b' A wild energy seemed to flow back and forth between Mr. Wallace and his audience as he called out their mutual enemies: bearded hippies, pornographers, sophisticated intellectuals who mocked God, traitorous anti-Vietnam War protesters, welfare bums, cowardly politicians and \xe2\x80\x9cpointy-head college professors who can\xe2\x80\x99t even park a bicycle straight.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For the television networks the spectacle became irresistible, particularly since rallies often erupted into violent chair-throwing confrontations between Mr. Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s supporters and angry demonstrators. Hunter S. Thompson understood that George Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s followers were not interested in position papers on banking regulations or the pros and cons of thermal energy. Watching the Alabama governor perform was awe-inspiring to the gonzo journalist, who likened the rallies to a Janis Joplin concert \xe2\x80\x9cin which the bastard had somehow levitated himself and was hovering over us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Both George Wallace and Donald Trump are part of a long national history of scapegoating minorities: from the Irish, Catholics, Asians, Eastern European immigrants and Jews to Muslims and Latino immigrants. During times of insecurity, a sizable minority of Americans has been drawn to forceful figures who confidently promise the destruction of all enemies, real and imagined, allowing Americans to return to a past that never existed.'b'At the same time, the rejection of the euphemisms of polite political rhetoric is part of the great appeal of such figures. As one of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters at a Dallas rally 'b'told a Slate reporter'b': \xe2\x80\x9cI love that he\xe2\x80\x99s talking in everybody else\xe2\x80\x99s language. He\xe2\x80\x99s not trying to be politically correct.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THAT response is simply an update from one of Mr. Wallace\xe2\x80\x99s 1968 followers: \xe2\x80\x9cGeorge doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give us some mealy-mouth \xe2\x80\x98on the one hand and on the other\xe2\x80\x99 spiel. He tells it like it is and if it offends some government bureaucrats and loudmouth civil rights agitators, so what? He\xe2\x80\x99s standing up and fighting for real Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'George Wallace was never going to be president; neither is Donald Trump. But their influence, even far from the White House, has an impact. The Alabama governor\xe2\x80\x99s success in mobilizing white working-class voters forced other candidates \xe2\x80\x94 particularly Nixon \xe2\x80\x94 to adapt a housebroken version of his rhetoric and policies. Mr. Wallace may have begun his career as a New Deal Democrat, but the way he appealed to these predominantly Democratic voters by channeling their frustrations against the federal government did much to pave the way for Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s more genial anti-government ideology.'b'It is more difficult to assess the long-term implications of a figure like Mr. Trump, whose \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies\xe2\x80\x9d seem even more incoherent than those of George Wallace. He, too, has learned how to exploit the deepest fears and hatreds of white Americans frightened about the present and despairing of the future.'b'Whether he is nominated by the Republican Party or simply disappears into the long line of discredited demagogues, he has already left his mark. Just listen to what some of his fellow Republican candidates are saying.'b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Privilege, pathology and power'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Jan. 2-3): Paul Krugman implicates all billionaires as smug, selfish, pathological and Republican.

That is the reason why I did what I did.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is a disturbing reminder of the influence of ISIS on individuals disposed to acts of terror, and how hard it is to identify all of them before they commit a violent act.'b'But the episode also highlighted something else that does not get enough discussion: the use of stolen guns in crimes.'b'You see, the gun used in the Philadelphia attack 'b'had been stolen'b', from a police officer no less, in 2013.'b'Our current discussion about increasing gun regulations often centers on efforts that would mostly affect people who legally buy firearms. Many of them make sense, in theory, but the truth is that they would not be likely to have a huge impact on criminal gun violence, because many of those criminals obtain their weapons illegally.'b'So, when the gun lobby and gun owners make this case, we must admit that they have a point.'b'In 2013, Samuel Bieler of the Urban Institute wrote a 'b'fascinating article'b' about where criminals get their guns, and his findings were somewhat shocking.'b'Corrupt dealers supply some of the guns. According to Bieler:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome researchers have suggested that gun retailers 'b'divert a relatively low volume of weapons'b', while others have found them to be a 'b'major source'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some come from gangs and family and friends. Specifically, \xe2\x80\x9cResearch has put their role as a supply source 'b'at 30'b' 'b'to 40 percent of crime guns'b', but little is known about the composition of this nebulous \xe2\x80\x98friends and family\xe2\x80\x99 category.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And research by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cjust one percent of licensed firearms dealers sold more than half of the guns recovered in crimes, and that most gun dealers rarely have one of their guns show up in crime.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But what I found most shocking was the number of guns that are stolen each year: as many as 'b'half a million'b'. Each year! And many of those stolen guns are then used in other crimes.'b'In a 2003 book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Challenge of Crime,\xe2\x80\x9d published by Harvard University Press, authors quoted researchers who found the following:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey learned that 32 percent of the felons had acquired their most recent weapon through their own theft; an additional 14 percent knew that their friend, family, or street source had stolen the weapon before conveying it; and an additional 24 percent thought that the weapon probably had been stolen by his source. At least 46 percent, then, and possibly as many as 70 percent of felons\xe2\x80\x99 most recently owned firearms had been stolen either by the offender himself or by the source from whom he acquired the weapon. In addition, 47 percent of the respondents quizzed as to whether they had ever stolen a firearm during a crime admitted to so doing and 86 percent of the felons who admitted prior stealing of firearms reported multiple thefts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rather than focusing on all guns, the vast, vast majority of which are owned by responsible people and are never used in the commission of a crime, we have to focus on keeping guns out of the hands of this relatively small number of criminals.'b'People, including the president in his speech and town hall meeting last week, like to compare increasing gun regulations to the way cars are regulated. But they didn\xe2\x80\x99t simply get safer due to regulations. They also got safer because the market desired more safety, as well as anti-theft features. Many of the innovations, carmakers came up with on their own. The gun market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t behave that way.'b'Furthermore, cars are required to be licensed, registered, insured and periodically inspected. Also, you can\xe2\x80\x99t hide a car the way you can hide a gun. Cars are operated on public roads.'b'If we want to truly put a dent in gun violence, we must take some incredibly unpopular steps in some pockets. Safety features \xe2\x80\x94 including smart guns that can only be fired by the owner \xe2\x80\x94 are going to have to be added to the market. That will be hard to sell because no one wants a gun to fail to because it lacks a charge or due to a technology glitch. One of benefits of traditional guns is that, technologically, they are simple and ancient. There are no batteries or chips.'b'We are also likely to have to register guns and require insurance. This would be almost impossible, given the gun lobby\xe2\x80\x99s and many gun owners\xe2\x80\x99 current stance and the paranoid fears of confiscation, a fear some liberals feed.'b'Making guns safer and keeping more of them out of the hands of criminals and in the hands of responsible owners can be done, but not as long as many responsible owners are also unreasonable ones.'b'Republican and Democratic governors in several states that have refused to expand their Medicaid programs are now seeking to do so, but will need approval from Republican-dominated legislatures. Even if they are not moved by humanitarian concerns to improve health care for their poorest citizens, recalcitrant legislators should at least see the folly of rejecting extremely generous matching funds. The federal government will pay 100 percent of the cost for newly eligible enrollees in 2016 and 95 percent in 2017, phasing down to 90 percent in 2020 and subsequent years.'b'Thus far 30 states and the District of Columbia 'b'have expanded'b' their Medicaid programs and 20 have not, although several of them are debating whether to do so. Some of the states that expanded were given federal waivers to use conservative approaches, like using Medicaid money to pay for private insurance. In several states that have not expanded or are still debating, pragmatic Republican governors find themselves at odds with ideologues in Congress and with right-wing groups that want to destroy Obamacare at all costs.'b'Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, now seeking the Republican nomination for president, was one of the first to see the wisdom of expanding Medicaid to bring in billions of dollars in federal matching funds. When Republicans who dominated the legislature balked, he bypassed them with a tactical maneuver that allowed a separate board to expand the state\xe2\x80\x99s Medicaid without legislative approval. He calls this the right thing to do, fiscally and morally, as it surely is. No governors should deny health coverage for people just because they are ideologically opposed to federal entitlement programs.'b'The Republican governors of South Dakota and Wyoming and the Democratic governor of Virginia have included Medicaid expansion in their state budgets, suggesting a strong desire to get their hands on federal matching funds if only they can wrest approval from their legislatures. Virginia appears a lost cause, but the other two states are up for grabs.'b'In Louisiana, term-limited Gov. Bobby Jindal blocked expansion last year, but was succeeded by a Democrat who vows to quickly enroll about 300,000 more people on top of the 1.4 million already enrolled. In 'b'Arkansas'b', where a centrist Democratic governor used federal money to buy private coverage for more than 200,000 people in 2013, his Republican successor wants to continue the expansion. In 'b'Kentucky'b', a new Republican governor who vowed to roll back the big expansion ordered by his Democratic predecessor is having second thoughts now that he is responsible for the health of his constituents.'b'Elsewhere the forces of reaction remain busily at work. In Utah, a Republican governor who had futilely tried to get expansion approved by the Legislature gave up this year and did not include expansion in his budget. Both Republican senators from Utah are opposed to expansion.'b'And in Florida, where the Legislature has blocked expansion, there is a campaign to amend the state Constitution to require the state to accept federal funds for expansion. It is considered a long shot whether the campaign can gather almost 700,000 signatures by Feb. 1 to put the measure on the ballot during the 2016 presidential campaign. It appears to be the last hope for hundreds of thousands of poor Floridians.'b'Do you remember the \xe2\x80\x9cBush boom\xe2\x80\x9d? Probably not. Anyway, the administration of George W. Bush began its tenure with a recession, followed by an extended \xe2\x80\x9cjobless recovery.\xe2\x80\x9d By the summer of 2003, however, the economy began adding jobs again. The pace of job creation wasn\xe2\x80\x99t anything special by historical standards, but conservatives insisted that the job gains after that trough represented a huge triumph, a vindication of the 'b'Bush tax cuts'b'.'b'So what should we say about the Obama job record? 'b'Private-sector employment'b' \xe2\x80\x94 the relevant number, as I\xe2\x80\x99ll explain in a minute \xe2\x80\x94 hit its low point in February 2010. Since then we\xe2\x80\x99ve gained 14 million jobs, a figure that startled even me, roughly double the number of jobs added during the supposed Bush boom before it turned into the Great Recession. If that was a boom, this expansion, capped by last month\xe2\x80\x99s really good report, outbooms it by a wide margin.'b'Does 'b'President Obama'b' deserve credit for these gains? No. In general, presidents and their policies matter much less for the economy\xe2\x80\x99s performance than most people imagine. Times of crisis are an exception, and the Obama stimulus plan enacted in 2009 made a big positive difference. But that stimulus 'b'faded out fast'b' after 2010, and has very little to do with the economy\xe2\x80\x99s current situation.'b'The point, however, is that politicians and pundits, especially on the right, constantly insist that presidential policies matter a lot. And Mr. Obama, in particular, has been attacked at every stage of his presidency for policies that his critics allege are \xe2\x80\x9cjob-killing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the former House speaker, John Boehner, once used the phrase 'b'seven times'b' in less than 14 minutes. So the fact that the Obama job record is as good as it is tells you something about the validity of those attacks.'b'What did Mr. Obama do that was supposed to kill jobs? Quite a lot, actually. He signed the 2010 'b'Dodd-Frank financial reform'b', which critics claimed would crush employment by starving businesses of capital. He 'b'raised taxes'b' on high incomes, especially at the very top, where average tax rates rose by about six and a half percentage points after 2012, a step that critics claimed would destroy incentives. And he enacted a health reform that went into full effect in 2014, amid claims that it would have catastrophic effects on employment.'b'Yet none of the dire predicted consequences of these policies have materialized. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just that overall job creation in the private sector \xe2\x80\x94 which was what Mr. Obama was supposedly killing \xe2\x80\x94 has been strong. More 'b'detailed examinations'b' of labor markets also show no evidence of predicted ill effects. For example, there\xe2\x80\x99s no evidence that Obamacare led to a shift from full-time to part-time work, and no evidence that the expansion of 'b'Medicaid'b' led to large reductions in labor supply.'b'So what do we learn from this impressive failure to fail? That the conservative economic orthodoxy dominating the Republican Party is very, very wrong.'b'In a way, that should have been obvious. For conservative orthodoxy has a curiously inconsistent view of the abilities and motivations of corporations and wealthy individuals \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, job creators.'b'On one side, this elite is presumed to be a bunch of economic superheroes, able to deliver universal prosperity by summoning the magic of the marketplace. On the other side, they\xe2\x80\x99re depicted as incredibly sensitive flowers who wilt in the face of adversity \xe2\x80\x94 raise their taxes a bit, subject them to a few regulations, or for that matter hurt their feelings in a speech or two, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll stop creating jobs and go sulk in their tents, or more likely their mansions.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a doctrine that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t make much sense, but it conveys a clear message that, whaddya know, turns out to be very convenient for the elite: namely, that injustice is a law of nature, that we\xe2\x80\x99d better not do anything to make our society less unequal or protect ordinary families from financial risks. Because if we do, the usual suspects insist, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be severely punished by the invisible hand, which will collapse the economy.'b'Economists could and did argue that history proves this doctrine wrong. After all, America achieved rapid, indeed unprecedented, income growth in the 1950s and 1960s, despite top tax rates beyond the wildest dreams of modern progressives. For that matter, there are countries like Denmark that combine high taxes and generous social programs with very good employment performance.'b'But for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know much about either history or the world outside America, the Obama economy offers a powerful lesson in the here and now. From a conservative point of view, Mr. Obama did everything wrong, afflicting the comfortable (slightly) and comforting the afflicted (a lot), and nothing bad happened. We can, it turns out, make our society better after all.'b'During a 'b'New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day speech'b', President Paul Kagame of Rwanda pretended to be humbled by the outcome of a 'b'constitutional referendum 'b'that paved the way for him to seek a third term and, conceivably, rule until 2034.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I do not think our aim is to have a president for life, nor is it what I would want,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kagame said. \xe2\x80\x9cSooner, rather than later, this office will be transferred from one person to another in a manner that will serve a purpose, not merely set an example, whether for ourselves or others.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those words ring hollow. Mr. Kagame seems intent on staying in power indefinitely. Since he took the reins of this small east African country after the Rwandan genocide in 1994, he has become increasingly authoritarian, cracking down on freedom of expression and making it impossible for political opponents to organize.'b'He is among the leaders President Obama had in mind during a trip to Africa last year,'b' when he proclaimed 'b'that \xe2\x80\x9cAfrica doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need strongmen.\xe2\x80\x9d Term limits have 'b'become a contentious issue o'b'n the continent in recent years. President Pierre Nkurunziza of Burundi'b' caused a crisis'b' last year by pressing for a third term. In Burkina Faso, 'b'a similar attempt 'b'by Blaise Compaor\xc3\xa9 in 2014 inspired protests that ultimately forced him to flee the country.'b'Rwanda\xe2\x80\x99s situation is unique. American officials were not terribly optimistic that Mr. Kagame would cede power this year, not least because he faces 'b'the prospect of being prosecuted for war crimes'b' at some point in the future. But they nonetheless have continued to criticize him for his authoritarian style.'b'Mr. Kagame\xe2\x80\x99s record is mixed, and some of his accomplishments have earned him praise in the international community. Under his watch, Rwanda, which was devastated by the bloodletting in 1994, has become one of the safest countries in the region and'b' its economy has grown 'b'steadily in recent years. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s gross domestic product has grown between 7 and 8 percent per year since 2003, significantly reducing he number of impoverished Rwandans.'b'But those gains have come as government critics have been unlawfully detained and forced into exile. Some have been killed in custody. In its most recent 'b'annual human rights report'b', the State Department last year noted an increase in \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically motivated abductions\xe2\x80\x9d in Rwanda and said that local human rights groups had stopped investigating such cases as a result of government pressure.'b'Mr. Kagame\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'international champions'b' include former President Bill Clinton, former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Like many international leaders, they have been heartened by the remarkable progress Rwanda has made since 1994. They should, however, acknowledge and speak out against the government\xe2\x80\x99s continuing abuses. To ignore them simply because they play out largely out of sight does nothing for the liberties of Rwanda\xe2\x80\x99s citizens or the health of its politics.'b'The United States should lift sanctions on Iran; no, it should impose new sanctions on Iran. The short answer is that the Obama administration should do both.'b'The sanctions imposed to press Iran to negotiate curbs on its nuclear program should be lifted as promised when the recent nuclear agreement goes into effect, maybe as early as next week. The Obama administration is wisely planning a separate set of new sanctions in response to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s two recent tests of ballistic missiles, which violated United Nations resolutions.'b'Critics of Iran and the nuclear deal say the missile tests are proof that the agreement failed. But ending Iran\xe2\x80\x99s production of ballistic missiles was not the focus of the agreement. The greater threat by far has always been Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program, which was coming closer to producing a bomb until the agreement halted the process.'b'That does not mean the missile tests in October and November should not be addressed. Iran is advancing the range and mobility of its ballistic missiles and vowing to accelerate production. Most worrisome is a collaboration with North Korea, which has nuclear weapons and provided Iran with many of its first missiles, and still supplies 'b'key components. 'b' A recent 'b'Congressional Research Service report 'b'called their cooperation \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and meaningful.\xe2\x80\x9d Iran has long rejected the United Nations Security Council\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to curb the ballistic program, saying it is vital for defense.'b'To his credit, President Hassan Rouhani is moving quickly to implement the nuclear deal. With a crucial election in February, he is desperate for the economic boost that is expected once sanctions are lifted. As required, Iran has already shipped its stockpile of enriched uranium to Russia. Once Iran meets the other demands of the deal, like disassembling more than 13,000 centrifuges, the major powers agreed they would give it access to $100 billion in frozen assets from oil sales and allow it to do business again with the world.'b'House Republicans, who opposed the nuclear deal, have begun a new effort to kill it by 'b'pushing a bill'b' to restrict the administration\xe2\x80\x99s ability to lift sanctions on Iranian banks. That would mean reneging on America\xe2\x80\x99s commitments, and President Obama would veto the bill.'b'In October, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said Iran would walk away from the nuclear deal if new sanctions of any kind were imposed. But the administration has been clear that even after the most onerous sanctions are lifted under the nuclear deal, it would enforce those pertaining to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s missile, terrorism and human rights activities. The nuclear deal 'b'lifts'b' United Nations ballistic missile sanctions on Iran within eight years, but American sanctions on firms that sell arms to Iran will remain.'b'The administration told Congress that missile-related sanctions were coming, 'b'then held back'b', infuriating many lawmakers. While the delay was not explained, this is a delicate moment, and it may make sense to wait because Iran is on the verge of implementing the nuclear deal. Also, an Iranian official 'b'told Reuters'b' last week that negotiations are again underway on the possible release of the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and other Americans held by Iran. Another complication is the recent worsening of the conflict between Shiite-majority Iran and Sunni-led Saudi Arabia.'b'New sanctions on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s ballistic missiles must still be pursued. The people and agencies most responsible for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s program were hit with sanctions years ago; the new measures would add 11 new individuals and entities to a long list. That should not be so onerous that Iran would walk away from the economic relief it stands to gain from the nuclear deal. And it is an important and necessary way of keeping pressure on Iran to cease its unacceptable activities.'b'Fairhope, Ala. \xe2\x80\x94 ON New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve my wife and I, Democrats in one of the most Republican states in the nation, attended a Cotton Bowl party near Mobile Bay. For a few hours, politics was forgotten as we cheered on the Alabama Crimson Tide to its 38-0 triumph over the Michigan State Spartans.'b'By New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Day, hung over from the Champagne fizz of believing we were one, we\xe2\x80\x99d retreated into election-year tribalism.

When I see the Obama/Biden 2008 sign propped in my garage, I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of the night it disappeared from our yard, turning up in a ditch.

When I returned South in 1996, after living for 20 years in New York City, the right emphatically outnumbered the left but, except at the extremes, there was a measure of respect. In the Clinton-Dole matchup that fall, a Clinton \xe2\x80\x9996 button provoked vigorous discussion across political lines. Clinton \xe2\x80\x9916 will generate vitriol.'b'After Alabama supported John F.

Not only are older women unable to find new jobs in a marketplace in which age discrimination laws are blatantly violated in hiring and firing, but women are more vulnerable to such treatment, and not merely because they took time off to raise children.'b'Because of gender discrimination, women are more likely to have been placed on mommy tracks or disadvantaged by a glass ceiling, and have less clout to wield during layoffs or restructurings. Without such power, women become easy targets when, for example, business falls off or a company merges; age discrimination makes it all the more likely that such women will lose their jobs and not find new ones.'b'Nor are such women accurately represented in the unemployment statistics, since many accept part-time work or, for lack of a better option, become self-employed. Yet the victims of the perfect storm of gender and age discrimination may have financial obligations equal to those of their male counterparts. A lost job can mean a lost home, a disabled child without adequate support or a spouse who is suddenly burdened with the full support of the family.'b'To remedy such inequities, age discrimination laws must be strengthened and enforced, and gender discrimination acknowledged as a continuing workplace concern.

All parties hoped, and continue to believe, that the resolution of the nuclear issue would enable us to focus on the serious challenge of extremism that is ravaging our region \xe2\x80\x94 and the world.'b'President Rouhani has repeatedly declared that Iran\xe2\x80\x99s top foreign policy priority is friendship with our neighbors, peace and stability in the region and global cooperation, especially in the fight against extremism. In September 2013, a month after taking office, he introduced an initiative called World Against Violence and Extremism (WAVE). It was approved by consensus by the United Nations General Assembly, giving hope for a farsighted global campaign against terrorism.'b'Unfortunately, some countries stand in the way of constructive engagement.'b'Following the signing of the interim nuclear deal in November 2013, 'b'Saudi Arabia'b' began devoting its resources to defeating the deal, driven by fear that its contrived Iranophobia was crumbling. Today, some in Riyadh not only continue to impede normalization but are determined to drag the entire region into confrontation.'b'Saudi Arabia seems to fear that the removal of the smoke screen of the nuclear issue will expose the real global threat: its active sponsorship of violent extremism. The barbarism is clear. At home, state executioners sever heads with swords, as in the recent execution of 47 prisoners in one day, including Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, a respected religious scholar who 'b'devoted'b' his life to promoting nonviolence and civil rights. Abroad, masked men sever heads with knives.'b'Let us not forget that the perpetrators of many acts of terror, from the horrors of Sept. 11 to the shooting in San Bernardino and other episodes of extremist carnage in between, as well as nearly all members of extremist groups like Al Qaeda and the Nusra Front, have been either Saudi nationals or brainwashed by petrodollar-financed demagogues who have promoted anti-Islamic messages of hatred and sectarianism for decades.'b'The Saudi strategy to derail the nuclear agreement and perpetuate \xe2\x80\x94 and even exacerbate \xe2\x80\x94 tension in the region has three components: pressuring the West; promoting regional instability through waging war in Yemen and sponsoring extremism; and directly provoking Iran. Riyadh\xe2\x80\x99s military campaign in Yemen and its support for extremists are well known. Provocations against Iran have not grabbed international headlines, primarily thanks to our prudent restraint.'b'The Iranian government at the highest level unequivocally condemned the assault against the Saudi embassy and consulate in Tehran on Jan. 2, and ensured the safety of Saudi diplomats. We took immediate measures to help restore order to the Saudi diplomatic compound and declared our determination to bring perpetrators to justice. We also took disciplinary action against those who failed to protect the embassy and have initiated an internal investigation to prevent any similar event.'b'By contrast, the Saudi government or its surrogates have over the past three years directly targeted Iranian diplomatic facilities in Yemen, Lebanon and Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 killing Iranian diplomats and locals. There have been other provocations, too. Iranian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia have endured systematic harassment \xe2\x80\x94 in one case, Saudi airport officers molested two Iranian boys in Jeddah, fueling public outrage. Also, Saudi negligence was to blame for the stampede during the recent hajj, which left 464 Iranian pilgrims dead. Moreover, for days, Saudi authorities refused to respond to requests from grieving families and the Iranian government to access and repatriate the bodies.'b'This is not to mention the routine practice of hate speech not only against Iran but against all Shiite Muslims by Saudi Arabia\xe2\x80\x99s government-appointed preachers. The outrageous beheading recently of Sheikh Nimr was immediately preceded by a sermon of hatred toward Shiites by a Grand Mosque preacher in Mecca, who last year 'b'said'b' that \xe2\x80\x9cour disagreement with Shiites will not be removed, nor our suicide to fight them\xe2\x80\x9d as long as Shiites remained on the earth.'b'Throughout these episodes, Iran, confident of its strength, has refused to retaliate or break \xe2\x80\x94 or even downgrade \xe2\x80\x94 diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia. We have until now responded with restraint; but unilateral prudence is not sustainable.'b'Iran has no desire to escalate tension in the region. We need unity to confront the threats posed by extremists. Ever since the first days after his election, the president and I have indicated publicly and privately our readiness to engage in dialogue, promote stability and combat destabilizing extremism. This has fallen on deaf ears in Saudi Arabia.'b'The Saudi leadership must now make a choice: They can continue supporting extremists and promoting sectarian hatred; or they can opt to play a constructive role in promoting regional stability. We hope that reason will prevail.'b'RIO DE JANEIRO \xe2\x80\x94 A S\xc3\xa3o Paulo judge sent shock waves across 'b'Brazil'b' last month with a ruling that required Brazilian telecommunications operators to block the use of the instant messaging platform WhatsApp for 48 hours. Less than 13 hours later, another S\xc3\xa3o Paulo judge reversed the decision, restoring service. But in the meantime, as many as 'b'100 million'b' Brazilians had been seriously inconvenienced, and civil libertarians around the world looked on with dismay.'b'Brazilians take their social media very seriously. The country has one of the fastest growing populations of Internet users in the world. Online tools like Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp are used not only to express opinions; they are an affordable alternative to exorbitantly priced Brazilian telecom providers. One recent study in Brazil found that WhatsApp was used by 93 percent of those surveyed who had Internet access.'b'The official reason for the judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision to suspend WhatsApp was because its parent company, Facebook, refused to comply with requests to provide personal information and communications records to prosecutors in an investigation into organized crime and drug trafficking. This is not the first time that the Brazilian authorities have jousted with tech companies. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the crimes being investigated, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s action was reckless and represents a potentially longer-term threat to the freedoms of Brazilians.'b'The ruling was not entirely out of the blue. Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s Congress has been considering legislation that would roll back key provisions of the country\xe2\x80\x99s freshly minted digital bill of rights, known as the Marco Civil da Internet, which was passed in 2014. The new proposal is expected to make it easier for prosecutors to access citizens\xe2\x80\x99 personal information without the nuisance of having to obtain a court order.'b'Described by critics as \xe2\x80\x9cthe big spy bill,\xe2\x80\x9d it would require Brazilians to register personal details like their home address, telephone number and other private information when accessing websites. It would also expose citizens to possible charges of libel for comments made on social media. At a time when political dissent is vigorous, this bill would surely chill debate.'b'A key architect of the spy bill is the president of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s lower house of Congress, Eduardo Cunha. Mr. Cunha was a leading opponent of the Marco Civil and teamed up with the Congress\xe2\x80\x99s evangelical caucus to take it down. Complicating matters, Mr. Cunha is under federal police investigation for corruption and taking bribes, charges he vehemently denies. That aside, groups like the 'b'Center for Technology and Society'b', a think tank based at the Funda\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o Getulio Vargas law school, argue that the proposed legislation is probably unconstitutional.'b'These latest efforts to reduce Brazilians\xe2\x80\x99 digital rights are in stark contrast to the country\xe2\x80\x99s former reputation as a champion of Internet freedom. In the wake of scandals over the United States\xe2\x80\x99 National Security Agency\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'collection'b' of Brazilian citizens\xe2\x80\x99 communications and 'b'phone-tapping'b' of top government officials in 2013, Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s president, Dilma Rousseff, projected the digital freedom agenda onto the global stage \xe2\x80\x94 even 'b'raising'b' the issue at the United Nations.'b'When Brazilian legislators passed the Marco Civil, the government signaled to its citizens and the international community that it took \xe2\x80\x9c'b'net neutrality'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and digital sovereignty seriously. It was, in effect, declaring that the democratic principles of freedom, privacy and human rights were equally applicable in cyberspace as in the physical world.'b'That ethos continued in 2014, when Brazil hosted the 'b'NETmundial'b', an Internet governance conference. And just a few months ago, Brazil played host to the 'b'Internet Governance Forum'b', showcasing its \xe2\x80\x9cmulti-stakeholder approach\xe2\x80\x9d as a model for other countries.'b'Although WhatsApp was soon back online, the damage was done. Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s aspirations to Internet freedom have come into clear conflict with the authorities\xe2\x80\x99 plans to expand the digital surveillance state. And while Brazil boasts on the global stage of its open Internet, it is progressively 'b'militarizing'b' its cybersecurity and defense infrastructure.'b'Consider the response of the authorities to the huge street protests of 2013: The Brazilian Intelligence Agency and the Army\xe2\x80\x99s cybersecurity command actively 'b'monitored'b' civilian protesters and politicians. And the government now regularly clashes with tech companies like 'b'Apple'b' and 'b'Google'b' over access to users\xe2\x80\x99 personal data. Every government deals with similar tensions, but each must strive to strike a balance between protecting civil liberties on one hand, and the possible overreach of a country\xe2\x80\x99s security apparatus on the other.'b'Having emerged from authoritarian rule just 'b'30 years ago'b', Brazilians are especially sensitive to encroachments on their basic freedoms, including digital ones. People still remember, for example, how 'b'habeas corpus'b' was suspended in the wake of the 1964 military coup. Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s politicians and judges should be more conscious than most of the slippery slope of curbing fundamental rights.'b'Last month\xe2\x80\x99s judicial injunction, together with retrograde proposals like the spy bill, set a dangerous precedent. For a while, the country looked to be a progressive voice for digital freedom. No one expected Brazil to become a leader in cyber surveillance and censorship.'b''b' 'b''b'After haunting pictures and stories of starving civilians showed up on international news sites and social media, food and other desperately needed aid were finally allowed into the Syrian town of 'b'Madaya on Monday'b'. Yet this should not be a cause for celebration or complacency. The aid convoys and their supplies offer only a respite in the slow-motion agony that is destroying Syria and its people.'b'What is needed, and has long been needed, is an immediate end to the civil war. The obstacles are daunting. But the news coverage, especially the photos of emaciated Madaya residents, is putting a renewed focus on the failure of the major powers to at least move the conflict toward a cease-fire. It also gives fresh urgency to United Nations-sponsored peace talks later this month.'b'The disaster has been unfolding since 2011 when Syrians rose up in peaceful protest against President Bashar al-Assad. He responded with barrel bombs and chemical weapons, and now some 250,000 people are dead, and 'b'11 million displaced, including four million 'b' who have fled Syria to neighboring countries or Europe. The chaos enabled the Islamic State to move in and seize territory, making the conflict even worse.'b'Although Madaya is only an hour\xe2\x80\x99s drive from downtown Damascus, residents and international aid workers say much of the 'b'town is starving'b'. That is because the town is controlled by anti-Assad rebels and has been encircled by pro-government forces, including Iranian-backed Hezbollah units, with barbed wire, land mines and snipers. Trapped without aid for nearly 'b'three months'b', some 42,000 residents have been forced to make soups of grass and leaves, according to news reports.'b'The 'b'United Nations refugee agency'b' says it received \xe2\x80\x9ccredible reports\xe2\x80\x9d of people dying from malnutrition, though the total number is unclear. Medics for Doctors Without Borders say at least 28 people, including six babies, died at their clinic in Madaya. Other reports suggest dozens have died from starvation or lack of medical care.'b'The United Nations has said that in all, 4.5 million Syrians live in hard-to-reach areas, including 400,000 in 15 besieged towns like Madaya that are denied access to food and medicine. That means the number of people at risk has nearly doubled since the United Nations Security Council ordered the warring parties to allow aid deliveries in 2014. The Islamic State has trapped 200,000 Syrians in Deir al-Zour, and other insurgents have corralled more than 12,000 people in the pro-Assad towns of Foua and Kfarya in Idlib province.'b'The aid got through on Monday as part of an agreement between the warring sides and included supplying Foua and Kfarya as well as Madaya, where the starving awaited the first deliveries of rice, lentils and oil. That cannot be the end of it. Using food as a weapon violates international law, and the United States, Europe, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which all have influence with different proxy groups in Syria, have a responsibility to ensure that civilians have unconditional access to basic supplies.'b'Much of what these powers are doing in Syria, including American and Russian airstrikes, has complicated the relief effort. If negotiations on Jan. 25 to achieve a broad political settlement continue to falter, the outside powers should declare a cease-fire and find a way to impose it on their Syrian proxies.'b'IF the questions that came up during oral argument in Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association on Monday are any guide, the ruling bloc of conservative justices 'b'appears ready'b' to render a decision later this year that would significantly weaken public sector labor unions.'b'By stripping these unions of key financial resources \xe2\x80\x94 their fair share of fees provided by nonmembers \xe2\x80\x94 the court would upend a longstanding precedent. A decision in favor of the plaintiff would effectively slam the door on an era in which some conservatives joined liberals in recognizing that vibrant unions help make our democracy work. This is radicalism, not conservatism.'b'Public sector unions \xe2\x80\x94 representing teachers, firefighters and the like \xe2\x80\x94 are the remaining bright spot in America\xe2\x80\x99s once-thriving trade union movement. In the case before the 'b'Supreme Court'b', Rebecca Friedrichs, a dissident teacher in Southern California, argues that she should be able to accept the higher wages and benefits the union negotiates, but not help pay for the costs.'b'Relying on the First Amendment, Ms. Friedrichs says that she shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be forced by the government to support political causes with which she disagrees. But almost four decades ago, the Supreme Court came to a sensible compromise on this issue, written by an Eisenhower appointee, Justice Potter Stewart: No public sector worker can be compelled to join a union or to pay for its political efforts. However, the state may require that every worker pay fair share fees to support the costs of collective bargaining over bread-and-butter issues like wages, benefits and working conditions.'b'That 1977 ruling appears in real danger of being overturned. Doing so, David C. Frederick, a lawyer representing the union, told the court, \xe2\x80\x9cwould substantially disrupt established First Amendment doctrine and labor management systems in nearly half the country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. suggested that losing fair share fees would not pose much of a problem; if workers really support collective bargaining, the so-called free rider problem someone like Ms. Friedrichs represents would be \xe2\x80\x9creally insignificant.\xe2\x80\x9d But humans enjoy getting benefits for nothing. In states that recognize a duty to bargain but prohibit fair share fees, 'b'34 percent of teachers are free riders'b'.'b'Because today\xe2\x80\x99s conservatives are typically hostile to unions, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget that they were not always opposed to unionism or fair share fees. If conservatism is supposed to stand for anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s the idea that there is no such thing as a free lunch. In a 1991 case, Justice Antonin Scalia backed fair share fees, citing the legal duty unions have to represent the interests of nonmembers as well as members. Unless dissidents like Ms. Friedrichs want to return the raises, health care and retirement benefits that unions negotiate, conservative values suggest that they should contribute like everyone else.'b'During the Cold War, Republicans as well as Democrats fought for union endorsements and recognized that unions were critical civic organizations because they serve as a check on arbitrary government power; help sustain a middle-class society necessary for a stable democracy; serve to acculturate workers to democratic norms; and, in the case of teachers unions, support a public school system that helps children become thoughtful and reflective citizens.'b'Conservatives are fond of citing Alexis de Tocqueville, who was famously struck by the thriving civic associations that keep American democracy vitalized; for the past century, unions have been a critical part of that framework. In 1980, Ronald Reagan, then the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidate, championed the role of Polish unions in challenging dictatorial rule by the Communist Party. In a Labor Day speech that year, Reagan declared, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere free unions and collective bargaining are forbidden, freedom is lost.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Democracies are also more likely to thrive when a vibrant middle class can support them, an insight that goes all the way back to Aristotle. Large inequalities of wealth can create political inequality, and vice versa. Theodore Roosevelt warned of the dangers of having \xe2\x80\x9ca small class of enormously wealthy and economically powerful men, whose chief object is to hold and increase their power.\xe2\x80\x9d Strong unions ameliorate extreme inequalities.'b'Unions serve as what Robert Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard, calls \xe2\x80\x9cschools for democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d Being involved in workplace decisions and the give and take of collective bargaining, voting on union contracts and voting for union leadership are all important drivers of \xe2\x80\x9cdemocratic acculturation.\xe2\x80\x9d Union members also staff phone banks and canvass voters door to door, which actually increases civic participation among union members and nonmembers alike.'b'Teachers unions are strong champions of American public schooling, which undergirds our democracy. The 19th-century educator Horace Mann, who advocated fiercely for the common school system that became America\xe2\x80\x99s experiment with public education, made this point metaphorically: \xe2\x80\x9cA republican form of government, without intelligence in the people, must be, on a vast scale, what a mad-house, without superintendent or keepers, would be on a small one.\xe2\x80\x9d While some critics claim teachers unions have a detrimental effect on academic achievement, careful studies actually find higher achievement in states with strong teachers unions.'b'With the Supreme Court split, unions cling to a thin hope that one of the conservative justices will resist partisan pressure to tilt the political playing field against Democrats. I hope they\xe2\x80\x99re right. Unions aren\xe2\x80\x99t faultless, but they are a crucial source of stability and strength for our democracy.'b'Durham, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 THE release last month of \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a Murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d a 10-part documentary from Netflix, capped a year in which popular culture\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of the criminal justice system seems to have shifted. Out with the old tropes about truth-seeking investigators and tidy resolutions; in with the disquieting, dysfunctional reality of many courtrooms and police stations.'b'The documentary, which has captivated viewers and critics, chronicles the trials of Steven Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey for the 2005 killing of Teresa Halbach. Its depiction of alleged police corruption and prosecutorial bias has inspired some viewers to quip that they hope they are never arrested in Manitowoc, Wis., the county where the two men were convicted. But what happened to them happens to low-status criminal defendants across the country all the time.'b'Searing images of law enforcement abuses in Chicago, Cleveland and elsewhere have eroded the public\xe2\x80\x99s trust in police power on the street. At the same time, serialized true-crime programs, such as \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a Murderer\xe2\x80\x9d and the first season of the podcast \xe2\x80\x9cSerial,\xe2\x80\x9d are bringing the failures of due process into focus: careless police work, flawed forensics, forceful interrogations, unreliable witnesses and the woeful condition of state-funded criminal defense.'b'It takes hours rather than seconds to appreciate this procedural violence. That hasn\xe2\x80\x99t stopped listeners and viewers. \xe2\x80\x9cSerial\xe2\x80\x9d was downloaded some 75 million times. (Netflix doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release any audience statistics, but \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a Murderer\xe2\x80\x9d has generated widespread discussion in social and traditional media.) Yet after the shows are over, audiences still hunger for narrative resolution. Reddit users have written thousands of posts about \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a Murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d weighing evidence and acting as armchair detectives trying to find the \xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d perpetrator. Petitions seeking pardons for Mr. Avery and Mr. Dassey have gathered 380,000 signatures. A spinoff from the \xe2\x80\x9cSerial\xe2\x80\x9d podcast, sponsored by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers, updates listeners on appellate claims and advocates for a retrial.'b'Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t Americans want a satisfying finale? Our culture is steeped in procedural crime dramas. Hundreds of \xe2\x80\x9cLaw and Order\xe2\x80\x9d episodes concluded with definitive guilty verdicts, punctuated by a signature sound effect. CBS\xe2\x80\x99s hit show \xe2\x80\x9cCSI: Crime Scene Investigation\xe2\x80\x9d suggested that instant forensics always yielded definitive results.'b'The desire for closure is understandable, but a tidy conclusion is rarely attainable, and all of the Internet sleuthing and speculating can be distracting. Yes, post-conviction DNA testing and the work of Innocence Projects around the country have exonerated 'b'more than 1,700'b' defendants. Those cases heighten awareness of potential errors and demonstrate that wrongful convictions happen. But Americans shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect certainty about innocence. Sometimes the focus on finding new evidence to exonerate distracts from the question of whether or not the old evidence proved guilt.'b'Mr. Avery, the focus of \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a Murderer,\xe2\x80\x9d had a 1985 sexual assault conviction overturned after forensic proof of his innocence emerged. In the closing line of the documentary, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cThe truth always comes out sooner or later.\xe2\x80\x9d That line feels unfortunately misplaced. We may never know the facts behind the gruesome murder of which Mr. Avery was accused. Nor did \xe2\x80\x9cSerial\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csolve\xe2\x80\x9d the 1999 murder case it exhaustively explored.'b'The lack of resolution may be as valuable a lesson as the evidence of law enforcement misconduct. When I was a federal prosecutor, I had the luxury of working only on carefully screened cases with strong evidence. But fewer than 70,000 federal felonies are prosecuted each year, while roughly 2.5 million felonies proceed through the state courts. Many state cases involve near-simultaneous investigation and prosecution. One rarely finds out \xe2\x80\x9cwhat really happened.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The prosecutor in Mr. Avery\xe2\x80\x99s trial argued in his closing statement that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable doubts are for innocent people.\xe2\x80\x9d They are not. And procedural protections like access to defense counsel and freedom from coerced interrogations extend to both the innocent and the guilty. The real contribution of these documentaries is not to ask \xe2\x80\x9cwhodunit\xe2\x80\x9d but to reveal what was done to the defendants.'b'As listeners and viewers consume these stories, they are reminded of the humanity of the individuals involved \xe2\x80\x94 and they learn to see the defendants as more than abstractions. That knowledge should lead people to understand that resolution and justice are not the same thing. And whether or not the truth of these crimes ever comes out, shows, podcasts and narrative articles can make the public aware of distortions that occur in the legal process.'b'The United States\xe2\x80\x99 criminal justice system needs fewer guilt-assuming interrogation tactics, more disclosure of potentially exculpatory information to the defense, expanded oversight units within prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 offices to investigate potential miscarriages of justice, and fuller appellate scrutiny of convictions.'b'The moment is ripe for reform, culturally and politically. There is even some bipartisan support for legislation to reduce some federal criminal sentences and address the problem of mass incarceration. But unless our empathy generates demand for greater procedural integrity, only the narrative will change while the system stays the same.'b'IN the aftermath of terrorist 'b'attacks in Paris'b' and San Bernardino, Calif., American support for accepting more Syrian refugees has withered. The Republican presidential hopeful Donald J. Trump has called for blocking all Muslims from entering the United States, saying we are at war with radical Islam. Other politicians, including some governors and members of Congress, now specifically label Syrian refugees a threat.'b'The focus on whether or not to admit these desperate people to the United States obscures the bigger question of the refugee crisis. A vast majority of the more than four million refugees want to return to 'b'Syria'b' once the war there ends. For that reason, most have stayed in the region, often languishing for years in camps in Lebanon and Jordan, rather than migrating to Europe or attempting to enter the United States. According to estimates from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, there are some 634,000 refugees still in Jordan, 1.1 million in Lebanon and 2.3 million in Turkey.'b'These people are the responsibility of the international community, according to the 1951 Refugee Convention. The United States and all other signatories to the convention have a legal obligation to protect refugees and their well-being, which can mean resettlement when necessary.'b'I have met and talked with refugees in camps in Jordan and roadside tent settlements in Lebanon and those arriving on rubber boats in Greece. They are the furthest things from radical Islamic jihadists. They fled their villages after nearly five years of war in a final act of desperation. The shelling was incessant, as was the fighting. They were squeezed on all sides \xe2\x80\x94 by the Islamic State, by the forces of President Bashar al-Assad and by other rebels. They feared conscription and kidnapping. Many are professionals, including lawyers, dentists and engineers. Yet they had no work and couldn\xe2\x80\x99t feed their families. These are not terrorists; they are victims of terrorism.'b'But they face increasing burdens. Neither Jordan nor Lebanon allows them to work. Lebanon requires onerous re-registration fees every six months. The funds for refugee support, which the international community is supposed to provide, have fallen woefully short. As a consequence, the United Nations\xe2\x80\x99 World Food Program has had to cut food rations for Syrian refugees in Lebanon in half, down to $13.50 per person per month. How can anyone survive on less than 50 cents a day for food?'b'That is a reason so many have left the camps for the often dangerous trip to Europe. On the island of Lesbos they arrived on crowded rubber boats from Turkey, stumbled up the rocky shore, kissed the ground, tore off their life jackets and hugged one another with tears streaming down their faces. Under pressure from the European Union, Turkey has announced plans to give some refugees work permits in order to help stem the tide of migrants leaving. But Turkey is already supporting the greatest number of refugees, and its own unemployment rate is high.'b'Quite simply, the world has helped foster the migrant crisis by not supporting refugees in the Middle East. The United States prides itself on how much we have given to the refugee crisis, but we lag behind the European Union. On a per-capita basis, we are far outranked by many much smaller countries, among them Britain, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. Full funding of the United Nations appeals would go some way toward stemming the flow of refugees. The United States alone could give at least $500 million more to the United Nations Appeal annually.'b'But even with full funding, some refugees need to be resettled. Though the United States may prefer to pretend that this crisis is Europe\xe2\x80\x99s problem alone, it is not. United States policy in the region bears at least some responsibility for the tragic chaos in the Levant and the resulting rise of the Islamic State.'b'Acceptance of more refugees needs to be the second step in our efforts to stem the crisis. Certainly a situation where the United States takes few, while Europe becomes overburdened, feeds friction among allies at a time when solidarity in the West is critical. Furthermore it gives sustenance to Europe\xe2\x80\x99s anti-immigrant right-wing parties.'b'In December 2014 the United Nations 'b'identified'b' 130,000 vulnerable Syrian refugees in immediate need of resettlement. We could easily welcome half of those. Since 2011, we have taken in only about 2,000.'b'At this time, when heightened anxiety about terrorism has become intertwined with the plight of millions of refugees, there must be those among us \xe2\x80\x94 leaders and ordinary citizens \xe2\x80\x94 who are clearheaded enough to act. Indeed, the cost of not doing so is far too high.'b'An article in 'b'The Times Magazine'b' on Sunday has laid bare the unconscionable decades-long efforts of the DuPont company to hide the dangers of an obscure chemical and bamboozle regulators into allowing toxic pollution to continue long after the dangers were known to the company. The article by Nathaniel Rich described how a corporate lawyer, Rob Bilott, built a devastating case against DuPont, based on the company\xe2\x80\x99s own studies and internal documents. The case illustrates the urgent need for Congress to complete its efforts to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act, which has allowed tens of thousands of untested chemicals to remain on the market with little more than the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s say-so that they are safe.'b'The chemical that DuPont was protecting is known as PFOA, or perfluorooctanoic acid. It is used in the production of Teflon for non-stick frying pans, a huge source of profits for DuPont. When the Toxic Substances Control Act was enacted in 1976, PFOA was one of a multitude of untested chemicals allowed to remain on the market. The act also made it extremely difficult for the Environmental Protection Agency to require safety tests or crack down on chemicals known to be hazardous. Only a handful have been restricted over the past 40 years.'b'In the case of PFOA, DuPont brazenly dumped its toxic waste into a creek that ran through a pasture where farmers grazed and watered their cows, causing grotesque malformations and deaths among the animals. Meanwhile, the company hid evidence that the chemical had contaminated the local water supply well beyond what the company\xe2\x80\x99s own scientists considered safe and far beyond what independent scientists considered safe.'b'The Senate and the House have passed bills that would go a long way toward preventing such tragedies. What remains is for the two chambers to 'b'reconcile their versions'b' into one bill that can be sent to the president for his signature. The Senate bill is the stronger of the two. Both would make it harder for companies to hide information from the public and from federal or state agencies by claiming it is confidential business information. Both bills would require companies to justify claims of confidentiality, but the stronger Senate bill would also require the E.P.A. to review such claims. The Senate bill would also require full public disclosure of any chemical that was found to be hazardous in testing.'b'The Senate bill would eliminate a \xe2\x80\x9cCatch-22\xe2\x80\x9d provision in existing law that says the E.P.A. can\xe2\x80\x99t require safety testing unless it has evidence, which companies often try to hide, that a chemical may present an unreasonable risk. That is virtually impossible to demonstrate without the data that required testing would provide.'b'For regulatory purposes, the existing law divides chemicals into two groups \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cexisting chemicals,\xe2\x80\x9d more than 60,000, that were on the market when the first Toxic Substances Control Act was established in 1979, and \xe2\x80\x9cnew chemicals,\xe2\x80\x9d more than 20,000, that entered commerce after 1979.'b'Although the law theoretically gave the E.P.A. authority to review \xe2\x80\x9cnew chemicals\xe2\x80\x9d before they entered the market, it allowed companies to sell an untested chemical within 90 days if the overburdened agency didn\xe2\x80\x99t challenge them, as was usually the case. The Senate bill, but not the House version, would mandate that the E.P.A. find the chemical safe before it can be marketed.'b'The current law has no requirements for the E.P.A. to review the safety of existing chemicals. The Senate bill would require it to prioritize all chemicals in active commerce and set deadlines for their review. The House bill would largely leave the status quo untouched.'b'Both bills would allow industry to nominate chemicals for priority review, but the House bill would require the E.P.A. to evaluate any chemical a manufacturer submits, potentially eating up all of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s time and effort, whereas the Senate bill caps industry requests and gives the E.P.A. greater power to set its own priorities.'b'There is strong bipartisan support in Congress to reform the existing law. The frightening DuPont saga is further reason for Congress to choose the strongest possible reform.'b'In Donald J. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first television ad of the 2016 campaign, released last week, a photo of Hillary Clinton and President Obama flashes across the screen, followed by stark black-and-white images of the San Bernardino, Calif., attackers, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe politicians can pretend it\xe2\x80\x99s something else,\xe2\x80\x9d the ad\xe2\x80\x99s narrator says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Donald Trump calls it radical Islamic terrorism. That\xe2\x80\x99s why he\xe2\x80\x99s calling for a temporary shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until we can figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s going on.\xe2\x80\x9d The ad also promises that Mr. Trump will stop illegal immigration by \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In another ad released last week, Senator Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s campaign showed a swarm of insurance-commercial-ready actors rushing across a border, their sensible heels getting caught in the sand on their way to stealing American jobs. It was a deft political move on the Cruz campaign\xe2\x80\x99s part \xe2\x80\x94 the ad implied the threat of Mexican immigrants without having to show them at all.'b'The politics of immigration \xe2\x80\x9cwould be very, very different if a bunch of lawyers or bankers were crossing the Rio Grande, or if a bunch of people with journalism degrees were coming over and driving down the wages in the press,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cruz says in a voice-over. \xe2\x80\x9cThen we would see stories about the economic calamity that is befalling our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the 2016 campaign, one thing candidates haven\xe2\x80\x99t been afraid of is embracing fear, especially the fears they can stir up by exaggerating a threat posed by Muslims or by immigrants from Latin America. The intended audience for these ads \xe2\x80\x94 white people primed for such tactics \xe2\x80\x94 is taken for granted.'b'The ads are in many ways the direct descendants of a political advertisement from 1988 about a man named William Horton, who came to be known as \xe2\x80\x9cWillie.\xe2\x80\x9d While that ad didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up deciding the election, it set the standard for race-baiting political ads for cycles to come.'b'Some background: In June 1986, while serving time in Massachusetts for the murder of a 17-year-old gas station attendant, Mr. Horton left prison on weekend furlough and never returned. Nine months later, he was tracked down by the police and convicted of stabbing a man and raping the man\xe2\x80\x99s fianc\xc3\xa9e at gunpoint.'b'The ad that invoked this story, titled \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Weekend Passes'b',\xe2\x80\x9d aired on a handful of news networks by a political action committee supporting George H. W. Bush for president in 1988. It was meant to imply that Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s opponent, Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, was soft on crime.'b'Now, Mr. Dukakis readily admits he messed up by failing to defend himself against the ad. He says that not responding to the ad turned out to be \xe2\x80\x9cone of the dumbest decisions politically\xe2\x80\x9d that he ever made.'b'He said last week that he thought the ad was \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly racist,\xe2\x80\x9d but feared that a counterattack would fan the flames.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody takes a shot at you, you really don\xe2\x80\x99t want to dignify it by taking the guy on and making it even bigger than it was in the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The story of Mr. Horton\xe2\x80\x99s escape was already national news before the ad aired. On the floor of the House, Representative Newt Gingrich 'b'read news articles'b' that criticized the Massachusetts furlough program, and by extension, Mr. Dukakis. Then, Al Gore indirectly brought up furloughs at a Democratic primary debate with Mr. Dukakis.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you were elected president, would you advocate a similar program for federal penitentiaries?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gore 'b'asked him'b'.'b'From there, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t hard for consultant Lee Atwater, a seasoned Republican pugilist, to seize upon the issue and create the ad attacking the Democratic nominee. The ad succeeded in painting Mr. Dukakis as soft on crime \xe2\x80\x94 never mind that at that time, furlough programs were common across the country.'b'The racial implications of the Willie Horton ad were never subtle. In 1982, Mr. Atwater outlined with alarming candor this so-called 'b'Southern strategy'b' for appealing to white voters. He noted that candidates couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be as explicitly racist as in years past. That \xe2\x80\x9cbackfires,\xe2\x80\x9d he noted. \xe2\x80\x9cSo you say stuff like \xe2\x80\x98forced busing,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98states\xe2\x80\x99 rights,\xe2\x80\x99 and all that stuff.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Atwater eventually apologized for the ad, but the damage was done.'b'Ken Goldstein, a professor of political science at the University of San Francisco, said that by being played over and over on national news programs, the Willie Horton ad took on a second life.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost people didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the ad run,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people saw it on television news. TV loves airing ads, because you know what ads are? TV.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Willie Horton ad did not single-handedly win the election for Mr. Bush. It simply capitalized on the fears of (mostly white) American voters at that time. In this election cycle, no candidate has taken more advantage of those types of fears than Mr. Trump, according to Tali Mendelberg, a politics professor at Princeton and author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Race Card: Campaign Strategy, Implicit Messages, and the Norm of Equality.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRepublicans win largely with support from white voters, so they have incentives to rally their base around racial fears and resentments,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only trick to that strategy is not to run afoul of norms of racial equality that prohibit sounding explicitly racist. Trump more than anyone else in modern American history is loosening that norm.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Willie Horton ad, then, is a clear example of how political debates can be won: through the precise, tactical application of fear, no matter the moral consequences. And that line of attack isn\xe2\x80\x99t likely to die out anytime soon.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRace is effective because it divides,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott Reed, a Republican consultant, 'b'wrote'b' of the ad in 2004. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not looking to boost turnout and include people in your campaign. You\xe2\x80\x99re hoping to actually send people home.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The debate surrounding sanctuary cities offers a more modern example of racially charged rhetoric like the Horton ad. In the 1980s, sanctuary city policies caught on around the country. The policies 'b'were intended'b' to encourage people to report a crime, enroll their children in school, or go to the emergency room without the fear of being asked about their immigration status. There is evidence that sanctuary cities 'b'tend to be safer'b' than non-sanctuary cities.'b'This past summer, the topic of sanctuary cities gained new political life among Republicans. In July, 32-year-old Kathryn Steinle was shot in San Francisco by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times before. Evidence 'b'suggests'b' that the shooting was an accident, but that didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop it from becoming politicized. After the shooting, both Mr. Cruz and Senator Rand Paul introduced bills to block sanctuary cities. Mr. Trump has called for a ban on sanctuary cities, saying he is the \xe2\x80\x9conly one who can fix\xe2\x80\x9d the situation, while Ms. Steinle\xe2\x80\x99s brother 'b'complained'b' that Mr. Trump politicized his sister\xe2\x80\x99s death.'b'The Republican candidates\xe2\x80\x99 implied reasoning here is that illegal immigrants pose a threat to city dwellers\xe2\x80\x99 safety. John Sides, a professor of political science at George Washington University, said the rhetoric of the Willie Horton ad mirrors the rhetoric candidates have taken with regard to illegal immigration.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot disentangle Horton from his race,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou cannot disentangle sanctuary cities from Latinos and Hispanics, for the most part. They\xe2\x80\x99re parallel in that sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As humans, we tend to 'b'fear the wrong things'b', assigning more risk to scarier-sounding dangers and less risk to quotidian ones. We are more afraid of being in a plane crash than a car accident driving to work, even though the latter is 'b'much more likely'b' to happen.'b'Depressingly, appealing to voters\xe2\x80\x99 fears is often a 'b'savvy political strategy'b'; 'b'a recent survey conducted by Chapman University'b' found that nearly a quarter of Americans have voted for a political candidate out of fear. And reading the subject lines of some 'b'fund-raising emails'b', you\xe2\x80\x99d think a $3 donation was the one thing standing between your favored candidate and his or her certain death.'b'When we allow one bad actor to color our entire opinion of a sweeping policy, be it furlough programs or sanctuary cities, that\xe2\x80\x99s an example of the fear fallacy grinding into motion. We have a tendency to let our fears outweigh the level of risk they represent. And come election season, we see those fears laid bare, in a 60-second television spot.'b'In 1997, Michael Wayne Haley was arrested after stealing a calculator from Walmart. This was a crime that merited a maximum two-year prison term. But prosecutors incorrectly applied a habitual offender law. Neither the judge nor the defense lawyer caught the error and Haley was sentenced to 16 years.'b'Eventually, the mistake came to light and Haley tried to fix it. Ted Cruz was solicitor general of Texas at the time. Instead of just letting Haley go for time served, Cruz took the 'b'case to the Supreme Court'b' to keep Haley in prison for the full 16 years.'b'Some justices were skeptical. \xe2\x80\x9cIs there some rule that you can\xe2\x80\x99t confess error in your state?\xe2\x80\x9d Justice 'b'Anthony Kennedy asked'b'. The court system did finally let Haley out of prison, after six years.'b'The case reveals something interesting about Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s character. Ted Cruz is now running strongly among evangelical voters, especially in Iowa. But in his career and public presentation Cruz is a stranger to most of what would generally be considered the Christian virtues: humility, mercy, compassion and grace. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in the Haley case is almost the dictionary definition of pharisaism: an overzealous application of the letter of the law in a way that violates the spirit of the law, as well as fairness and mercy.'b'Traditionally, candidates who have attracted strong evangelical support have in part emphasized the need to lend a helping hand to the economically stressed and the least fortunate among us. Such candidates include George W. Bush, Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum.'b'But Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s speeches are marked by what you might call pagan brutalism. There is not a hint of compassion, gentleness and mercy. Instead, his speeches are marked by a long list of enemies, and vows to crush, shred, destroy, bomb them. When he is speaking in a church the contrast between the setting and the emotional tone he sets is jarring.'b'Cruz lays down an atmosphere of apocalyptic fear. America is heading off \xe2\x80\x9c'b'the cliff to oblivion'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d After one Democratic debate 'b'he said'b', \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re seeing our freedoms taken away every day, and last night was an audition for who would wear the jackboot most vigorously.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the Republican strategist 'b'Curt Anderson observed'b' in Politico, there\xe2\x80\x99s no variation in Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical tone. As is the wont of inauthentic speakers, everything is described as a maximum existential threat.'b'The fact is this apocalyptic diagnosis is ridiculous. The Obama administration has done things people like me strongly disagree with. But America is in better economic shape than any other major nation on earth. Crime is down. Abortion rates are down. Fourteen million new jobs have been created in five years.'b'Obama has championed a liberal agenda, but he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t made the country unrecognizable. In 2008, federal spending accounted for about 20.3 percent of gross domestic product. In 2015, it accounted for about 20.9 percent.'b'But Cruz manufactures an atmosphere of menace in which there is no room for compassion, for moderation, for anything but dismantling and counterattack. And that is what he offers. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s programmatic agenda, to the extent that it exists in his speeches, is to destroy things: destroy the I.R.S., crush the \xe2\x80\x9cjackals\xe2\x80\x9d of the E.P.A., end funding for Planned Parenthood, reverse Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive orders, make the desert glow in Syria, destroy the Iran nuclear accord.'b'Some of these positions I agree with, but the lack of any positive emphasis, any hint of reform conservatism, any aid for the working class, or even any humane gesture toward cooperation is striking.'b'Ted Cruz didn\xe2\x80\x99t come up with this hard, combative and gladiatorial campaign approach in isolation. He\xe2\x80\x99s always demonstrated a tendency to bend his position \xe2\x80\x94 whether immigration or trade \xe2\x80\x94 to what suits him politically. This approach works because in the wake of the Obergefell v. Hodges court decision on same-sex marriage, many evangelicals feel they are being turned into pariahs in their own nation.'b'Cruz exploits and exaggerates that fear. But he reacts to Obergefell in exactly the alienating and combative manner that is destined to further marginalize evangelicals, that is guaranteed to bring out fear-driven reactions and not the movement\xe2\x80\x99s highest ideals.'b'The best conservatism balances support for free markets with a Judeo-Christian spirit of charity, compassion and solidarity. Cruz replaces this spirit with Spartan belligerence. He sows bitterness, influences his followers to lose all sense of proportion and teaches them to answer hate with hate. This Trump-Cruz conservatism looks more like tribal, blood and soil European conservatism than the pluralistic American kind.'b'Evangelicals and other conservatives have had their best influence on American politics when they have proceeded in a spirit of personalism \xe2\x80\x94 when they have answered hostility with service and emphasized the infinite dignity of each person. They have won elections as happy and hopeful warriors. Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s brutal, fear-driven, apocalypse-based approach is the antithesis of that.'b'It has been distressing these past weeks to watch Poland, long the poster child of Eastern European states that shed the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s suffocating embrace, adopting dictatorial measures of its own, not least a right-wing, nationalistic assault on the country\xe2\x80\x99s media and judiciary. The European Commission is scheduled to examine possible sanctions on Wednesday, but it is unlikely to take any, in part because Hungary and other governments sympathetic to Poland would veto them and also because they would serve only to deepen Warsaw\xe2\x80\x99s hostility to the European Union.'b'Nonetheless, it should be made clear to the Polish government that its 'b'retreat'b' from the fundamental values of liberal democracy is reprehensible and foolish.'b'Since its victory in national elections in late October, the nationalistic, euroskeptic Law and Justice Party led by the former prime minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski has moved rapidly on 'b'its conservative agenda'b', packing the highest court with malleable judges, reducing the court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to block legislation, imposing greater government 'b'control'b' over the state-owned media, choosing a party stalwart previously convicted of abusing power to oversee the police and intelligence agencies and purging European Union flags from government press briefings.'b'This rightward swing, which mimics the politics of Mr. Kaczynski\xe2\x80\x99s friend, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, has inspired grumbling in the bloc about the way former Soviet vassals rushed to join the union and tap into its largess only to turn against its core values. Poland\xe2\x80\x99s shift is all the more frustrating because the Law and Order Party already had a crack at power under Mr. Kaczynski and his twin, Lech Kaczynski,'b''b' 10 years earlier, only to be ousted after two tumultuous years.'b'But however deplorable Poland\xe2\x80\x99s politics may be, they also reflect the enormous difficulties East Europeans have faced in assimilating the free-market economics and social liberties of Western societies from which they were forcibly separated for decades. Those challenges have been compounded by the sense of injustice that East Europeans feel at lagging, even now, well behind their Western neighbors in living standards.'b'These grievances are not unique to East Europe. Liberal democracy and its institutions elsewhere in Europe (and even, to some extent, in the United States) have been threatened by people frightened by the influx of large numbers of refugees and by economic uncertainty. Poland\xe2\x80\x99s Law and Justice Party is only one of many such reactionary movements that have cropped up in mature democracies.'b'The problem is that Mr. Kaczynski, and others who similarly perceive the European Union or the institutions of liberal democracy as a threat to their way of life, fail to understand that a union of shared values and liberties, and independent institutions to safeguard them, is the surest defense against the sort of dictatorship they endured under Communism.'b'Punishing Poland through sanctions would be counterproductive and even hypocritical, given the proliferation of like-minded parties across Europe. But that does not preclude European Union leaders from making clear to the Poles that Mr. Kaczynski\xe2\x80\x99s politics are a damaging deviation from the democracy Poland so ardently embraced 25 years ago.'b'Since the early 1970s, the right has conducted a sustained drive to gain power and set policy in the 50 states. The left, by contrast, has been far less effective at the state-level.'b'The sustained determination on the part of the conservative movement has paid off in an unprecedented realignment of power in state governments.'b'Seven years ago, 'b'Democrats had 'b'a commanding lead in state legislatures, controlling both legislative chambers in 27 states, nearly double the 14 controlled by Republicans.

The 'b'Obama'b' campaign spent $632 million to Mitt Romney\xe2\x80\x99s $389 million.'b'Away from the national level, the commitment of conservative donors to support a power shift in state government illustrates the determination of the right to eliminate regulatory and legal constraints on markets where their money has proven most productive.'b'Attempts to control the White House have become far more risky with the rise of a strong Democratic presidential coalition. In 2012, conservative groups 'b'put $700 million in a bid to win the presidency'b', two and a half times as much as liberal groups, but Obama still won decisively.'b'The states, it turns out, are more receptive to the drive of the Koch Companies and their corporate allies to protect their business interests.'b''b'The Koch brothers\xe2\x80\x99 have invested in such 'b'state-regulated areas as refining, chemicals, biofuels and ingredients; forest products; fertilizers; polymers and fibers. For the extractive industries, in particular, along with chemical, pharmaceutical, and lumber concerns, Republican-led deregulatory efforts can increase profits.'b'Wealthy liberal donors, on the other hand, are driven by ideological convictions that can be volatile and vulnerable, as Hertel-Fernandez and Skocpol put it, \xe2\x80\x9cto shifting donor fashions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In addition, investing in such national liberal causes as refugee resettlement, climate change, gay marriage, and voting rights has the appeal of participation on a high visibility issue \xe2\x80\x94 with the likelihood of public acclaim. Investing in state organizations provides far fewer public rewards.'b'The willingness of conservatives to weather difficulty and to endure prolonged delay has been demonstrated repeatedly over the past decades.'b'In 1973, as the Watergate scandal was closing in on the Nixon administration, conservatives financed the creation of two institutions: the 'b'Heritage Foundation'b' to counter the left on national policy, and the 'b'American Legislative Exchange Council'b' (ALEC) to foster state-based conservative lobbies, interest groups and foundations.'b'There was no short term advantage. 'b'In 1974'b', Republicans lost 48 seats in the House and four in the Senate. Republicans also 'b'lost over 700 seats in state legislatures'b', leaving them at their lowest level since 1938. After the election of Jimmy Carter in 1976, Democrats were back in power in Washington.'b'Conservative donors were undaunted. ALEC and Heritage continued to grow. When the right came back in full force in the election of 1980, Heritage was ready 'b'to offer a guiding hand'b'. Once Ronald Reagan took office, the Heritage Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s legislative blueprint, \xe2\x80\x9cMandate for Leadership,\xe2\x80\x9d became the Reagan administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'policy bible'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The elections of 2006 and 2008, in turn, were interpreted as sounding the death knell for conservatism. \xe2\x80\x9cThe new Democratic majority assembled by Obama represents the emergence of a Great Society electoral coalition,\xe2\x80\x9dPhilip Klinkner and Thomas Schaller, political scientists at Hamilton and the University of Maryland\xe2\x80\x94Baltimore County, 'b'argued 'b' in the January 2009 edition of 'b'The Forum'b'.'b'Nonetheless, conservatives maintained their investment in building state-level infrastructure, not only in ALEC but in the 'b'State Policy Network'b' and the interlocking foundations created by 'b'Charles and David Koch'b'.'b'The total investment of the right in state and local organizations now reaches well into the hundreds of millions.'b'In 2013, ALEC had a relatively modest 'b'budget'b' of $7.3 million. That figure, however, distracts from a much larger investment by the right.'b'When the 'b'State Policy Network 'b'was founded in 1986, it had 12 affiliated state-based groups and a goal of creating an \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate freedom network\xe2\x80\x9d to spread \xe2\x80\x9cthe growth of freedom across America until a permanent freedom majority is built.\xe2\x80\x9d Today, there are 'b'one or more affiliated organizations'b' in every state.'b'An examination of IRS reports from all of these conservative groups shows total spending in just one year, 2013, of $142.2 million, with the Texas Public Policy Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s $8.9 million the largest expenditure.'b'The State Policy Network\xe2\x80\x99s single year total of $142.2 million is dwarfed by the network of foundations financed by Charles and David Koch and allied donors, individual and corporate.'b'The complex transactions between the foundations in the Koch Brothers network obscure the dollar amount of their investments in state and local organizations.

ALEC, the State Policy Network and the Koch foundations had 'b' a ready-made conservative agenda'b' for newly empowered Republican legislators and governors, an agenda that has produced 'b'an upheaval'b' in environmental regulation, labor law, voting rights and reproductive rights.'b'Conservatives have some inherent advantages in building a state and local infrastructure.'b''b'Rob Stein'b', a founder of the 'b'Democracy Alliance'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a \xe2\x80\x9cpartnership\xe2\x80\x9d of liberal donors established in 2005 \xe2\x80\x94 pointed out in a phone interview that the right can tap into an embedded'b'Stein, who has worked in the field for decades, said that the result for conservatives is that'b'By comparison, Stein argued, \xe2\x80\x9cprogressives don\xe2\x80\x99t have these community based, indigenous resources to educate, organize and mobilize troops anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d With the exception of unions, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have fewer local places to gather and belong.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While organized labor remains influential in state elections, membership has 'b'collapsed to 6.6 percent in the private sector'b', and 'b'public sector unions'b' are under sustained assault. This week, the five-member conservative bloc on the Supreme Court appeared prepared to deal another blow to the union movement in 'b'Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association'b'.'b'In 2004, major liberal donors 'b'financed two new national groups created specifically for the 2004 presidential election'b' \xe2\x80\x94 Americans Coming Together ($79,795,487) and the Joint Victory Committee ($71,811,666).'b'Despite the investment, the Democratic nominee, John Kerry, lost. At that point, the liberal donor community came to general agreement that the left needed a secure a permanent infrastructure at the national level to compete with such conservative institutions as the Chamber of Commerce, the American Enterprise Institute, Americans for Tax Reform and Heritage.'b'A year later, Democracy Alliance established its goal of building a \xe2\x80\x9cprogressive infrastructure that could help counter the well-funded and sophisticated conservative apparatus in the areas of civic engagement, leadership, media, and ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At a national level, the alliance has played a significant role in the development of such groups as the 'b'Center for American Progress'b', a liberal think tank;'b' Catalist'b', which builds and maintains voter lists; and 'b'Media Matters'b', which seeks to document and discredit \xe2\x80\x9cconservative misinformation throughout the media.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last year, the alliance initiated a program to direct a portion of members\xe2\x80\x99 contributions to state and local groups. I emailed Gara LaMarche, the president of the alliance, to ask how reliable alliance members are in continuing their support of relatively low-visibility state organizations. His answer:'b'LaMarche described the response as encouraging, noting that the alliance aims \xe2\x80\x9cto at least double the contributions to the funds in 2016.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'LaMarche voiced some confidence that \xe2\x80\x9cDA donors will stay the course.\xe2\x80\x9d He acknowledged that'b'During our conversation, Stein, who had helped start the organization, raised some doubts:'b'How, Stein asked, \xe2\x80\x9ccould we have lost that? How does a communitarian world view lose its communitarian sense of self?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The short answer to Stein\xe2\x80\x99s question may be that the nature of political liberalism has changed.'b'The liberalism of the 1930s and 1940s was shaped by the Great Depression, and the response was, in many respects, communitarian: the strengthening of unions, the provision of jobs and government benefits to the poor and unemployed and the creation of a safety net to provide a modicum of security.'b'The left has, in part, shifted focus, with more stress on the values of self-expression and self-fulfillment, on individual liberation from the constraints of traditional morality, especially sexual morality \xe2\x80\x94 what my colleague Ross Douthat calls \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Liberalism of Adult Autonomy'b'\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe morality of rights.\xe2\x80\x9d Economic liberalism \xe2\x80\x93 despite progress on the minimum wage - has lost salience.'b'Instead of communitarian principles, the contemporary progressive movement \xe2\x80\x94 despite its advocacy of local issues like community policing \xe2\x80\x94 has produced a counterpart to conservative advocacy of free markets: the advocacy of personal freedom.'b'Insofar as liberals continue to leave the state-level organization to conservatives, they are conceding the most productive policy arenas in the country.'b'The federal government, currently immobilized by partisan division, is now incapable of enacting major new initiatives, left or right. The passage of Obamacare in 2010 was the last such initiative. States are the place where new programs and policies'b' are emerging'b' on an almost weekly basis.'b'As left interests are being cut out of this process, the 'b'groundbreaking work is being done'b' on the right. The losses for the Democratic Party and its allies include broken unions, defunded Planned Parenthood, lost wetlands and forests, restrictive abortion regulations and the proliferation of open-carry gun laws.'b'While the presidential race captures our attention \xe2\x80\x93 and as the left has withdrawn from low-level combat \xe2\x80\x94 conservatives have overseen the drawing of legislative and congressional districts that will keep Republicans in power over the next decade. In this way, through the 'b'most effective'b' 'b'gerrymandering'b' of legislative and congressional districts in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, the right has institutionalized a dangerous power vacuum on the left.'b'NEARLY 20 years ago, I was a social worker in a county jail where I first began to understand just how frequently the police deal with people with mental illnesses. Run-ins with the police were a regular occurrence for many of my clients, with officers often knowing them by name. They were overwhelmingly poor, and poor people with mental illnesses are also likely to experience homelessness and 'b'substance abuse'b' \xe2\x80\x94 issues that place them at increased risk of police contact and incarceration.'b'All too often, those interactions can end in violence and death, as was the case with 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier, who was shot and killed by a Chicago police officer last month. Responding to a 911 call made by Mr. LeGrier\xe2\x80\x99s father, officers found Mr. LeGrier wielding a baseball bat, and one officer quickly opened fire.'b'This was not Mr. LeGrier\xe2\x80\x99s first encounter with law enforcement. He\xe2\x80\x99d had several confrontations with the police at the university he\xe2\x80\x99d attended in recent months \xe2\x80\x94 at least one of these incidents involved officers\xe2\x80\x99 guns being drawn. His experience bears a striking resemblance to that of one of my former clients who was a college student in the late 1990s and who had several tense exchanges with the police as his symptoms worsened.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable is that, even about 20 years later, the police remain the primary responders to 'b'mental health'b' crises like these. According to data compiled by The Washington Post, of nearly 1,000 people shot and killed by police officers in the United States in 2015, 'b'25 percent displayed signs of mental illness.'b' And about 14 percent of individuals in American jails and prisons have a serious mental illness, which means that, for most officers, interacting with individuals with mental illness is an almost daily occurrence.'b'There are two simultaneous national crises \xe2\x80\x94 one of police violence and the other of inadequate mental health treatment \xe2\x80\x94 and we are making a mistake if we focus blame only on the police. They have become, by default, the way in which our society chooses to deal with people with mental illness in crisis, particularly in poor and minority communities. We need also to address the declining state of mental health services across the country.'b'Right now, we are moving in the opposite direction. Between 2009 and 2011, Mr. LeGrier\xe2\x80\x99s home state, Illinois, 'b'eliminated more than $113'b' million in community mental health treatment services. In Chicago, the number of public mental health clinics was 'b'cut in half'b' \xe2\x80\x94 to 6 from 12 \xe2\x80\x94 in 2012 as a cost-saving measure. Illinois\xe2\x80\x99s path follows the 'b'national trend of funding cuts for mental health services'b'. And of course these cutbacks primarily affect people living in poverty, who are 'b'already at heightened risk'b' of suffering from mental illnesses.'b'So that leaves the police as our de facto front line. To date, the dominant police model has been the Crisis Intervention Team (C.I.T.), which provides training on responding to mental health emergencies. 'b'Current research is as yet inconclusive'b' on whether this training actually reduces the use of force, and police departments struggle with training and dispatching trained officers to the right calls. About 15 percent of Chicago police officers are C.I.T. trained, while experts recommend training for at least 25 percent.'b'But training alone will not solve the problem of police violence against people with mental illnesses. A few cities, 'b'like San Antonio'b', have made strides in building a better system by integrating mental health services with law enforcement. We need to invest more broadly in a mental health crisis system to work in conjunction with the police.'b'For example, in domestic disturbance cases like Mr. LeGrier\xe2\x80\x99s, a triage mental health worker could quickly gather pertinent information, assess risk of harm and engage family members as part of a coordinated effort. A crisis team could respond to the call, with police assistance if needed, to determine the safest and most clinically appropriate disposition. A responsive system would have suitable support available, such as a triage center or respite beds to provide urgent services, which would offer a clinically driven alternative to the more typical choices of jail, the emergency room or the morgue.'b'This is tricky terrain \xe2\x80\x94 even promising new approaches won\xe2\x80\x99t completely eliminate fraught interactions between the police and people with mental illnesses, or the chance of violence on either side. But they provide a wider and more fitting array of responses that could go a long way to averting future violence or incarceration. They certainly would have helped many of the clients I worked with in jail.'b'We also need to wrestle with our own complicated attitude toward people with mental illness. Mr. LeGrier\xe2\x80\x99s death is a rare case of national attention being paid to a person with mental illness being gunned down by the police, perhaps because a bystander, Bettie Jones, was also killed. Just 10 days after the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and only a few miles away, a young man with mental illness named Kajieme Powell was fatally shot by the police in St. Louis. Mr. Brown\xe2\x80\x99s death incited widespread protests, but despite the fact that Mr. Powell\xe2\x80\x99s shooting was actually 'b'captured on video'b', his senseless death went largely unnoticed.'b'If we are to prevent future tragedies, then we should be ready to invest in a more responsive mental-health system and relieve the police of the burden of being the primary, and often sole, responders. For the sake of individuals like Quintonio LeGrier, Kajieme Powell and many of the clients I\xe2\x80\x99ve served, I hope we are.'b'LAST month, at the urging of Gov. 'b'Andrew M. Cuomo'b', New York\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Regents suspended the use of state tests to evaluate teachers. This is a wise first step, but it won\xe2\x80\x99t improve our schools unless we go further and build a professionalized system of support that views teachers as learners and challenges them to improve their classroom practices.'b'The national push over the last decade to strengthen how we evaluate teachers was rooted in studies that suggested that consecutive years with an ineffective teacher did lasting damage to a child\xe2\x80\x99s life chances. In response, many teachers\xe2\x80\x99 evaluations have been tied to how their students perform on state tests.'b'In 2010, New York began to develop a new teacher evaluation system, new tests and curriculums aligned with the Common Core standards. Most teachers agree that the standards are a step forward, because they ask students to think critically, write persuasively and solve real-world problems creatively. But New York\xe2\x80\x99s tests are still dominated by multiple-choice questions that don\xe2\x80\x99t measure this deeper learning. In many parts of the state, teachers did not have time to adapt their curriculums before new tests were used to evaluate them.'b'This created a crisis of confidence for parents, teachers and principals. Last year, an astonishing 20 percent of families opted out of the state exams. Parents worry that pressure to raise test scores makes school boring and stressful for their children. In many schools, there is still too much time spent on test prep, too much focus on students\xe2\x80\x99 weaknesses and not enough time for the in-depth learning the Common Core standards were meant to inspire.'b'Teachers don\xe2\x80\x99t trust the data being used to evaluate them. The evaluation system relies on tests designed for one task (measuring student learning) and uses them for another (measuring each teacher\xe2\x80\x99s impact). Good data is important but we have to use it for what it can actually tell us, not for what we wish it could tell us. Teachers regularly see margins of error of 25 points in the scores they receive based on their students\xe2\x80\x99 test results.'b'Even more troubling, the evaluation system has sent the message to principals that we don\xe2\x80\x99t trust their judgment. Principals are now required to follow a complex formula embedded in state law to arrive at teachers\xe2\x80\x99 ratings. If neither principals nor teachers trust the data in front of them, the process becomes a joke. In a system that was supposed to be more rigorous, fewer than 1 percent of teachers were rated ineffective last year.'b'In schools, the way adults learn always defines the way the students learn. Evaluations should have teeth, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not the mechanism that will put a strong teacher in every classroom. Schools need to nurture our students and our teachers.'b'How do we do this? We need to invest in teacher preparation and development. We hire thousands of new teachers every year, but many spend less than six weeks practicing as a student teacher and are never mentored by a strong educator before they start teaching.'b'High quality training for aspiring teachers would combine mastery of content and child development with a one-year residency alongside a master teacher. High-performing countries provide public funding to address this need. We need to make the same investment here.'b'We also need dedicated time weekly for teachers to meet in teams to improve their work. When teachers don\xe2\x80\x99t examine students\xe2\x80\x99 work together and discuss how to improve their teaching, they stop growing. When teachers stop growing, classrooms become dead zones where everyone is watching the clock. In contrast, when educators are actively learning with their colleagues, they understand their students more deeply, they hone lessons in response to their students\xe2\x80\x99 needs and they bring that lively thinking into their classrooms.'b'We must change the tests, too. Our current assessments still prioritize rote learning. If we want our children to use their minds well, our assessments must send a different signal to educators. Through the Smarter Balanced consortium, California and other states have developed assessments that adapt to students\xe2\x80\x99 levels and include assignments where students apply their knowledge to real-world problems. Here in New York, the state has granted waivers to a group of high schools where students defend research papers and scientific experiments in lieu of state exams. New York should examine both models closely before it spends millions more on new tests.'b'Finally, principals need the power to evaluate their teachers. It makes no sense to trust principals with the safety and educational future of children every day but refuse to allow them to fully supervise their teachers. School leaders need support to help teachers learn and the authority to act when teachers aren\xe2\x80\x99t succeeding. We must stop constraining them with rigid mandates.'b'We can\xe2\x80\x99t regulate our way to higher teacher quality, but we can teach our way there.'b'If you go to The Guardian\xe2\x80\x99s website these days you can find a section that is just 'b'labeled \xe2\x80\x9cProtest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' So now, with your morning coffee, you can get your news, weather, sports \xe2\x80\x94 and protests.

This week alone Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany faced huge protests after her justice minister declared that Arab immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 let in under Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s liberal refugee policy \xe2\x80\x94 were largely responsible for the mass sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve and used social networks to coordinate their attacks. President Obama actually cried \xe2\x80\x94 that was his unique protest \xe2\x80\x94 while trying to channel his outrage, and many other people\xe2\x80\x99s, into fixing our nation\xe2\x80\x99s crazy gun laws.'b'In my view, this age of protest is driven, in part, by the fact that the three largest forces on the planet \xe2\x80\x94 globalization, Moore\xe2\x80\x99s law and Mother Nature \xe2\x80\x94 are all in acceleration, creating an engine of disruption that is stressing strong countries and middle classes and blowing up weak ones, while superempowering individuals and transforming the nature of work, leadership and government all at once.'b'When you get that much agitation in a world where everyone with a smartphone is now a reporter, news photographer and documentary filmmaker, it\xe2\x80\x99s a wonder that every newspaper doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a \xe2\x80\x9cProtest\xe2\x80\x9d section.'b'I asked 'b'Dov Seidman'b', the author of the 'b'book \xe2\x80\x9cHow\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and C.E.O. of LRN, which advises companies all over the world on leadership and how to build ethical cultures, for his take on this age of protest.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople everywhere seem to be morally aroused,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seidman. \xe2\x80\x9cThe philosopher David Hume argued that \xe2\x80\x98the moral imagination diminishes with distance.\xe2\x80\x99 It would follow that the opposite is also true: As distance decreases, the moral imagination increases. Now that we have no distance \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s like we\xe2\x80\x99re all in a crowded theater, making everything personal \xe2\x80\x94 we are experiencing the aspirations, hopes, frustrations, plights of others in direct and visceral ways.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, we\xe2\x80\x99re being intimately exposed to footage of outrageous police brutality, terrorism victims jumping from the windows of a Paris theater and racially biased/sexist corporate emails revealed by hackers. Who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be aroused?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThink about this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seidman: \xe2\x80\x9cA dentist from Minnesota shoots a cherished lion in Zimbabwe named Cecil, and days later everyone in the world knows about it, triggering a tsunami of moral outrage on Twitter and Facebook. As a result, some people try to shut down his dental practice by posting negative reviews on Yelp and spray paint \xe2\x80\x98Lion Killer\xe2\x80\x99 on his Florida vacation home. Almost 400,000 people then sign a petition in one day on Change.org demanding that Delta Air Lines change their policy of transporting trophy kills. Delta does so and other airlines follow. And then hunters who contribute to Zimbabwe\xe2\x80\x99s tourism industry protest the protest, claiming that they were being discriminated against.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That we are becoming more morally aroused \xe2\x80\x9cis generally a good thing,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Seidman. Institutionalized racism in police departments, or in college fraternities, is real and had been tolerated for way too long. That it\xe2\x80\x99s being called out is a sign of a society\xe2\x80\x99s health \xe2\x80\x9cand re-engagement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But when moral arousal manifests as moral outrage, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cit can either inspire or repress a serious conversation or the truth.\xe2\x80\x9d There is surely a connection between the explosion of political correctness on college campuses \xe2\x80\x94 including Yale students demanding the resignation of an administrator whose wife defended free speech norms that might make some students uncomfortable \xe2\x80\x94 and the ovations Donald Trump is getting for being crudely politically incorrect.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf moral outrage, as justified as it may be, is followed immediately by demands for firings or resignations,\xe2\x80\x9d argued Seidman, \xe2\x80\x9cit can result in a vicious cycle of moral outrage being met with equal outrage, as opposed to a virtuous cycle of dialogue and the hard work of forging real understanding and enduring agreements.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Furthermore, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen moral outrage skips over moral conversation, then the outcome is likely going to be acquiescence, not inspired solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d Seidman added. It can also feed the current epidemic of inauthentic apologies, \xe2\x80\x9csince apologies extracted under pressure are like telling a child, `Just say you\xe2\x80\x99re sorry,\xe2\x80\x99 to move past the issue without ever making amends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With all of this moral arousal, it\xe2\x80\x99s as if \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re living in a never-ending storm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Alas, though, resolving moral disputes \xe2\x80\x9crequires perspective, fuller context and the ability to make meaningful distinctions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That requires leaders with the courage and empathy \xe2\x80\x9cto inspire people to pause to reflect, so that instead of reacting by yelling in 140 characters they can channel all this moral outrage into deep and honest conversations.\xe2\x80\x9d If we can do that \xe2\x80\x94 a big if \xe2\x80\x94 Seidman concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can be truly great again because we\xe2\x80\x99ll be back on our journey towards a more perfect union.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For a mayor happy to boast about his city\xe2\x80\x99s record low crime rates, Bill de Blasio has spent a lot of time lately talking about gun violence. As he should, because New York remains a dangerous and frightening city if you live in certain neighborhoods \xe2\x80\x94 in Brooklyn and the Bronx \xe2\x80\x94 still afflicted by gangs, drugs and shootings.'b'Horrifying reports of a gang rape in Brownsville 'b'this month'b' are just one reminder that New York\xe2\x80\x99s public-safety successes are incomplete, and that there is never time for complacency in deterring and prosecuting crime.'b'Mr. de Blasio announced on Tuesday two encouraging 'b'new approaches'b' in pursuit of a safer city: the creation of a specialized court in Brooklyn to handle gun-possession cases, and a \xe2\x80\x9cGun Violence Suppression Division,\xe2\x80\x9d of 200 police officers, mostly detectives, to handle illegal-gun cases and nothing else.'b'One thing to know about gun court is that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t drug court. Drug courts and other specialized courts try to keep defendants out of prison, to shield them from the worst of the justice system and put them on a better path in life. Gun court starts from a different premise, explained recently by Police Commissioner William Bratton: \xe2\x80\x9cThey need to be treated with every ounce of justice system that we can apply to them, to basically get them off the streets and keep them away from us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x9d being repeat offenders, often young men in street gangs, who are relatively few in number but blamed by the police for most gun violence. When New York first experimented with gun court \xe2\x80\x94 in Brooklyn, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg from 2003 to 2009 \xe2\x80\x94 it was trying to solve a dilemma: Shootings plagued some neighborhoods, but gun cases frequently dragged on and conviction rates were low. Justice was seen as slow, inefficient and inconsistent.'b'Mr. de Blasio\xe2\x80\x99s revived plan, an aide said, has the same motives: \xe2\x80\x9cto identify the strongest cases out of the gate\xe2\x80\x9d and to send them to two judges in two courtrooms in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn. The plan is to dispose of cases more quickly, to get high-risk repeat offenders off the street, with sentences appropriate to the seriousness of the crime, and not let low-priority offenders and bad cases languish in Rikers.'b'The long bottoming out of the 'b'crime rate'b' in New York City has been something to marvel at, but the challenge is to keep the gains from eroding while restoring law and order to the pockets of the city plagued by stubborn violence. There are many wrong ways to tackle that problem, including the ridiculously wide \xe2\x80\x9cstop-and-frisk\xe2\x80\x9d dragnet set by Mr. Bratton\xe2\x80\x99s predecessor Raymond Kelly, which harmed hundreds of thousands of innocent young men in the pursuit of a fractional subset of violent criminals.'b'Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Bratton say they are now doing the opposite, with a tack that is not necessarily harsher but smarter. Its success will rely not just on greater efficiency in the courtroom, but also on good policing on the front end, with well-trained officers respecting the Constitution and the residents of the crime-plagued neighborhoods they are pledged to protect.'b'The answer as always is the swift, sure and consistent application of justice, with stiff sentences where they are justified, and no neighborhoods left to fall through the cracks.'b'The fact that Americans start voting in a matter of weeks loomed over President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s final 'b'State of the Union address Tuesday'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cI know some of you are antsy to get back to Iowa,\xe2\x80\x9d he cracked, as he began the speech.'b'But as president, Mr. Obama gets to take time to crow about what\xe2\x80\x99s good in the economy, not just focus on fixing what\xe2\x80\x99s bad, as nearly all candidates of both parties are doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s a tricky line to walk and a nearly impossible one on the campaign trail, because, according to recent polls, voters 'b'mostly feel'b' that the economy still has a way to go until they will personally 'b'feel financially secure'b'.'b'Early in his speech, the president sought to quell the fears that the economy is on anything but stable footing. \xe2\x80\x9cAnyone claiming that America\xe2\x80\x99s economy is in decline is peddling fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said, adding later that any statement to the contrary is \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical hot air.\xe2\x80\x9d He listed a number of indicators of how strong the economic recovery he has overseen has been. And he\xe2\x80\x99s right. According to Bureau of Labor Statistics data, the 'b'unemployment rate'b' has been slashed, from 7.8 percent when he took office to 5 percent in the most recent jobs report. The private sector added more than 9 million jobs over that time. When it comes to the job market, the Great Recession is a thing of the past.'b'But the pain of it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. While Americans have by and large gone back to work, they\xe2\x80\x99re not seeing a whole lot more money in return. Wage growth has only 'b'chugged along'b' below or slightly above 2 percent since about mid-2009 as productivity growth \xe2\x80\x94 how much economic growth Americans are generating through their work \xe2\x80\x94 has grown much faster. That has come after 'b'decades'b' of wage stagnation for the majority of American workers.'b'Things are better for the rich, as income inequality has continued to grow and income gains have been heaped at the top of the income scale. According to an analysis by the economist Emmanuel Saez, the bottom 99 percent of Americans recovered just 'b'40 percent'b' of the income they lost in the recession by 2014. On the other hand, the richest 1 percent captured 58 percent of all income growth in the first five years of the recovery. Income inequality has in fact gotten worse after the Great Recession and under President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s watch. That dynamic makes people 'b'less happy'b'.'b'In his address, the president acknowledged that people still view the economy with some malaise. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the past seven years, our goal has been a growing economy that works better for everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made progress. But we need to make more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Signs of that progress are largely absent from the campaign trail, which may reinforce a negative view in the public\xe2\x80\x99s mind. During the debates, nearly every Republican candidate has brandished the fact that wages have been stagnant for decades. The Democratic candidates\xe2\x80\x99 focus has been on how to increase middle class incomes. There\xe2\x80\x99s little room for talk about the remarkable turnaround the economy has experienced over the last seven years. Given that positive change has yet to filter down into most people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, it\xe2\x80\x99s a tough selling point.'b'In his final State of the Union speech, President Obama endeavored on Tuesday to lift Americans above the miasma of a brutally negative presidential campaign to reflect on what the nation has endured and achieved since he took office in the midst of a dire recession.'b'The speech was, of course, a summary of his accomplishments, but more important, a reminder that the optimism that made him the first African-American president and then the resilience that helped the nation weather economic and global crises over the past seven years are what position it best for the future.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur unique strengths as a nation \xe2\x80\x94 our optimism and work ethic, our spirit of discovery, our diversity, our commitment to the rule of law \xe2\x80\x94 these things give us everything we need to ensure prosperity and security for generations to come,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'In his speech, the president said much depends on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 ability to address several key challenges: ensuring that opportunity is equally shared; harnessing technology for the greater good; keeping the nation safe without becoming the world\xe2\x80\x99s police force; and having political leadership that reflects the country\xe2\x80\x99s best values.'b'While acknowledging the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 determination to block most, if not all, of his initiatives, Mr. Obama noted some accomplishments that got through in the past year, notably last month\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'budget agreement'b' and a permanent extension of middle-class tax cuts. He credited the Affordable Care Act, his most important legislative achievement, for reducing the number of uninsured Americans.'b'But so much remains to be done, obstructed by a Republican leadership implacable in its hostility to Mr. Obama, determined to oppose just about everything he proposed from the day he entered office.'b'Efforts to curb gun violence remain on the White House agenda, though 'b'executive actions'b' may be all that the president can manage, given congressional intransigence. He spoke of the importance of immigration reform, despite his record deportation rates and the administration\xe2\x80\x99s harsh response to an influx of families fleeing Central American violence. Through executive action, Mr. Obama has given temporary deportation relief to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, but his bid to expand it to parents is in legal limbo.'b'On the chaos of the Middle East, Mr. Obama pointed to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to authorize war against the Islamic State, or ISIL, saying: \xe2\x80\x9cIf this Congress is serious about winning this war, and wants to send a message to our troops and the world, authorize the use of military force against ISIL. Take a vote.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He reflected on the administration\xe2\x80\x99s success achieving global agreements, foremost being the nuclear deal with Iran. \xe2\x80\x9cAs we speak,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cIran has rolled back its nuclear program, shipped out its uranium stockpile, and the world has avoided another war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If the accord proceeds as envisioned, it may emerge as Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s most transformative foreign policy accomplishment, though that bright promise is clouded by Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'bad-faith tests'b' of ballistic missiles.'b'Another foreign policy milestone was Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s decision to begin normalizing 'b'relations with Cuba'b', a move popular on the island and among Americans generally. He exhorted Congress to lift the current embargo.'b'With virtually no help from Congress, the administration achieved an impressive environmental record. It acted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles and power plants while presiding over a major expansion and investment in renewable energy sources. Mr. Obama also persuaded the Chinese to join the fight against climate change \xe2\x80\x94 an agreement that did much to ensure the success of the Paris 'b'climate accord'b' in December.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99ve got to accelerate the transition away from old, dirtier energy sources,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why I\xe2\x80\x99m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources, so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On jobs and the economy, the president pointed to a 5 percent unemployment rate and sustained growth. But Congress has blocked many job-creation initiatives, including more spending on energy and infrastructure. Still, the administration\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide meaningful mortgage relief in the financial crisis meant that many homeowners never got the help they needed.'b'The president closed his speech with an exhortation to improve the deplorable quality of the political debate now.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy fellow Americans, whatever you may believe, whether you prefer one party or no party, whether you supported my agenda or fought as hard as you could against it, our collective future depends on your willingness to uphold your duties as a citizen. To vote. To speak out. To stand up for others, especially the weak, especially the vulnerable, knowing that each of us is only here because somebody, somewhere, stood up for us. We need every American to stay active in our public life and not just during election time, so that our public life reflects the goodness and the decency that I see in the American people every single day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Those are inspiring words for Americans who are yearning for more civility from those in political life.'b'For the second time in three Supreme Court terms, the justices 'b'have struck down a Florida law'b' that treated the Constitution as little more than a speed bump on the road to quicker and easier death sentences.'b'In 2014, the justices 'b'invalidated'b' the state\xe2\x80\x99s rigid, unscientific rule that skirted the court\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'clear 2002 ban'b' on executing intellectually disabled people.'b'On Tuesday, in an 'b'8-to-1 decision'b' written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, the court rejected a Florida law that required a trial judge, and not the jury, to decide whether to impose the death penalty.'b'While Florida jurors first had to recommend a sentence, the final life-or-death decision was the judge\xe2\x80\x99s alone. This violated the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'guarantee'b' of a jury trial \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, that any fact that makes a person eligible for death must be determined by a jury. \xe2\x80\x9cA jury\xe2\x80\x99s mere recommendation is not enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Sotomayor wrote.'b'The defendant in 'b'the case'b', Timothy Lee Hurst, was convicted of murdering a co-worker, Cynthia Harrison, in 1998. After his original sentence was thrown out for unrelated reasons, a second jury recommended death by a 7-to-5 vote in 2012.'b'Justice Samuel Alito Jr. dissented from the decision, arguing that Florida juries play \xe2\x80\x9ca critically important role\xe2\x80\x9d in recommending a sentence to the judge. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change the fact that under state law, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision was the only one that mattered.'b'Of course, Florida is a death-penalty factory: The state has 'b'390 people'b' on death row, more than one in 10 of the nationwide total, and sentences more people to death than any other state but California. Duval County, which includes Jacksonville, currently has the 'b'highest per-capita rate'b' of death sentences in America.'b'But Florida isn\xe2\x80\x99t alone in conferring these powers on judges. In Delaware and Alabama, judges may override a jury\xe2\x80\x99s sentence of life in prison and unilaterally impose death \xe2\x80\x94 a power Alabama judges have exercised 'b'more than 100 times'b' (Delaware judges have not been using the authority). Florida and Alabama continued their practices even after the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2002 ruling in 'b'Ring v. Arizona'b', which held that only juries may make the factual findings that expose a person to execution. The logic of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s decision should call into doubt many of the death sentences in both states.'b'The jury\xe2\x80\x99s role in sentencing \xe2\x80\x94 particularly in capital cases \xe2\x80\x94 is central, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed over the last two decades. In a 'b'1999 case'b','b''b' the court called trials by jury \xe2\x80\x9cthe grand bulwark\xe2\x80\x9d of liberty, quoting William Blackstone, the 18th-century British jurist whose treatises are a foundation of American law. Blackstone warned that \xe2\x80\x9cdelays, and little inconveniences in the forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s decision was the right one, but it is also a reminder of how shamelessly some governors and lawmakers will work to undercut core constitutional protections in their crusade for more state-sponsored killing.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Is School Making Our Children Ill?'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 3):'b'Vicki Abeles commendably raises awareness of a real and growing problem with our drive for success and its impact on our students.

Meah, Pearland, Tex.'b''b'BEIJING \xe2\x80\x94 In 2010, I moved onto the 11th floor of a new Beijing apartment complex, lured into paying tens of thousands of extra renminbi by the promise of rare, unobstructed views. But over the past two years, Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s worsening smog has wrapped my apartment in a permanent haze. I envy the people living on the lower floors of what\xe2\x80\x99s called the Horizon Apartment Complex \xe2\x80\x94 at least they still see the trees and pedestrians outside. All I see is a gloomy, unhealthy fog. When the smog has been at its worst in recent weeks, no one in my family dared to venture outside.'b'Unfettered views of the horizon were possible five years ago because the complex is in a neighborhood on the edge of Beijing near an airport flight path, a swath of protected areas of farmland and villages where the government strictly controls land from being sold to developers. Residents are attracted to these parts by traditional rural scenes \xe2\x80\x94 fields, tree-lined roads, flowers and birds.'b'The cheap housing in villages like this one on the capital\xe2\x80\x99s outskirts has attracted high numbers of migrant workers who have come to the city from all parts of 'b'China'b' to work in factories. As a result, once-spacious courtyard homes are now divided into smaller crammed houses or sheds that are rented out cheaply to poor migrant workers. The city\xe2\x80\x99s outlying villages are big and growing.'b'I often see smoke rising up from these neighborhoods. At a distance, it can look as though the whole neighborhood is on fire. Only as I get closer can I make out the columns of smoke billowing from individual homes.'b'Last month, as Beijing was going through one of its worst ever spells of pollution, the government issued a report ranking domestic coal burning \xe2\x80\x94 for household cooking, heating stoves and water boilers \xe2\x80\x94 as the primary source of the city\xe2\x80\x99s pollution. But the report was only an official reminder of what we Beijingers have known for a long time.'b'As far back as 2000, in an attempt to reduce coal pollution, the government unveiled a plan to replace coal-fired boilers and cooking stoves with electric heating by subsidizing the conversion to electric appliances and electricity rates. Yet 16 years on, only some 310,000 homes in central Beijing have clean heat. This is a small number considering the central district covers an area that\xe2\x80\x99s less than 5 percent of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s total area and accounts for just a tenth of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s total population.'b'Without government subsidies, the mostly poorer residents living in Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s outskirts cannot afford to convert to electric appliances. For those who can scrape together enough money to buy an electric stove or heater, high electric bills are another deterrent.'b'Why does the government fail to act? One problem is skewed incentives. A main source of government and private wealth is the state\xe2\x80\x99s sale of village land to real estate developers. With Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s rapid population growth \xe2\x80\x94 from around 11 million in 2000 to 21.5 million in 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 and soaring housing prices, government officials have a financial incentive to move peasants and migrants from these townships in order to sell the land.'b'Razing villages to make room for expensive high-rise apartments will temporarily stop migrants from using coal, of course, but they end up just moving to other peripheral villages, where they use more coal. The government is reluctant to invest in these outlying villages because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be demolished anyway. In addition, improved infrastructure could spur villagers to demand higher compensation for relocation when the time comes to sell the land for new development.'b'Thus, the problem is the result of an interplay of the real estate market, greedy officials and the rapid urbanization of cities like Beijing.'b'As a temporary measure to improve air quality, the government has encouraged residents to switch from cheap, untreated smoky coal to smokeless coal with lower sulfate emissions. But smokeless coal is still coal. And many continue to use untreated coal, which scientists say discharges 10 times more pollutants than electric power plants.'b'China has made impressive strides in cutting coal emissions, with coal consumption down more than 5 percent in 2015, compared with a close to 3 percent decrease in 2014. Still, we are shunning coal at a much slower rate than many other developing nations. Not only do we still consume an annual four billion tons of coal, accounting for half the world total, our national target to limit the use of coal to no more than 65 percent of total energy consumption by 2017 also falls short when you consider that the world average already stands at just 40 percent.'b'In Beijing, replacing coal-fired boilers with electric heating systems has been proven an effective way of tackling air pollution in the city center. In November, the government expanded the program to an additional 74,000 households in a few select suburban counties. But it\xe2\x80\x99s far from enough. It only makes sense to roll out the same benefits to all people living in the villages on Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s periphery, so that they too can enjoy the advantages of electric heating \xe2\x80\x94 and so the whole city can breathe better air.'b'When the plan to subsidize electric appliances and electricity rates was first introduced 16 years ago, China was a poorer nation with shortages of electricity. Today we have surplus electricity, surplus construction materials and plentiful labor due to slower economic growth. Meanwhile, the price of coal has declined sharply over the past two years and yet the government has not reduced the price of electricity. If our government could only let market forces determine electricity rates, and stop prioritizing the demolition of Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s rural villages, and instead oversee their rapid shift to electric heating, we could achieve both stable growth and a cleaner environment at the same time.'b'In the early phase of the Communist revolution, Mao Zedong advocated starting his ideological crusade in the villages before moving into the cities. That might be a lesson for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s current leaders: Start a Green Revolution in the villages.'b'Sofia, Bulgaria \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cVLADIMIR VLADIMIROVICH, is war coming?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The question is asked in the first frame of \xe2\x80\x9cMyroporyadok\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWorld Order\xe2\x80\x9d), a manifesto-style documentary aired in the last days of December on Russian state television. And in the following two-plus hours, President 'b'Vladimir V. Putin'b', aided by diplomats, policy analysts, conspiracy theorists and retired foreign statesmen, attempts to provide an answer.'b'Though the Russian leader resists sounding the alarm, the audience is nonetheless convinced that if nothing changes in the coming months, the Big War could be imminent. And the Kremlin isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing much to dissuade them: Days after the film\xe2\x80\x99s airing, its new national security strategy, which declares NATO and the United States as fundamental threats to 'b'Russia'b'\xe2\x80\x99s future, was unveiled.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMyroporyadok\xe2\x80\x9d is a powerful expression of the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s present state of mind. It views the world as a place on the edge of collapse, chaotic and dangerous, where international institutions are ineffective, held hostage to the West\xe2\x80\x99s ambitions and delusions. Nuclear weapons represent the sole guarantee of a country\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty, and sovereignty is demonstrated by a willingness and capacity to resist Washington\xe2\x80\x99s hegemonic agenda.'b'The film\xe2\x80\x99s story line focuses repeatedly on NATO\xe2\x80\x99s bombing of Yugoslavia, George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s war in Iraq, the West\xe2\x80\x99s misuse of a United Nations no-fly zone in Libya and the West\xe2\x80\x99s insistent meddling in the domestic politics of post-Soviet states. This is all done to prove the film\xe2\x80\x99s central point: that the West may carry on about values and principles, but all of that masks a realpolitik aimed at world domination.'b'Some of the accusations have merit: The United States certainly bears considerable responsibility for the catastrophe in the Middle East. Some are patently false: Not every popular revolt in the world is a covert C.I.A. operation. But all of them carry more than a whiff of exaggeration. America, after all, is neither as powerful nor as malevolent as the Kremlin supposes.'b'The central contradiction in Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s view of American foreign policy is its failure to reconcile its insistence that America is a declining power with the tendency to explain everything that happens in the world as resulting from American foreign policy actions. Is Washington failing in its effort to bring stability to the Middle East? Or is keeping the region unstable the real objective of White House strategy? Improbably, Moscow believes in both.'b'More important, the film is a challenge to the widely accepted view of Mr. Putin as a coldblooded realist, a cynic who believes in nothing but power and spends his days poring over maps and checking his bank statements. In \xe2\x80\x9cMyroporyadok,\xe2\x80\x9d we find Mr. Putin the angry moralist who, similar to European populists and third-world radicals, experiences the world through the lens of humiliation and exclusion. As Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s close adviser, Vladislav Surkov, once wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cWe still look like those guys from the working part of town suddenly finding ourselves in the business district. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll swindle us for sure if we keep stumbling backward and dropping our jaws.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such exclusion fuels distrust and the tendency to view the world as a family drama structured around love, hate and betrayal. It is this sensitivity, rather than 19th-century realpolitik, that explains most of Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s policies in recent years.'b'Russian-Turkish relations are a case in point. Rather than adhering to any foreign-policy realism, the Kremlin seems to have adopted a policy of Great Power sentimentality. Until two months ago, Ankara was Russia\xe2\x80\x99s strategic ally in its struggle for a multipolar world. Turkey had been a brother-in-resentment, the only NATO member that refused to join in sanctions against Moscow after Russia\xe2\x80\x99s annexation of Crimea. Ankara occupied a central place in Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s energy diplomacy.'b'But it was enough for a Turkish missile to hit a Russian plane on the Syrian border, and suddenly the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was not a friend anymore, but a traitor who was \xe2\x80\x9caiding terrorists,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin said, sounding personally offended.'b'At the heart of Russian foreign policy sentimentalism is a tendency to view relationships between states as relations between leaders. It is this highly personalized view of the world that helps explain why Mr. Putin, the man who seeks to defeat America, is such an enthusiastic supporter of 'b'Donald J. Trump'b', the \xe2\x80\x9cbrilliant and talented leader\xe2\x80\x9d who promises to make America great again.'b'Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s predilection for Mr. Trump has nothing to do with the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s traditional preference for Republicans. It also can\xe2\x80\x99t be explained by the fact that had Mr. Putin \xe2\x80\x94 a physically sound, aging, gun-loving and anti-gay conservative \xe2\x80\x94 been an American citizen, he would have fit the profile of a Trump supporter. Nor is it a function of tactical considerations: that the nutty billionaire would divide America and make it look ridiculous.'b'Rather, Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s puzzling enthusiasm for Mr. Trump is rooted in the fact that they both live in a soap-opera world run by emotions rather than interests. Perhaps Mr. Putin trusts Mr. Trump because the American businessman reminds him of the only true friend the Russian president has had among world leaders, the former Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cMyroporyadok,\xe2\x80\x9d there is a lot of discussion about new rules and institutions, about Yalta and about the United Nations. But its message is clear: In a world where hypocrisy holds sway, only angry outsiders can be trusted.'b'Washington \xe2\x80\x94 JUST about every American chief executive has the same dream: to get out from under the corporate income tax. For many, that means lobbying Congress to change the tax code. But for a growing number, it also involves increasingly creative \xe2\x80\x94 and successful \xe2\x80\x94 tricks to avoid their liability.'b'The latest fad is inversion. Over the last few years, some of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest companies have arranged to be taken over by smaller companies, conveniently headquartered in the Bahamas or some other tax haven. A company then has to pay tax only in the tax haven; it escapes American corporate income taxes altogether. For example, 'b'Pfizer'b', the pharmaceutical company, is being taken over by a much smaller company with headquarters in low-tax Ireland.'b'Though the United States has the highest statutory corporate income tax in the developed world, write-offs and loopholes have eroded the government\xe2\x80\x99s take for decades. Corporate income taxes were just 1.9 percent of gross domestic product in 2014. That is down from an average of 2.6 percent in the 1970s, even though profits are near a postwar high as a share of national income.'b'The Obama administration is trying to crack down on inversions, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a losing battle. Other tricks will be found. Which leaves us with two paths forward. If we get less money from corporations, we have to make up the shortfall from other sources of revenue. Or we can come up with a radically new approach to corporate taxation.'b'The tax avoidance game is an enormous waste of resources and energy. We would like to see Pfizer focused on developing better drugs, not figuring out how to lessen its tax liability. The corporate sector as a whole devotes an enormous amount of money and brainpower to tax gaming, which contributes zero to the economy. Many of the financial wizards designing these schemes get very rich in the process, making tax gaming a factor in income inequality.'b'For these reasons we should be looking for better ways to extract a share of corporate profit for public uses. Fortunately, there is an old idea that could do the job.'b'Suppose that, instead of taxing corporate profits, we required companies to turn over an amount of stock, in the form of nonvoting shares, to the government. We can fight over the percentage later (we\xe2\x80\x99d want to match what we ideally get from corporate income taxes now, so presumably between 17 and 35 percent). But first we can focus on the principle.'b'The shares would be nontransferable, except in the case of mergers or buyouts, but they otherwise would be treated just like any other shares. If the company paid a dividend to its other stockholders, then it would pay the same per share dividend to the government. If it bought back 10 percent of its shares, then it would buy back 10 percent of the government\xe2\x80\x99s shares at the same price. In the event of a takeover, the buyer would have to pay the same per-share price to the government as it did to the holders of other shares.'b'This way, there is no way for a corporation to escape its liability. A portion of whatever profit it makes will automatically go to the government. It also eliminates the enormous cost and waste associated with complying with or avoiding the corporate income tax (there would be some start-up and monitoring costs, of course, but nothing like what current enforcement requires). And federal revenues will go up, because companies will have incentive to do what is most profitable, not what minimizes their tax liability.'b'If we currently had this system in place and Pfizer decided to move to Ireland, its buyer would have to purchase the government\xe2\x80\x99s stake at whatever price it paid for the rest of Pfizer\xe2\x80\x99s shares. Since we would presumably also require that foreign companies making a substantial portion of their profit in the United States grant shares, the Irish company would effectively still be paying taxes here as well.'b'Ideally, replacing the income tax with stock issuance would be mandatory. But it could be done on an optional basis. We could give companies a choice of paying the current income tax or turning over the designated percentage of shares to the government. If we pick the right number, many companies will go with the share option. This both gets us much of the way there, but also makes it easier for the 'b'Internal Revenue Service'b' to focus on the companies that didn\xe2\x80\x99t take the deal. They have told us with their actions that they think they can escape their tax liability.'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new idea, per se: It\xe2\x80\x99s been a popular \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if\xe2\x80\x9d among academic economists for years. But no one has brought it into the light of policy discussions, because until recently, the corporate-tax system worked reasonably well. You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be a committed left-winger to recognize that, increasingly, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case.'b'The switch from a corporate income tax to ownership of shares wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be good news for the tax avoidance industry, or for leading tax-avoiding corporations. But it would be a huge gain for just about everyone else.'b'SITTWE, Myanmar \xe2\x80\x94 How much should you sacrifice to save your husband\xe2\x80\x99s life?'b'And how much hardship do you inflict on your son to rescue your husband?'b'Those are the questions Jano Begum faced. Jano, 22, and her husband, Robi Alom, 30, are among the more than one million Muslims who belong to the Rohingya minority in Myanmar, subjected to an ethnic cleansing that 'b'a Yale study'b' suggests may amount to genocide.'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve written'b' several times 'b'over the years'b' about the 'b'brutalization of the Rohingya'b', but I know that for some readers it seems obscure and remote. Why worry about a distant people when there are so many crises in our own backyard? But put yourself in Jano\xe2\x80\x99s situation, as she sits in a hut in a concentration camp here, and think how far you would go to save your spouse.'b'Jano, Robi and other Rohingya have been confined since 2012 to concentration camps or isolated villages, stripped of citizenship and denied education, jobs and adequate food and health care. The conditions are calculated to induce despair. Sure enough, Robi proposed to his family that he join the wave of Rohingya boat people fleeing to Malaysia.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him go,\xe2\x80\x9d Jano recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were arguing.

A friend passed a message to Jano: He had hopped on a human trafficker\xe2\x80\x99s boat. He hadn\xe2\x80\x99t dared to say goodbye for fear that Jano would stop him.'b'Jano was wounded and angry, but she also understood. \xe2\x80\x9cHere we live in something like a prison,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNo jobs. No nothing. So that\xe2\x80\x99s why he left.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Rohingya feel abandoned. The United Nations system, with the exception of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, has downplayed the problem. Western embassies and governments have been too complacent. And Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner whose party just won elections in Myanmar, 'b'has been silent'b'.'b'In the same camp where I spoke to Jano I also met Arafa Begum, a 27-year-old widow who arranged with human traffickers last year to travel with her five children on a different ship to Malaysia. Arafa knew that she was at risk of being sold to a brothel, along with her daughters. But, not knowing how her children could survive if she stayed in Myanmar, she boarded a human trafficker\xe2\x80\x99s ship in July. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was almost no food or water,\xe2\x80\x9d she remembered \xe2\x80\x94 and conditions were hellish in the hold.'b'The ship sailed for 50 days, trying to sneak past the Thai Navy, but finally gave up. Arafa and her children are now back in the concentration camp, but she\xe2\x80\x99s thinking of trying again.'b'As for Robi, two and a half months after he disappeared, Jano received a message from a human trafficker in Thailand. He was holding her husband, and he demanded $1,200 for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'Jano sold belongings, borrowed from relatives and pawned her food ration card, managing to raise $500 and transfer it to the traffickers\xe2\x80\x99 bank account. In phone calls, the traffickers pressed for more money. Sometimes they put Robi on the line and beat him with sticks, so the family could hear his screams.'b'But Jano told them she had nothing left. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t quite tell me so, but she hinted that perhaps she could have raised a little bit more, but feared that their 5-year-old son, Muhammad \xe2\x80\x94 already hungry \xe2\x80\x94 would starve. I got the sense that she also thought the traffickers would capitulate and eventually release Robi.'b'If that\xe2\x80\x99s what she thought, she miscalculated. She received a final call from the traffickers: Robi had died in the jungle.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t raise the money, so they killed him,\xe2\x80\x9d Jano told me. After a long, aching pause, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI blame myself. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t save my husband.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear what happened. Maybe the traffickers beat Robi to death or killed him to sell his kidneys. Perhaps he died of malaria. Or perhaps they sold him to a Thai fishing boat on which he is enslaved.'b'Jano hasn\xe2\x80\x99t told Muhammad that his father may be dead. The boy is losing weight, from either worry or malnutrition. The family owes $200 to get back its ration card, so food is scarcer than ever. Jano washes clothes for neighbors, earning 20 cents a day to eke out an existence. (A human rights group called 'b'Fortify Rights'b' is trying to help her.)'b'Multiply Jano\xe2\x80\x99s tragedy by a million and you get the tapestry of the Rohingya suffering today. The horror arises not just from the savagery of human traffickers, but also from a government\xe2\x80\x99s systematic effort to destroy a particular ethnic group, one met by global indifference.'b'Genocide? I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. A stain on our collective humanity?

I gave them the unvarnished truth, the same way I would for my own boys. For me, it is very important to help children place themselves historically, even when that history is painful, because within that truth they can anchor themselves and from it they can aim themselves.'b'When my speech was over, we had a question and answer period, and President Obama came up.'b'I told the boys that whatever else the president does or doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do, his impact on young people of color will most likely be incalculable. As I told them: For many young people like you and like my own children, the first president they consciously registered was Barack Obama, a black man.'b'That afternoon, I flew back to New York, and that night I watched the president give his last State of the Union address.'b'The whole time I watched, the image of those boys was in my mind \xe2\x80\x94 smart, eager, hopeful. I thought about my 21-year-old son in the next room, still on winter break from college, who voted in his first presidential election in 2012.'b'I thought of some of the amazing pictures that the White House has released of the president meeting with black folks in the Oval Office, like 5-year-old 'b'Jacob Philadelphia'b' touching the president\xe2\x80\x99s hair because, as he put it, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know if my hair is just like yours.\xe2\x80\x9d I thought of all the boys being reached by the president\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy Brother\xe2\x80\x99s Keeper\xe2\x80\x9d'b' program.'b'These things register in a way that should never be underestimated. As a child, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t name many politicians, but I knew that P.B.S. Pinchback had been the first and only black governor of Louisiana, my home state; that Thurgood Marshall was a sitting Supreme Court Justice; and that Ed Bradley was one of the most respected journalists on television.'b'Obama is the first black president \xe2\x80\x94 and may well be the last, who knows \xe2\x80\x94 and that alone has a historical weight and impact on this generation that will play out for generations to come.'b'He has not been a perfect president. He has not been as vocal on issues facing the black community as some would have liked (for instance, I thought that he could have more explicitly addressed the Black Lives Matter movement in Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s speech). Nor has the plight of black America been dramatically altered during his two terms \xe2\x80\x94 it will take more than two terms of one president to undo hundreds of years of harm.'b'But he has simply, miraculously, won the position (twice!) and successfully negotiated the space \xe2\x80\x94 so well, in fact, that race is tangential to his record. He has opened yet another door of possibility, erased yet another myth of inadequacy, expanded yet another plane on which children can dream.'b'Indeed, as The New York 'b'Times reported'b' in 2009:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow researchers have documented what they call an Obama effect, showing that a performance gap between African-Americans and whites on a 20-question test administered before Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nomination all but disappeared when the exam was administered after his acceptance speech and again after the presidential election.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As The Times explained:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe inspiring role model that Mr. Obama projected helped blacks overcome anxieties about racial stereotypes that had been shown, in earlier research, to lower the test-taking proficiency of African-Americans, the researchers conclude in a report summarizing their results.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It has become something of a punditry parlor game, particularly as the Obama presidency winds down, to try to gauge how history will judge him.'b'A 2014 'b'Brookings Institution survey'b' of 162 members of the American Political Science Association\xe2\x80\x99s Presidents &amp; Executive Politics section ranked Obama as the 18th greatest.'b'But Brookings points out:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBeneath the surface of the aggregate figures lurks evidence of significant ambivalence. For example, those who view Obama as one of the worst American presidents outnumber those who view him as one of the best by nearly a 3-1 margin. Similarly, nearly twice as many respondents view Obama as overrated than do those who consider him underrated. One area where there is significant 'b'expert'b' consensus about the president, however, concerns how polarizing he is viewed as being \xe2\x80\x94 only George W. Bush was viewed as more a more polarizing president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For comparison, the institute provided other rankings:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe earliest major scholarly poll that included Obama was a 'b'2010 Siena College Research Institute survey,'b' which ranked him as the 15th greatest president. A 'b'2012 Newsweek survey'b' rated him as the 10th best since 1900, and a 'b'History News Network survey of historians'b' gave him an overall B- grade in 2013. 'b'Statistical mastermind Nate Silver\xe2\x80\x99s meta-analysis of multiple scholarly polls'b' placed Obama at #17, just behind John Adams and before Bill Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I believe that, on balance, history will judge this president favorably, but I won\xe2\x80\x99t hazard a guess at a rank.'b'That said, I\xe2\x80\x99m convinced that one of the biggest impacts this president will have will not be measurable, and therefore, not able to be ranked: his impact on young people like the boys I spoke to in Florida, an impact derived from just occupying his body and occupying the office.'b''b'PRESIDENT OBAMA'b' has described 'b'climate change'b' as one of the biggest challenges facing our country and has said he is open to new ideas to address it. He can start by supporting legislation to increase the nation\xe2\x80\x99s hydropower capacity, one of our vital renewable energy resources.'b'Hydropower harnesses the force of flowing water to generate electricity. It already produces about 6 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s electricity and 'b'nearly half of its renewable energy'b', more than wind and solar combined. This is enough electricity to power 30 million homes and, according to the Department of Energy, avoids some 200 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions each year. That amounts to taking 'b'about 40 million cars'b' off the road for one year.'b'But we could be doing much more to harness the huge potential of hydropower, even without building new dams.'b'For instance, only 3 percent of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 80,000 dams now produce electricity. Electrifying just the 'b'100 top impoundments'b' \xe2\x80\x94 primarily locks and dams on the Ohio, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas Rivers that are operated by the Army Corps of Engineers \xe2\x80\x94 would generate enough electricity for nearly three million more homes and create thousands of jobs.'b'And upgrading and modernizing the turbines at existing hydropower dams could yield a similar amount of additional electricity-generating capacity.'b'Despite the benefits of this technology, American hydropower development has stalled because of government red tape and environmental opposition. Less capacity has been added each decade since the 1970s, even as our infrastructure ages. Half of our plants use turbines or other major equipment designed and installed more than 50 years ago.'b'At the heart of the problem is a broken federal permitting process that has created an unnavigable gantlet for hydropower projects. While mandatory environmental reviews must be stringent to protect waterways and wildlife, federal bureaucrats insist on duplicative, sequential processes that exacerbate regulatory uncertainty, delay approvals and drive up consumer costs.'b'Compounding the roadblocks are environmental groups that claim to adhere to sound science but hold remarkably outdated views of hydropower and its benefits. Rather than acknowledge technological advances and the environmental safeguards in our laws, these groups have filed lawsuits to dismantle dams or stop their construction.'b'Add it all up, and it can now take well over a decade to relicense an existing hydropower dam. For the California customers of Pacific Gas and Electric, 'b'relicensing costs'b' have run as high as $50 million a dam \xe2\x80\x94 all for the privilege of continuing to operate an existing renewable energy project.'b'One-third of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s hydropower dams will require license renewals by 2030. We need to make this process more efficient by reducing bureaucratic and administrative delays that end up increasing electricity rates and slowing hydropower\xe2\x80\x99s expansion.'b'Fortunately, Congress has stepped in to get hydropower development back on track. Legislation in both chambers, including a measure in the Senate that was approved by a bipartisan vote in committee, would direct agencies to expedite the permitting of new projects and the relicensing of existing ones, and would advance the use of hydropower nationwide.'b'But while Congress has chosen to lead on this important issue, President Obama has threatened to veto the House bill, claiming it would undermine environmental safeguards. The challenge is finding a way to bring state and federal agencies to the table with the applicants at the beginning of the process so they can identify potential problems and coordinate environmental reviews. The legislation would not change the authority of federal agencies to impose environmental conditions.'b'There is much more that we can do. Upgrading existing dams is just one of the approaches that holds big promise. Coordinating hydropower projects on a regionwide basis might allow for permitting on a more timely basis and provide better opportunities for environmental mitigation. There is also tremendous potential for electricity generation using new marine 'b'hydrokinetic technologies'b' that convert the energy of waves, tides and river and ocean currents into electricity. And it is important to recognize the huge, untapped potential for hydropower in Alaska.'b'With hydropower, Congress has given the president an opportunity to address climate change and \xe2\x80\x9cbridge the divide\xe2\x80\x9d between parties. If he is serious about expanding the use of clean, renewable energy, he should at last give hydropower the attention it deserves in his final year.'b'Have you noticed how often family members are turning up in the presidential campaign?'b'Consider the irony of that Ted Cruz-Canada debate. Cruz was born in Calgary and Donald (\xe2\x80\x9cPeople Are Saying\xe2\x80\x9d) Trump has raised the question of whether that makes him ineligible to be president. We\xe2\x80\x99ll let constitutional scholars figure it out. But, meanwhile, we can enjoy recalling that Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s father, Rafael, once told a Texas Tea Party group that he\xe2\x80\x99d like to send President Obama \xe2\x80\x9cback to Kenya.\xe2\x80\x9d Hehehehe.'b'Even noncrazy relatives are popping up all over. This week Chelsea Clinton set off a major battle over Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s health care plan. There\xe2\x80\x99s been reporting on Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law, who was once a rather high-level drug dealer in Florida. Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s little daughters popped up in a political cartoon.'b'Remember Jeb? He was going to run as his own man, but people on the campaign mailing list are getting requests for donations from George H.W. Bush, George W. Bush, Barbara Bush, George P. Bush and Columba Bush. The family that fund-raises together stays together.'b'And how are we supposed to react to all this? Let\xe2\x80\x99s review a few rules:'b''b' Forget family members who aren\xe2\x80\x99t in politics 'b'\xe2\x80\x94 unless they hijack a plane or something. Don\xe2\x80\x99t hold it against Marco Rubio that his brother-in-law, Orlando Cicilia, served 12 years in prison on drug charges. Perhaps in a perfect world, when Rubio was a leader in the Florida Legislature and sent a letter recommending that the newly released Cicilia be given a real estate license, he might have mentioned that the ex-convict in question was something more than a typical constituent. But still.'b'In his memoir Rubio wrote about the trauma of the arrest, and coming home as a teenager to find his pregnant sister sleeping on the family sofa with her little boy. The image, Rubio wrote, \xe2\x80\x9chas remained with me all my life.\xe2\x80\x9d This is the only part of the story I would like us to consider a little bit, since the chapter does not end with Marco offering his sister his own bed for the night. Maybe he was too modest to mention it. But inquiring minds want to know.'b''b' Never make fun of children.'b' Not even if Ted Cruz puts his small daughters in a campaign ad in which the 7-year-old reads from a mock Christmas book called \xe2\x80\x9cThe Grinch Who Lost Her Emails.\xe2\x80\x9d A Washington Post cartoon portrayed them as trained monkeys and that was out of line. Leave the kids alone. When they\xe2\x80\x99re teenagers, they\xe2\x80\x99ll figure out their own ways to get revenge.'b''b'Adult relatives should generally get a break. 'b'Right now there are dozens of spouses, siblings and offspring of candidates staggering around Iowa shaking hands, thanking people for coming and recounting homey anecdotes about the time Dad or Mom flew a thousand miles to get to the school play. They\xe2\x80\x99re tired and they just discovered they\xe2\x80\x99ve gained seven pounds since that raccoon roast in Arkansas. Have mercy.'b''b' However, there\xe2\x80\x99s a limit'b'. We hardly need note that Bill Clinton gets no family-member slack, ever. Chelsea Clinton is a little different. In the past she\xe2\x80\x99s been superdisciplined. I remember back in 2000 watching her trot after her parents to the New York State Fair, looking dutifully at a life-size refrigerator carved out of butter, and thinking this is a whole new level of being a good daughter.'b'But Chelsea made news this week in New Hampshire where she told an audience that \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare \xe2\x80\xa6 dismantle Medicare and dismantle private insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a whole new line of attack, and you\xe2\x80\x99d at least expect it to come first from the candidate. \xe2\x80\x9cChelsea Clinton is as policy-obsessed and as smart and as attentive to the details as both her parents when it comes to policy,\xe2\x80\x9d said a Clinton spokesman. That\xe2\x80\x99s campaign-speak for \xe2\x80\x9cit was an accident.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Go for the jugular if the relative is saying something the candidate wants to say without being held responsible. 'b'This takes us back to Rafael Cruz, an evangelical minister who has claimed, among other things, that gay rights advocates want to \xe2\x80\x9clegalize pedophiles\xe2\x80\x9d and that if America had no abortions it would also have no national debt. His son is currently trying to court the far right without sounding quite that loopy in person.'b'Cruz talks a lot about his hyper-patriotic father, who came to the United States from Cuba on a student visa, worked his way through college and then began climbing up in the world. Actually, most of the climbing occurred in Canada, where Dad worked and became a citizen in 1973. The family came back to the United States, but Rafael didn\xe2\x80\x99t get around to becoming an American for 30 years.'b'The delay was due to \xe2\x80\x9cI guess laziness, or \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he once told David Welna of NPR.'b'Just saying.'b'Beginning with Ronald Reagan, I have voted Republican in every presidential election since I first became eligible to vote in 1980. I worked in the Reagan and George H. W. Bush administrations and in the White House for George W. Bush as a speechwriter and adviser. I have also worked for Republican presidential campaigns, although not this time around.'b'Despite this history, and in important ways because of it, I will not vote for Donald Trump if he wins the Republican nomination.'b'I should add that neither could I vote in good conscience for Hillary Clinton or any of the other Democrats running for president, since they oppose many of the things I have stood for in my career as a conservative \xe2\x80\x94 and, in the case of Mrs. Clinton, because I consider her an ethical wreck. If Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton were the Republican and Democratic nominees, I would prefer to vote for a responsible third-party alternative; absent that option, I would simply not cast a ballot for president. A lot of Republicans, I suspect, would do the same.'b'There are many reasons to abstain from voting for Mr. Trump if he is nominated, starting with the fact that he would be the most unqualified president in American history. Every one of our 44 presidents has had either government or military experience before being sworn in. Mr. Trump, a real estate mogul and former reality-television star, hasn\xe2\x80\x99t served a day in public office or the armed forces.'b'During the course of this campaign he has repeatedly revealed his ignorance on basic matters of national interest \xe2\x80\x94 the three ways the United States is capable of firing nuclear weapons (by land, sea and air), the difference between the Quds Force in Iran and the Kurds to their west, North Korea\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear tests, the causes of autism, the effects of his tax plan on the deficit and much besides.'b'Mr. Trump has no desire to acquaint himself with most issues, let alone master them. He has admitted that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prepare for debates or study briefing books; he believes such things get in the way of a good performance. No major presidential candidate has ever been quite as disdainful of knowledge, as indifferent to facts, as untroubled by his benightedness.'b'It is little surprise, then, that many of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s most celebrated pronouncements and promises \xe2\x80\x94 to quickly and \xe2\x80\x9chumanely\xe2\x80\x9d expel 11 million illegal immigrants, to force Mexico to pay for the wall he will build on our southern border, to defeat the Islamic State \xe2\x80\x9cvery quickly\xe2\x80\x9d while as a bonus taking its oil, to bar Muslims from immigrating to the United States \xe2\x80\x94 are nativistic pipe dreams and public relations stunts.'b'Even more disqualifying is Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s temperament. He is erratic, inconsistent and unprincipled. He possesses a streak of crudity and cruelty that manifested itself in how he physically mocked a Times journalist with a disability, ridiculed Senator John McCain for being a P.O.W., made a reference to \xe2\x80\x9cblood\xe2\x80\x9d intended to degrade a female journalist and compared one of his opponents to a child molester.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s legendary narcissism would be comical were it not dangerous in someone seeking the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest office \xe2\x80\x94 as he demonstrated when he showered praise on the brutal, anti-American president of Russia, Vladimir V. Putin, responding to Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s expression of admiration for Mr. Trump.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is always a great honor,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump said last month, \xe2\x80\x9cto be so nicely complimented by a man so highly respected within his own country and beyond.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s virulent combination of ignorance, emotional instability, demagogy, solipsism and vindictiveness would do more than result in a failed presidency; it could very well lead to national catastrophe. The prospect of Donald Trump as commander in chief should send a chill down the spine of every American.'b'For Republicans, there is an additional reason not to vote for Mr. Trump. His nomination would pose a profound threat to the Republican Party and conservatism, in ways that Hillary Clinton never could. For while Mrs. Clinton could inflict a defeat on the Republican Party, she could not redefine it. But Mr. Trump, if he were the Republican nominee, would.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the 2016 race has already had pernicious effects, but they\xe2\x80\x99re nothing compared with what would happen if he were the Republican standard-bearer. The nominee, after all, is the leader of the party; he gives it shape and definition. If Mr. Trump heads the Republican Party, it will no longer be a conservative party; it will be an angry, bigoted, populist one. Mr. Trump would represent a dramatic break with and a fundamental assault on the party\xe2\x80\x99s best traditions.'b'The Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s best traditions, of course, have not always been evident. (The same is true of the Democratic Party, by the way.) Over the years we have seen antecedents of today\xe2\x80\x99s Trumpism both on issues and in style \xe2\x80\x94 for example, in Pat Buchanan\xe2\x80\x99s presidential campaigns in the 1990s, in Sarah Palin\xe2\x80\x99s rise in the party, in the reckless rhetoric of some on the right like Ann Coulter.'b'The sentiments animating these individuals have had influence in the party, and in recent years growing influence. But they have not been dominant and they have certainly never been in control. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s securing the Republican nomination would change all that. Whatever problems one might be tempted to lay at the feet of the Republican Party, Donald Trump is in a different and more destructive category.'b'In these pages in July 1980, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic senator from New York, declared, \xe2\x80\x9cOf a sudden, the G.O.P. has become a party of ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d If Mr. Trump wins the nomination, the G.O.P. will become the party of anti-reason.'b'I will go further: Mr. Trump is precisely the kind of man our system of government was designed to avoid, the type of leader our founders feared \xe2\x80\x94 a demagogic figure who does not view himself as part of our constitutional system but rather as an alternative to it.'b'I understand that it often happens that those of us in politics don\xe2\x80\x99t get the nominee we want, yet we nevertheless unify behind the candidate who wins our party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination. If those who don\xe2\x80\x99t get their way pick up their marbles and go home, party politics doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work. That has always been my view, until now. Donald Trump has altered the political equation because he has altered the moral equation. For this lifelong Republican, at least, he is beyond the pale. Party loyalty has limits.'b'No votes have yet been cast, primary elections are fluid, and sobriety often prevails, so Mr. Trump is hardly the inevitable Republican nominee. But, stunningly, that is now something that is quite conceivable. If this scenario comes to pass, many Republicans will find themselves in a situation they once thought unimaginable: refusing to support the nominee of their party because it is the best thing that they can do for their party and their country.'b'The front-runner for the Democratic nomination is beset by scandal, trailing (some) Republicans in 'b'general-election polling'b', and at risk of losing to her socialist rival in the 'b'earliest two states'b'.'b'That same socialist rival is arguably technically further to the left than Donald Trump is to the right, he has higher polling averages than Trump, he\xe2\x80\x99s been drawing Trump-like crowds ever since he first declared his candidacy \xe2\x80\x94 and he\xe2\x80\x99s raising money hand over fist.'b'Yet the Democratic campaign has attracted none of the \xe2\x80\x9cThis Is Chaos!\xe2\x80\x9d coverage that\xe2\x80\x99s attended the Republican primary season, none of the garment-rending among pundits and political insiders, none of the talk about civil wars and permanent schisms and a party that may never be the same.'b'This has annoyed some anti-Trump conservatives, especially the sort that think it\xe2\x80\x99s just a ratings-obsessed media that\xe2\x80\x99s keeping his campaign so high aloft. But there are good reasons the Bernie Sanders insurgency has earned about a tenth of the media coverage of the Trumperd\xc3\xa4mmerung: No matter how high the Vermont senator rises in the polls, there\xe2\x80\x99s still a sense that he\xe2\x80\x99s in a friendly family squabble, not a bloody political street fight \xe2\x80\x94 and one that at some level, he appears to neither expect nor really want to win.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly the sense that a lot of liberals seem to have, which is why so much left-of-center commentary on the Bernie-Hillary battle has emphasized the positive, stressing 'b'how wonderful it is for the party'b' to have this kind of argument, how 'b'healthy it might be'b' that Hillary Clinton faces a strong challenge as she tunes up for the general election, how 'b'grateful progressives should be to Sanders'b' for nobly tugging the party to the left.'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s also the sense that Sanders himself has conveyed, most notably when he declined to hammer Clinton on her email troubles in the first Democratic debate. For much of the campaign, he\xe2\x80\x99s seemed acutely aware of his crusade\xe2\x80\x99s likely limitations \xe2\x80\x94 aware that Hillary is regarded very warmly by her party even if independents are more skeptical, aware that most of his voters will be not only willing but eager to vote for her in November, and aware that if his campaign seems more anti-Hillary than it is high-minded, he could lose the very thing that many liberals like about him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMudslinging is not part of the campaign strategy that Sanders and his advisers have crafted,\xe2\x80\x9d David Corn 'b'wrote'b' last summer for Mother Jones, previewing the Vermont senator\xe2\x80\x99s White House run. Indeed, in their ideal campaign, one longtime Sanders adviser suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cthere won\xe2\x80\x99t even be one speck of dust directly tossed at Clinton.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That strategy fits with Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s track record in Vermont, where he\xe2\x80\x99s long eschewed negative advertising. But it also fits with a candidate who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t honestly expect to win, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to compromise his purity and popularity in pursuit of a chimera.'b'But can Sanders sustain that high-mindedness if it suddenly seems as if victory, not just adulation, might be within his grasp? And can he sustain it if \xe2\x80\x94 as seems to be 'b'happening already'b' \xe2\x80\x94 his rising poll numbers (or even an Iowa victory) inspire the Clinton campaign to turn sustained fire on him?'b'The reality is that an insurgent campaign that actually wants to beat Hillary Clinton would need to exploit vulnerabilities besides her insufficient zeal for a single-payer health care plan. It would need to go after her, instead, at the intersection of policy and character \xe2\x80\x94 by linking the Bernie-Hillary difference on financial reform to the sordidness of the Clinton Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s global fund-raising, for instance, or by tying her recklessness with State Department emails to the fecklessness of the Libya intervention, and then linking that intervention to the issue that helped cost her the Democratic nomination in 2008, her Iraq-era hawkishness.'b'And such a line of attack would need to show some real passion, of the sort that infuses Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s denunciations of Wall Streeters, billionaires and the 1 percent. By contrast, here\xe2\x80\x99s how he critiqued Hillary on foreign policy in the 'b'last Democratic debate'b':'b'Again, this style is why so many liberals like Sanders: the Obama-esque nods to complexity, the historical call-outs to Allende and Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh, the \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not quite the fan\xe2\x80\x9d understatement of his critique.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a style that actually clarifies the stakes. For that, you would need to say something pithier, like:'b'Would Democratic primary voters actually want to hear this message? I\xe2\x80\x99ve 'b'long been skeptical'b', given how accustomed the left has become to dismissing Clinton scandals as small beer and papering over the larger Libya fiasco amid snickers at the right\xe2\x80\x99s Benghazi obsessions.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also a perfectly legitimate and reasonable argument to make, and one that\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly consonant with Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s progressive principles, if not his \xe2\x80\x9cno negativity\xe2\x80\x9d persona. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of argument that you\xe2\x80\x99d expect in a normal primary campaign, from a normal insurgent \xe2\x80\x94 the kind who wants to not just place, but win.'b'So as the polls tighten and Iowa draws near, there must be some part of Bernie Sanders that will be tempted, and sorely, to go ahead and make it.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s unfortunate that Gov. 'b'Chris Christie'b' of New Jersey started 'b'running away'b' from his own record on sensible gun controls as soon as he began his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Shameless pandering to voters in gun-friendly states has ensued. Mr. Christie abandoned his onetime fierce support of an assault weapons ban and reversed his opposition to armor-piercing .50-caliber rifles that have no place in civilized society.'b'Mr. Christie could still show some backbone by signing a measure the state Legislature passed this week, requiring retailers to stock \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d handguns that are equipped with technologies that allow only the owners to fire the weapons. As the technology advances, this approach could ease conflict on the gun issue between the two political parties; it would certainly save lives, particularly of children who too often happen upon unlocked family handguns.'b'Instead, the governor has belittled the idea of smart-gun technology. The state\xe2\x80\x99s 2002 smart-gun law requires gun stores to sell only smart guns three years after the technology enters the marketplace. But pressure from the gun lobby has prevented the development of such guns. The 'b'new measure'b' is intended to spur research and development by relaxing the older law by allowing the sale of traditional handguns alongside the smart guns.'b'Even the 'b'National Rifle Association'b' 'b'says'b' it is not opposed to smart guns in principle. However, like the gun industry it defends, the gun lobby has done nothing to advance ideas that are showing promise, including electronic and pistol-grip systems of owner-only activation.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s regrettable to see Mr. Christie\xe2\x80\x99s reversals as he woos the pro-gun vote, insisting he has simply \xe2\x80\x9cgrown up a bit.\xe2\x80\x9d He has renounced his past endorsement of strong state gun laws and wants to make it easier for residents to carry concealed weapons. As the presidential race approached, he vetoed a ban on the high-capacity ammunition magazines often used in the deadliest gun sprees.'b'If he really wanted to stand out at the Republican candidates forum on Thursday, Mr. Christie could advance the topic of smart guns as one way to ease the nation\xe2\x80\x99s gun mayhem. But of course that would start an actual debate among Republicans trying to duck the gun issue entirely.'b'Iraqi and American officials leading the military campaign against the Islamic State now have to wrestle with a challenge that has the potential to change battlefield fortunes: the slumping price of oil.'b'The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government'b''b' in northern Iraq, an oil-producing region, has racked up $18 billion in debt, which has imperiled its ability to pay state workers and security forces. This is especially worrisome since Kurdish security forces have been instrumental in rolling back the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s advances.'b'The government in Baghdad, meanwhile, is scrambling to avoid a budget shortfall this year. Iraqi officials last year obtained 'b'a $1.7 billion loan'b' from the World Bank and reached 'b'an agreement with the International Monetary Fund'b' that will allow it to obtain additional loans.'b'Baghdad is seeking to renegotiate with international energy companies new terms for oil contracts, which have become less advantageous for Iraq as the price of oil has crashed. And it is seeking a $2.7 billion loan from the United States to acquire military equipment.'b'Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s budget problems have rightly alarmed officials in Washington. While there is little appetite to bankroll a country where so much American money has been wasted and pilfered since the ill-conceived 2003 invasion, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s economic problems must be addressed. If they are to worsen, more Iraqis will almost certainly join the tide of refugees leaving the Middle East and the government will have a harder time rebuilding areas that Iraqi security forces have wrested back from Islamic State control.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re asking our partners and allies to increase their military aid,\xe2\x80\x9d Lukman Faily, Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the United States, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cIraqis are willing to do the fighting on the ground, so it would not be unreasonable to expect the international community to provide us with the military and logistics support to effectively wage this war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cash handouts like those America has provided over the years in Iraq and Afghanistan should be out of the question. But the United States could well offer the Iraqis technical advice and help the government secure access to credit from international institutions.'b'The 'b'International Monetary Fund'b' agreement forces Iraq to adopt reforms that will be healthy in the long run. These include measures and policies intended to wean the country from its near-absolute reliance on oil, and slashing wasteful spending by senior government officials. Iraq is also contemplating sensible measures it has long resisted, including fighting corruption, thinning its bloated state payroll and overhauling its taxation system. \xe2\x80\x9cIn some ways, our economic challenges are an opportunity for us to get our house in order,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Faily said.'b'Baghdad also must address the financial strains on the Kurdistan Regional Government. The Kurdish region, which includes three provinces, received a percentage of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s national budget until 2014, when Baghdad cut it off as part of a long-running dispute over oil revenue from fields in the north.'b'Desperate to pay salaries, officials in Iraqi Kurdistan 'b'have seized deposits at two branches of Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s central bank, a problematic and unsustainable course. 'b' Still, the government has been unable to pay state workers on time.'b'Brokering a compromise to the budget dispute between the Kurdish region and Baghdad won\xe2\x80\x99t be easy, because a broader fight over oil revenue in the north remains unresolved. But the United States and the international organizations that are stepping in to ease the budget crunch have significant leverage over the parties now. Allowing the dispute to drag on will make it harder to solve and give Islamic State militants breathing room.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Obama Urges U.S. to Embrace Change'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 13):'b'Such an eloquent speech, after so many months of dreary negativity from the party that obstructed President Obama from Day 1.

To protect women and to ensure that Europe can maintain the political will to absorb millions of refugees fleeing war and deprivation, the Continent will have to face this problem head-on.'b'More than 500 complaints have been filed with the Cologne police, most for sexual assault. Similar New Year\xe2\x80\x99s attacks occurred in Hamburg and Stuttgart. And the problem is not limited to Germany: The Swedish police are investigating a possible cover-up of assaults by migrant men at a festival last August.'b'Woefully ineffective policing is certainly to blame in Cologne \xe2\x80\x94 and must be improved \xe2\x80\x94 and Germany must also act swiftly against anyone convicted. The news that Ms. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s government is proposing changes to the law so foreigners guilty of sexual and other physical assaults can be deported will send a strong message that such crimes will not be tolerated.'b'Europe must also find a way to cope with a problem that has been largely ignored until now: sexual aggression by refugees from countries where women do not have the same freedoms as in Europe. Female refugees are often the first victims, reporting high levels of sexual abuse and violence, including being forced to \xe2\x80\x9cpay\xe2\x80\x9d smugglers with sex. They also report being abused by the police and other European men. More resources are needed to keep these women safe.'b'A broader challenge is how to acculturate large numbers of mostly young, Muslim men to the sexual and gender norms of Europe.

In what may presage a wider crackdown on dissent in Qatar, Sheikh Fahad bin Abdullah al-Thani \xe2\x80\x94 a cousin of the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani \xe2\x80\x94 was last month 'b'sentenced'b' to seven years in prison.'b'Sheikh Fahad was accused of shooting three officers as he stormed a police station in a bid to free his two sons, but the Qatari government\xe2\x80\x99s version of events conflicts with other witnesses\xe2\x80\x99. According to family members and others to whom I\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken, it was state security forces that did the storming, using armored vehicles against the sheikh\xe2\x80\x99s palace in Doha, the capital, last January. The sheikh and his sons, they say, were severely beaten during the confrontation.'b'Sheikh Fahad had a longtime dispute with the government over its seizure of some of his inherited land, according to his family. But opposition activists also believe that the arrest was in retaliation for the sheikh\xe2\x80\x99s political activities. According to the lawyer and human rights advocate Najeeb al-Nauimi, who is in contact with the sheikh\xe2\x80\x99s family, he is in prison in Doha.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis two sons have been released, but his arrest was arbitrary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Nauimi.'b'A former justice minister who has become an outspoken critic of the government, Mr. Nauimi represents dozens of Qataris who have suffered under the absolute monarchy\xe2\x80\x99s silencing of opposition voices. One of his clients is the poet Muhammad al-Ajami, who is 'b'serving'b' a 15-year sentence, after a secret trial in 2012, for \xe2\x80\x9ccriticizing the emir\xe2\x80\x9d in a poem that praised the Arab Spring. After the verdict, Mr. Nauimi said, \xe2\x80\x9cOur judicial system cannot be trusted.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Qatar has the world\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'third-largest'b' natural gas reserves and the 'b'highest'b' per capita income, yet its muffled opposition is one of the weakest among Persian Gulf countries. Pro-democracy activists want an end to bans on political parties and labor unions. In 2011, a petition submitted to the emir at the time, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, highlighted opposition demands. Signed by 19 Qataris, including Sheikh Fahad, it called for a raft of social, economic and democratic reforms.'b'One clause in the petition objects to the law that allows foreign residents, who make up the majority of the population, to own land. Qatari citizens 'b'represent'b' only 12 percent of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 2.2 million people now; that proportion, the petition claims, could be as low as 1 percent in 10 years. Qataris believe that allowing foreign land ownership has resulted in skyrocketing real estate prices and the growing economic marginalization of native citizens. Another clause takes the emir to task for spending millions of dollars on overseas projects while ignoring the well-being of his own citizens. Qatar has devoted hundreds of millions, for example, to 'b'pay the salaries of 'b'Hamas civil servants in Gaza.'b'It is no secret that Qatar has financially and politically supported the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been designated as a terrorist group by Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. From 2012, Qatar 'b'provided'b' about $8 billion to support the Brotherhood government of President Mohamed Morsi, before the ouster of Mr. Morsi in July 2013.'b'In December of that year, the Egyptian authorities arrested me and two of my journalist colleagues at the English bureau of Al Jazeera in Cairo. I was eventually 'b'pardoned'b', but only after 'b'spending'b' 438 days in prison on baseless charges of conspiring with the Brotherhood. We were victims of a crackdown on the press by the Egyptian government. But we were also victims of Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s policy of using the Arabic arm of Al Jazeera\xe2\x80\x99s network to support the Brotherhood against Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s rulers, which made me and my colleagues pawns in Doha\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical game. (I am 'b'suing'b' Al Jazeera for damages over its conduct.)'b'Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'backing'b' of Syrian Islamist rebel groups like Ahrar al-Sham and the Nusra Front has rebounded embarrassingly. A Western diplomat interviewed by The Daily Telegraph 'b'said'b', \xe2\x80\x9cThere are eight to 12 key figures in Qatar raising millions of pounds for the jihadis.\xe2\x80\x9d Much of this funding went to the Nusra Front, which is a Qaeda affiliate, although last year Al Jazeera reportedly 'b'instructed'b' its journalists not to describe it as such.'b'The report \xe2\x80\x9cQatar and Terror Finance,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'published'b' by the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies in 2014, exposed the country\xe2\x80\x99s permissive attitude toward Qataris who had enabled this financing. Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s participation in regional military coalitions against terrorism is in glaring contradiction of its support for jihadist groups.'b'The Qatari opposition in exile is headed by 'b'Khalid al-Hail'b', a reform-minded businessman who lives in London. In 2010, he helped form the Qatari Youth Rescue movement, bringing together hundreds of reformists residing in Qatar and abroad; he is now, he told me, founding a Qatari Democratic Party in London. Mr. Hail was jailed by the Qatari regime in 2010 and 2014, he said, and in the state security agency\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters, he was beaten, deprived of sleep and electrocuted.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not want to topple the royal family,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me in London last year. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we are calling for a constitutional monarchy where the legislation resides with an elected Parliament, not the emir.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Instead of Qatar\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'spending'b' millions of dollars with a host of public relations companies in the West, there is a simple way for the emirate to polish its international image and dispel concerns about its support of terrorism and poor human rights record: It should release Mr. Ajami, the author of the \xe2\x80\x9cTunisian Jasmine\xe2\x80\x9d poem, and Sheikh Fahad from prison.'b'I still hold onto a couple of magazine covers and newspaper front pages, despite their preservation in the digital afterlife, marking the moment when a nation that had embraced African-American slavery chose a black man to be its president.'b'Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s election in 2008 swept \xe2\x80\x9caway the last racial barrier in American politics with ease,\xe2\x80\x9d The New York Times reported. The New Yorker, with its cover of a glowing Lincoln Memorial, heralded \xe2\x80\x9cthe resurgence of America\xe2\x80\x99s ability to astonish and inspire.\xe2\x80\x9d They sensed \xe2\x80\x9cthe beginning of a new era.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help thinking of these trumpets of hope while watching the graying head of the president on Tuesday night. As he walked to the exit, he turned to soak in the scene of his final State of the Union address. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me take one more look at this thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'By any objective measurement, his presidency has been perhaps the most consequential since Franklin Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s time. Ronald Reagan certainly competes with Obama for that claim. But on the night of Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s final State of the Union speech in 1988, when he boasted that \xe2\x80\x9cone of the best recoveries in decades\xe2\x80\x9d should \xe2\x80\x9csend away the hand-wringers and doubting Thomases,\xe2\x80\x9d the economic numbers were not as good as those on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s watch.'b'At no time in Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s eight years was the unemployment rate lower than it is today, at 5 percent \xe2\x80\x94 and this after Obama was handed the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression. Reagan lauded a federal deficit at 3.4 percent of gross national product. By last fall, Obama had done better than that, posting a deficit of 2.5 percent of G.D.P.'b'Still, Obama can shape only so much of his own legacy. A big part of the 44th'b''b' president\xe2\x80\x99s place in the national narrative will depend on what happens to the forces of darkness that were unleashed in his time \xe2\x80\x94 things that can\xe2\x80\x99t be quantified by a government agency.'b'Much of the country is now more openly intolerant, quick to hate and nasty. One reaction to Obama has been the rise of an opposition party that is a home for xenophobes, defeatists and alarmists. They are the Eeyore Party with a snarl. As we heard again during the Republican debate on Thursday, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s opponents are drawn to the \xe2\x80\x9csiren call of the angriest voices,\xe2\x80\x9d as Gov. Nikki Haley of South Carolina artfully put it. If the majority follows those voices, the Obama presidency will shoulder a sizable amount of the blame.'b'Is that really his fault? Did his presidency give rise to a bigoted billionaire with know-nothing followers? Part of the ugliness seems a reaction to the straitjacket of political correctness, which preceded Obama, and got worse in some corridors, mainly academia. But it may also be that the country was not ready for a transformational president; rather than sweep away the last racial barrier, his years in office showed just how deep-rooted the sentiment behind those barriers remains.'b'These are tricky questions, ones that cannot be answered with certainty. But give Obama, the rare politician who is prone to honest self-reflection, credit for raising the issues himself. One of the \xe2\x80\x9cregrets of my presidency,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Tuesday, was that the \xe2\x80\x9crancor and suspicion between the parties has gotten worse instead of better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Could Obama, with that first-class intellect to go with a first-class temperament, with that pitch-perfect sense of humor, have been a better schmoozer and deal maker? Certainly. He was never very good at hiding his condescension for Republican leaders. But that party was united in a single goal \xe2\x80\x94 to defeat him at every turn.'b'Republicans who would not applaud the creation of 14 million jobs, an unemployment rate cut in half, 17 million people given health care, a global climate change pact, the strongest military in the world and a rousing call for a \xe2\x80\x9cmoonshot\xe2\x80\x9d to cure cancer are incapable of taking a fair measure of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s achievements.'b'This Congress is done with him. That was as clear as the blank prairie stare on the face of House Speaker Paul Ryan. What was a dysfunctional, bickering relationship is now a divorce. Call in the lawyers. Obama could propose Grandmother Appreciation Day and not get a single vote from Republicans because, well, he proposed it.'b'On policy, then, Obama has been a remarkable doer, though you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t know it from the curiously inept self-promotional apparatus of his White House. The swagger we saw from this president on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 saying, \xe2\x80\x9canyone claiming that America\xe2\x80\x99s economy is in decline is peddling fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cif anybody still wants to dispute the science around climate change have at it, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be pretty lonely\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was absent most of the last seven years.'b'But on the mastery of changing hearts and minds, the \xe2\x80\x9cability to astonish and inspire,\xe2\x80\x9d he falls short. His presidency, as of now, has not been transformational. He has 370 more days, or thereabouts, to make a dent in a hard history.'b'Gov. 'b'Andrew Cuomo'b'\xe2\x80\x99s new budget, released Wednesday, threw what looks like a gut punch at New York City: bam, hundreds of millions of dollars in state revenue suddenly pulled away. It was actually three punches: a proposal to withdraw state support for the City University of New York; a plan to require the city \xe2\x80\x94 and no other municipality \xe2\x80\x94 to cover the cost of increases in its 'b'Medicaid'b' program; and potentially costly changes in how the state runs its STAR income-tax rebates. 'b'All told'b', the cost to the city is expected to reach nearly a billion dollars in the coming fiscal year, and keep growing.'b'The budget development made an odd counterpoint to Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s State of the State address, also Wednesday, when he seemed to make nice with his frequent foil, Mayor 'b'Bill de Blasio'b', offering him, among other things, a partnership on homelessness and affordable housing, and $20 billion to pay for it. That was encouraging, especially for those who have worried about tensions between the governor and mayor resulting in destructive or vindictive policies.'b'But when people started examining the new $154 billion budget, it looked as if Mr. Cuomo was telling the mayor: New York has a surplus? I\xe2\x80\x99ll take that, thanks.'b'Mr. de Blasio was diplomatic in his response. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth the city and the state have a long-term interest in strengthening the financial status, and preserving the quality, of our public higher education and our Medicaid systems. We look forward to a coordinated effort.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the reaction from others was swift and blunt.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor New York City, I think this is one of the worst budgets that it\xe2\x80\x99s seen in a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d Maria Doulis, a budget analyst at the nonpartisan Citizens Budget Commission, 'b'told Politico'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of money, a lot of money,\xe2\x80\x9d said Carol Kellermann, the budget commission\xe2\x80\x99s president.'b'The Daily News used its front page to wish Mr. de Blasio luck in the Powerball lottery. (He didn\xe2\x80\x99t win, so that option is off the table.)'b'Mr. Cuomo says that the city shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be complaining, that the Medicaid and CUNY plans were part of an efficiency drive that in the end \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t cost New York City a penny,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it\xe2\x80\x99s not as if Mr. de Blasio is a total loser \xe2\x80\x94 with the budget anyway, given the state\xe2\x80\x99s pledges on affordable housing and homelessness, on funding for universal prekindergarten, community schools and other things.'b'It will be up to Mr. de Blasio to defend the city\xe2\x80\x99s interests, and for the city comptroller, Scott Stringer, whose office is doing its own analysis, to get to the bottom of the situation in the coming weeks of budget testimony in Albany. The Legislature will have its own say in the process. Maybe it really is a sincere effort to help CUNY and Medicaid, as Mr. de Blasio, perhaps wincing, says it is. But if the budget is as needlessly punishing as experts fear, Mr. Cuomo must not get away with it.'b'Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan is scrambling to deal with a terrible water crisis created by his administration in the city of Flint, which is poor and has a black majority. The damage to the nearly bankrupt city and its nearly 100,000 residents by lead-tainted water caused by corrosion in the pipes has yet to be totaled, but there is no doubt that the state has a moral obligation to provide clean water immediately for the citizens and to devise a long-term solution, no matter how costly.'b'The governor, a Republican, did virtually nothing to help the city until an outpouring of rage from Flint residents, city leaders, journalists and independent researchers forced him to wake up and focus on the calamity, 'b'which started'b' more than a year ago.'b'He had turned a blind eye, possibly because it was a destitute city whose elected officials had little political power and were under the thumb of an emergency manager Mr. Snyder had appointed. Or possibly because he wanted to maintain state control, he failed to call on the most obvious source of assistance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He finally sought, and got, aid from FEMA, which this week agreed to help with a long-term recovery plan.'b'Because of the state\xe2\x80\x99s actions, some part of the water distribution system within Flint, possibly all of it, may need to be replaced at a cost that city officials estimate could be as high as $1.5 billion. And thousands of children with potential brain damage from lead poisoning may need monitoring, nutritional support and special education to mitigate the harm caused by this man-made disaster.'b'This was a catastrophe caused by failures at every level. A task force appointed in October by the governor put the primary blame on the state\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Environmental Quality, whose director resigned in late December. According to the task force, the state health department apparently had early knowledge about elevated lead levels in the blood of children, but kept silent and did not warn the public. And one or more of the successive emergency managers appointed by Mr. Snyder to control spending in Flint signed off on bad decisions.'b'Flint\xe2\x80\x99s problems can be traced to a disastrous 'b'decision in 2014'b' to use water from the Flint River as the city\xe2\x80\x99s primary source of water for a year or two. Flint\xe2\x80\x99s water had for a long time been supplied by the Detroit system with water from Lake Huron. But in an effort to save money, the City Council, in 2013, approved joining a cheaper regional water system that was then still under construction. In the meantime, the city decided to draw its water from the Flint River. The critical decision not to add chemicals to prevent corrosion of the pipes that deliver water to homes and businesses was made at the direction of the state\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Environmental Quality.'b'As a result of corrosion, lead from the pipes leached into the water supply. In September, an outside expert reported high levels of lead in the water and a local medical center found high levels of lead in the blood of many children, who are especially vulnerable to long-term brain damage. State environmental officials belittled these findings, criticized the researchers, and told the public to relax, the water was perfectly safe. Of course, the researchers were right.'b'Mr. Snyder has appointed one task force to investigate how this problem occurred and another task force to find long-term solutions. Whatever fix is required, the buck clearly stops with him. This disaster occurred on his watch and he has to find the money, either within the state budget, from private sources or by begging for a handout from the federal government. Given his indifference until forced to act, outsiders will need to monitor the state\xe2\x80\x99s response to make sure it protects the health of the residents of Flint now and in future years.'b'Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s newly installed Parliament'b' began work this wee'b''b'k'b', though there is uncertainty about whether any laws it passes will be carried out by the country\xe2\x80\x99s authoritarian leader, President Nicol\xc3\xa1s Maduro.'b'Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s top court, which is controlled by Mr. Maduro, had 'b'issued a ruling proclaiming'b' that any laws the opposition-dominated National Assembly passed would carry no weight because a handful of lawmakers have been accused of electoral fraud.'b'The ruling, which disqualified three opposition lawmakers, was a preposterous attempt to prevent Parliament from making sweeping reforms the country desperately needs.'b'On Wednesday, opposition leaders agreed to sideline the three lawmakers for the time being. While that deprives the new Parliament, for the time being, of the sweeping powers it would have had with 112 seats, the minimum number needed for a two-thirds supermajority, the move eased a constitutional clash that many Venezuelans feared could unleash violence.'b'Parliament leaders nonetheless intend to start legislating in an effort to get political prisoners released and to start addressing the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic crisis.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine that the court\xe2\x80\x99s misbehavior will be the last attempt to undermine the will of Venezuelan voters. Mr. Maduro has been combative after 'b' his party\xe2\x80\x99s bruising'b''b' defeat 'b'during the 'b'parliamentary election'b' in December. Far from acknowledging that Venezuelans overwhelmingly support a new course, he seems intent on pursuing failed policies and unwise practices. For instance, he recently appointed a 'b'new economic chief 'b'who does not believe that inflation exists.'b'To make headway, the new Parliament will need sustained and robust international support. Leaders in the hemisphere should make clear to Mr. Maduro that they stand ready to invoke the Inter-American Democratic Charter, which censures a clear breach of democratic practices, if he and his loyalists continue to render the Parliament powerless through unconstitutional means.'b'Now that the opposition has made a concession on the three lawmakers, Mr. Maduro needs to acknowledge the authority of the new Parliament and find common ground with the opposition. 'b'Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution requires'b' that the president address the Parliament in early January. Mr. Maduro should do so without delay.'b'He recently suggested that he would send lawmakers draft legislation outlining measures the country can take to start mending the economy, which is reeling from low oil prices, absurd currency policies and soaring inflation. Making good on that promise would be a sign that Mr. Maduro is willing to work with lawmakers who were elected by the people.'b'Across the street from my apartment building in Washington there\xe2\x80\x99s a gigantic supermarket and a CVS. Above the supermarket there had been a large empty space with floor-to-ceiling windows. The space was recently taken by a ballet school, so now when I step outside in the evenings I see dozens of dancers framed against the windows, doing their exercises \xe2\x80\x94 gracefully and often in unison.'b'It can be arrestingly beautiful. The unexpected beauty exposes the limitations of the normal, banal streetscape I take for granted every day. But it also reminds me of a worldview, which was more common in eras more romantic than our own.'b'This is the view that beauty is a big, transformational thing, the proper goal of art and maybe civilization itself. This humanistic worldview holds that beauty conquers the deadening aspects of routine; it educates the emotions and connects us to the eternal.'b'By arousing the senses, beauty arouses thought and spirit. A person who has appreciated physical grace may have a finer sense of how to move with graciousness through the tribulations of life. A person who has appreciated the Piet\xc3\xa0 has a greater capacity for empathy, a more refined sense of the different forms of sadness and a wider awareness of the repertoire of emotions.'b'John O\xe2\x80\x99Donohue, a modern proponent of this humanistic viewpoint, writes in his book \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Beauty: The Invisible Embrace'b'\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cSome of our most wonderful memories are beautiful places where we felt immediately at home. We feel most alive in the presence of the beautiful for it meets the needs of our soul. \xe2\x80\xa6 Without beauty the search for truth, the desire for goodness and the love of order and unity would be sterile exploits. Beauty brings warmth, elegance and grandeur.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The art critic Frederick Turner wrote that beauty \xe2\x80\x9cis the highest integrative level of understanding and the most comprehensive capacity for effective action. It enables us to go with, rather than against, the deepest tendency or theme of the universe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By this philosophy, beauty incites spiritual longing.'b'Today the word eros refers to sex, but to the Greeks it meant the fervent desire to reach excellence and deepen the voyage of life. This eros is a powerful longing. Whenever you see people doing art, whether they are amateurs at a swing dance class or a professional painter, you invariably see them trying to get better. \xe2\x80\x9cI am seeking. I am striving. I am in it with all my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d Vincent van Gogh wrote.'b'Some people call eros the fierce longing for truth. \xe2\x80\x9cMaking your unknown known is the important thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Georgia O\xe2\x80\x99Keeffe wrote. Mathematicians talk about their solutions in aesthetic terms, as beautiful or elegant.'b'Others describe eros as a more spiritual or religious longing. They note that beauty is numinous and fleeting, a passing experience that enlarges the soul and gives us a glimpse of the sacred. As the painter Paul Klee put it, \xe2\x80\x9cColor links us with cosmic regions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These days we all like beautiful things. Everybody approves of art. But the culture does not attach as much emotional, intellectual or spiritual weight to beauty. We live, as Leon Wieseltier wrote in 'b'an essay'b' for The Times Book Review, in a post-humanist moment. That which can be measured with data is valorized. Economists are experts on happiness. The world is understood primarily as the product of impersonal forces; the nonmaterial dimensions of life explained by the material ones.'b'Over the past century, artists have had suspicious and varied attitudes toward beauty. Some regard all that aesthetics-can-save-your-soul mumbo jumbo as sentimental claptrap. They want something grittier and more confrontational. In the academy, theory washed like an avalanche over the celebration of sheer beauty \xe2\x80\x94 at least for a time.'b'For some reason many artists prefer to descend to the level of us pundits. Abandoning their natural turf, the depths of emotion, symbol, myth and the inner life, they decided that relevance meant naked partisan stance-taking in the outer world (often in ignorance of the complexity of the evidence). Meanwhile, how many times have you heard advocates lobby for arts funding on the grounds that it\xe2\x80\x99s good for economic development?'b'In fact, artists have their biggest social impact when they achieve it obliquely. If true racial reconciliation is achieved in this country, it will be through the kind of deep spiritual and emotional understanding that art can foster. You change the world by changing peoples\xe2\x80\x99 hearts and imaginations.'b'The shift to post-humanism has left the world beauty-poor and meaning-deprived. It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much that we need more artists and bigger audiences, though that would be nice. It\xe2\x80\x99s that we accidentally abandoned a worldview that showed how art can be used to cultivate the fullest inner life. We left behind an ethos that reminded people of the links between the beautiful, the true and the good \xe2\x80\x94 the way pleasure and love can lead to nobility.'b'How rich do we need the rich to be?'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not an idle question. It is, arguably, what U.S. politics are substantively about. Liberals want to raise taxes on high incomes and use the proceeds to strengthen the social safety net; conservatives want to do the reverse, claiming that tax-the-rich policies hurt everyone by reducing the incentives to create wealth.'b'Now, recent experience has not been kind to the conservative position. President Obama pushed through a substantial rise in top tax rates, and his health care reform was the biggest expansion of the welfare state since L.B.J. Conservatives confidently predicted disaster, just as they did when Bill Clinton raised taxes on the top 1 percent. Instead, Mr. Obama has ended up presiding over the best job growth since the 1990s. Is there, however, a longer-term case in favor of vast inequality?'b'It won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you to hear that many members of the economic elite believe that there is. It also won\xe2\x80\x99t surprise you to learn that I disagree, that I believe that the economy can flourish with much less concentration of income and wealth at the very top. But why do I believe that?'b'I find it helpful to think in terms of three stylized models of where extreme inequality might come from, with the real economy involving elements from all three.'b'First, we could have huge inequality because individuals vary hugely in their productivity: Some people are just capable of making a contribution hundreds or thousands of times greater than average. This is the view expressed in a widely quoted 'b'recent essay'b' by the venture capitalist Paul Graham, and it\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'popular in Silicon Valley'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that is, among people who are paid hundreds or thousands of times as much as ordinary workers.'b'Second, we could have huge inequality based largely on luck. In the classic old movie \xe2\x80\x9cThe Treasure of the Sierra Madre,\xe2\x80\x9d an 'b'old prospector explains'b' that gold is worth so much \xe2\x80\x94 and those who find it become rich \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to the labor of all the people who went looking for gold but didn\xe2\x80\x99t find it. Similarly, we might have an economy in which those who hit the jackpot aren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily any smarter or harder working than those who don\xe2\x80\x99t, but just happen to be in the right place at the right time.'b'Third, we could have huge inequality based on power: executives at large corporations who get to set their own compensation, financial wheeler-dealers who get rich on inside information or by collecting undeserved fees from na\xc3\xafve investors.'b'As I said, the real economy contains elements of all three stories. It would be foolish to deny that some people are, in fact, a lot more productive than average. It would be equally foolish, however, to deny that great success in business (or, actually, anything else) has a strong element of luck \xe2\x80\x94 not just the luck of being the first to stumble on a highly profitable idea or strategy, but also the luck of being 'b'born to the right parents'b'.'b'And power is surely a big factor, too. Reading someone like Mr. Graham, you might imagine that America\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy are mainly entrepreneurs. In fact, the top 0.1 percent consists 'b'mainly of business executives'b', and while some of these executives may have made their fortunes by being associated with risky start-ups, most probably got where they are by climbing well-established corporate ladders. And the rise in incomes at the top largely reflects the soaring pay of top executives, not the rewards to innovation.'b'But the real question, in any case, is whether we can redistribute some of the income currently going to the elite few to other purposes without crippling economic progress.'b'Don\xe2\x80\x99t say that redistribution is inherently wrong. Even if high incomes perfectly reflected productivity, market outcomes aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same as moral justification. And given the reality that wealth often reflects either luck or power, there\xe2\x80\x99s a strong case to be made for collecting some of that wealth in taxes and using it to make society as a whole stronger, as long as it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t destroy the incentive to keep creating more wealth.'b'And there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to believe that it would. Historically, America achieved its most rapid growth and technological progress ever during the 1950s and 1960s, despite much higher top tax rates and much lower inequality than it has today.'b'In today\xe2\x80\x99s world, high-tax, low-inequality 'b'countries like Sweden'b' are also both highly innovative and home to many business start-ups. This may in part be because a strong safety net encourages risk-taking: People may be willing to prospect for gold, even if a successful foray won\xe2\x80\x99t make them quite as rich as before, if they know they won\xe2\x80\x99t starve if they come up empty.'b'So coming back to my original question, no, the rich don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be as rich as they are. Inequality is inevitable; the vast inequality of America today isn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'At the Republican debate last night in South Carolina, Republicans were happy to talk about, and denounce, the budget deficit and debt. Senator Marco Rubio said that we must \xe2\x80\x9cbring our debt under control.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Rubio, like other G.O.P. candidates, rails against the deficit as a sign of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s moral failure. He advocates a balanced-budget amendment.'b'As a recovering Republican who retired in 2011 after serving on the House and Senate Budget Committees, I have concluded that this ritual denunciation of deficits and out-of-control spending is a fraud. Not only does the party not care about the deficit, but its practice since 1981 has been to worsen it.'b'We should pay particularly close attention to the Republican budget proposals from the presidential candidates in 2016. If a Republican is elected president, the party will almost surely have maintained control of Congress and, therefore, control the federal budget.'b'Since Mr. Rubio offers a detailed plan on taxes and spending \xe2\x80\x94 and since he is widely considered an \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d candidate \xe2\x80\x94 voters might carefully consider what his budget blueprint offers. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the short version: It draws on fantasy math that would wreck America\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal house.'b'On the tax side, Mr. Rubio slashes rates on personal and corporate income, and gives bigger breaks to wealthier Americans.'b'It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end there. Other candidates would reduce rates on capital gains and dividends, but Mr. Rubio would eliminate those taxes. He almost went out of his way to concoct a policy that would benefit the richest Americans: 'b'79 percent of current revenue'b' from these two taxes comes from the top 1 percent of earners, and less than 10 percent from the bottom 95 percent.'b'He would also end the estate tax. Republicans invariably call this the \xe2\x80\x9cdeath tax,\xe2\x80\x9d insinuating that it hits everyone unfortunate enough to die. 'b'Not even close'b': Only about 5,400 estates in America owe federal estate tax for 2015. But getting rid of it would add about $300 billion to the deficit over 10 years.'b'Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s policies would cause a tidal wave of red ink. A repeal of the capital gains tax would cost roughly $1 trillion over 10 years While there as yet is no estimate for the cost of dividend tax repeal, my best professional guess is a minimum of $250 billion.'b'His entire tax package would increase the deficit by 'b'at least $4 trillion'b'. But even Ramesh Ponnuru, a right-leaning columnist who approves of the plan, admits its price tag could 'b'be as high as $6 trillion'b' (the plan incorporates highly optimistic economic assumptions).'b'At the same time, Mr. Rubio piles on military spending. 'b'According to a Cato Institute analyst'b', his all-you-can-eat Pentagon budget could cost at least an extra $1 trillion over a decade. Based on my 28-year congressional career analyzing military budgets, I\xe2\x80\x99d say that\xe2\x80\x99s an underestimate. Among the 'b'many programs he wants'b', an additional carrier battle group, extra ground combat personnel (whose pay and benefits will be with us for decades), and missile defense could easily cost more than $1 trillion. For perspective, just one item, nuclear modernization, could alone cost 'b'$1 trillion'b'.'b'When I began work on Capitol Hill in 1983, President Ronald Reagan adopted policies devised by his young budget director, David Stockman, who came up with a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'magic asterisk'b'\xe2\x80\x9d in his documents to show that future deficits could be imagined out of existence by additional unspecified budget reductions. This deception allowed the administration to push through steep tax cuts and vast military increases. Over President Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s two terms, 'b'gross federal debt nearly tripled'b'.'b'Republicans have been largely budgeting by magic asterisk ever since.'b'In 1990, when the deficit hit almost 4 percent of gross domestic product and Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s successor, George H.W. Bush, called for a package of spending reductions and tax increases, Newt Gingrich led most Republicans to oppose the measure. He became de facto minority leader.'b'After that, no Republican would dare suggest tax increases, regardless of his promise to balance the budget.'b'By 1998, when the budget was finally balanced, Republicans claimed credit because they controlled Congress. But the real reasons for the budgetary improvement were Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s and Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s deficit reduction packages, which Republicans opposed, and the improved economy of the mid-1990s, refuting the Republican assertion that even the smallest tax increase would ruin the economy.'b'George W. Bush followed the example of Mr. Reagan rather than his father. I was dismayed that he proposed both tax cuts and military increases after taking office while squandering the opportunity to pay down the national debt, an idea that Republicans rhetorically supported during the 1990s. His policies turned a $236 billion budget surplus he inherited in 2000 into a $459 billion deficit in 2008, while in those same eight years doubling the national debt.'b'He left office discredited, but most Republicans have not changed. During my last year in the Senate, in 2010, the Simpson-Bowles deficit reduction commission offered a balanced array of 'b'military and domestic cuts along with tax increases'b'. While my boss, Judd Gregg (a rare and vanishing Republican fiscal hawk \xe2\x80\x94 he soon retired), voted for it, Republican deficit scolds like Representatives Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Jeb Hensarling of Texas voted against it, and the plan failed to secure the necessary supermajority.'b'Mr. Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s current fiscal plan is only in the middle range among the 2016 Republican contenders\xe2\x80\x99 budget-busting schemes: Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s would add about 'b'$3.7 trillion'b' to the deficit; Donald J. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s, an eye-watering 'b'$12 trillion'b'. Yet they all rail against what they call Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal irresponsibility.'b'Their consistently sorry fiscal record and proposals raise the question: Why hasn\xe2\x80\x99t the public caught on?'b'Republicans have been remarkably successful in delinking taxes from fiscal policy, \xe2\x80\x9cframing\xe2\x80\x9d taxes as a distasteful personal burden unconnected to widely desired public goods like roads, food-safety inspections or clean water. Instead, they claim that reducing taxes will spur so much investment the cuts will \xe2\x80\x9cpay for themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d Three decades of evidence have shown this claim to be false, but the candidates display ferocious discipline in pretending that tax cuts don\xe2\x80\x99t harm the budget.'b'The party also benefits from public ignorance of the federal budget. When voters think foreign aid is the largest item in the budget ('b'it is less than 1 percent'b'), or that we can reach fiscal balance by cutting waste, fraud and abuse, they are deluding themselves.'b'Working for Republicans, I learned the hard way that expecting the party to restrain the deficit, let alone balance the budget, is, in Samuel Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9cthe triumph of hope over experience.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Remember that phase of the campaign when Ted Cruz spoke no ill of Donald Trump, who returned the favor?'b'You may now forget it. Bury it. Write its obituary, in a pen dipped in acid.'b'At Thursday night\xe2\x80\x99s Republican debate, the two frontrunners didn\xe2\x80\x99t merely spar, as was expected. They glared at and scolded each other with a venomousness that was initially mesmerizing, then horrifying and finally just sad\xe2\x80\x94very, very sad.'b'The trajectory of the Republican primary has been one of growing pessimism, intensifying acrimony and abundant pettiness, and it reached its ugly nadir on the stage in North Charleston, S.C.'b'This happened when Cruz was asked to respond to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he might not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural-born citizen\xe2\x80\x9d eligible for the presidency. Cruz was ready for it, asserting that as recently as four months ago, Trump had sung a different tune.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSince September, the Constitution hasn\xe2\x80\x99t changed,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the poll numbers have, and I recognize that Donald is dismayed that his poll numbers are falling in Iowa.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The two men argued about what the numbers really said, Trump insisting that his were bigger. They battled over the legitimacy and motivations of a Harvard law professor who had weighed in skeptically on Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility. They traded barbs about Trump\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Yes, his mother.'b'Some of their lines were wicked\xe2\x80\x94some of Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s, at least. He\xe2\x80\x99s frighteningly talented at this sort of thing, and told Trump: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy to consider naming you as V.P., and so, if you happen to be right, you can get the top job at the end of the day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But as the scabrous exchange went on (and on) and John Kasich visibly slumped in frustration and the other candidates gaped in what seemed like genuine disbelief at the length of this endless digression, it was impossible to be entertained or amused.'b'The only sane response was sorrow\xe2\x80\x94that 'b'this 'b'is a presidential election in the greatest democracy on earth, and that blowhards like Trump and Cruz are, for now, setting the pace and the terms in one of our two major political parties.'b'Over the course of this sixth meeting of the leading Republican candidates, serious issues were indeed broached, and the candidates raised legitimate questions about what President Obama had and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t done to make Americans feel safe. They had a warranted discussion about whether the American economy had improved enough and in the right ways.'b'But the tone eclipsed the substance, and the tone was nastier than it had to be, sometimes to the point of pure silliness.'b'With the Iowa caucuses less than three weeks away, the New Hampshire primary right after that and several of the seven men onstage still looking for elusive traction, they went for broke: exaggerated words, extreme claims, voices raised high and chests puffed out as never before.'b'Trump was, as ever, at center stage.'b'For such a small-minded man, he hovers so large over this country\xe2\x80\x99s political landscape, casting the longest and most sinister of shadows. He was the sire of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address, which could be heard as a point-by-point retort to the gloom, doom and bigotry that Trump peddles. He was the sire of Nikki Haley\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union response, which was as concerned with chastising him as with contradicting the president.'b'And he was the sire of this debate, inasmuch as the anger that he summons and the uncompromising toughness that he projects have infected his adversaries, tugging them toward truculence. On Thursday night, several of them seemed intent on out-Trumping Trump.'b'Chris Christie didn\xe2\x80\x99t merely portray himself as the most effective opponent for Hillary Clinton.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I\xe2\x80\x99m the nominee, she won\xe2\x80\x99t get within 10 miles of the White House,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed.'b'He didn\xe2\x80\x99t merely state his differences with Obama. He compared the president to \xe2\x80\x9ca petulant child\xe2\x80\x9d and made him a promise.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to kick your rear end out of the White House come this fall,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.

NERENBERG'b'New York'b''b'The writer is an immigration lawyer.'b''b'NEW DELHI \xe2\x80\x94 There are moments in a republic\xe2\x80\x99s life when its governing institutions choose efficiency over democracy. Dec. 10, 2015, when 'b'India'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a state law barring wide swaths of the population from contesting elections for village and district councils, was one such moment.'b'That day the court endorsed a law passed by Haryana, a small state bordering on Delhi, in September 2015. The Haryana Panchayati Raj (Amendment) Act disqualifies from local political office citizens who have been formally charged with serious crimes, citizens who are behind on loan payments to rural cooperative banks, citizens who haven\xe2\x80\x99t paid their electricity bills, citizens who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a functional lavatory at home and citizens who lack certain educational qualifications. (All these people may still vote.)'b'The stipulation that men running for local office should have high school diplomas and that women and Dalit candidates should have completed middle school was the most controversial part of the amendment, because it would disqualify about one half of Haryana\xe2\x80\x99s rural voters. For that reason, the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decision upholding the law, \xe2\x80\x9cRajbala and Others vs. the State of Haryana and Others,\xe2\x80\x9d is a landmark in conservative jurisprudence and a dangerous departure from the ideal of a participatory democracy.'b'It is also a deviation from the Indian republic\xe2\x80\x99s original idea of itself. Immediately after independence in 1947, the constituent assembly debated whether educational requirements should apply to either voters or political representatives. It decided against both options, prizing universal suffrage and political inclusiveness over any other consideration. Given that back then India\xe2\x80\x99s literacy rate hovered around 12 percent, this was a heroic bet on mass democracy.'b'And it paid off: India has had more than six decades of stable, elected governance.'b'So why, then, would the Haryana legislature try to fix something that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t broken? And it\xe2\x80\x99s not just Haryana: Rajasthan, a much larger state, passed a bill with similar educational requirements last March.'b'The attorney general of Haryana argued before the Supreme Court that the state\xe2\x80\x99s government wanted \xe2\x80\x9cmodel representatives for local self-government for better administrative efficiency.\xe2\x80\x9d Literate \xe2\x80\x94 as well as debt-free and toilet-endowed etc. \xe2\x80\x94 representatives would not only set an example for rural fellow-citizens, the argument went; they would also make better administrators.'b'There are two major problems with this claim, and both were presented to the Supreme Court by the petitioners in the case, three women in office who would have been ineligible for their posts under the amended law. The first problem is inconsistency. Under the new law, a citizen in Haryana must meet a much higher educational requirement to run for the lowest tier of local government than to contest elections for the state legislature or even the national Parliament.'b'The second problem is that the law, in effect, punishes the poorer half of Haryana\xe2\x80\x99s population for the failure of both state and national authorities to provide free education to all Indians.'b'Yet the two-judge bench of the Supreme Court, citing judicial restraint, stated that it was its business to examine not the wisdom of the bill, but only its constitutionality: The judges would strike down the law only if the Haryana legislature had exceeded its authority in passing it, or if the law violated the fundamental right to equality of those it targeted by discriminating against them in ways that were arbitrary or irrational.'b'The judges decided the law passed muster because, given the importance of education to good administration, it was reasonable to exclude from office anyone with insufficient education. And if the principle of exclusion was sound at all, it did not matter how many people would be excluded \xe2\x80\x94 or that most of those excluded would be the poor, particularly poor women and poor Dalits.'b'Never mind, either, that the 73rd Amendment of the Constitution, which created the legal basis for village councils, bemoaned the \xe2\x80\x9cinsufficient representation of weaker sections like Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and women.\xe2\x80\x9d Or that in the same judgment in which they defended the educational exclusion on principle rather than effect, the same judges upheld the Haryana law\xe2\x80\x99s provision disqualifying debtors on grounds that it would affect only a minuscule segment of the population. (The indebted, they reasoned, were unlikely to contest expensive elections.)'b'The inconsistencies in this decision should be reason enough for the case to be re-examined by a larger bench of the Supreme Court. Another reason is the decision\xe2\x80\x99s possible seismic aftereffects: It opens the door to other attempts to qualify Indians\xe2\x80\x99 right to contest elections.'b'In a poor country like India the educated and the debt-free are, by definition, better off than those who are not educated or have debt. To designate the first as exemplary, or credit them with superior moral will, is to imply that the others are feckless and unwilling to improve themselves. In fact, those others are simply poor. And to limit the poor\xe2\x80\x99s access to office is to say that they deserve to vote but only for their betters, an attitude more appropriate to the 19th century than the 21st.'b'It is significant that Haryana and Rajasthan, the two states that have pioneered the education exclusion, are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party, India\xe2\x80\x99s principal right-wing party. Populist in idiom rather than intent, the B.J.P. appears to be using these two states as laboratories in which to test the chances of a broader conservative move to limit the political participation of the poor.'b'This vision of solid citizens leading the shiftless poor toward civic virtue is un-republican: It constrains liberty, corrodes equality and mocks fraternity. The founders of the Indian republic categorically rejected such paternalism; it should not be smuggled in today through the backdoor of local government.'b''b''b'ROME \xe2\x80\x94 A BALDING government clerk in his late 30s has one true love: \xe2\x80\x9cil posto fisso,\xe2\x80\x9d a job for life.

Give him a desk, a chair and a 9-to-5 job in the \xe2\x80\x9cpubblica amministrazione,\xe2\x80\x9d and he\xe2\x80\x99s happy.

The clerk loves them. Slam! Slam! Slam! When his boss, who wants to get rid of him, asks angrily: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat have you contributed to this department?\xe2\x80\x9d he shows her his stamping prowess, and almost demolishes her glass table.'b'This is, more or less, the story of \xe2\x80\x9cQuo Vado?\xe2\x80\x9d a new comedy that has smashed Italian box office records.

So what is it?'b'The clerk, Checco \xe2\x80\x94 played by Checco Zalone, a comedian from Apulia \xe2\x80\x94 is a simpleton with a good heart who strikes it lucky, an Italian Forrest Gump, with tagliolini instead of shrimp. The ministry wants him to resign; he refuses, and ends up relocated to the most unlikely places, from mob-infested Calabria to freezing Norway. There he falls in love with a biologist who challenges his habitual road rage. He becomes a good, law-abiding citizen, but Italy\xe2\x80\x99s siren call is too strong. So he goes back to his southern homeland, and to political incorrectness. Hilarity ensues: One day he shouts at a young boy who is about to clean a window, \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t! There are rules in this country. Leave it to her.\xe2\x80\x9d And he passes the cloth to a girl standing nearby.'b'Are Italians really that sexist? Are real Italians as passionate about that job for life? Not anymore, thankfully. But we love seeing a film that reminds us of what we have overcome. And it comes at a time when the public- and private-sector labor forces are diverging, in terms of their job protections, incomes and worldviews.'b'Italians aren\xe2\x80\x99t afraid of a more dynamic labor market. There is still the dream of making it in the private sector, even if it is less secure than the public-sector jobs that have long been the backbone of the Italian work force. Two out of three workers, according to a recent survey in the Turin newspaper La Stampa, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind taking a risk, as long as it meant the prospect of career advancement.'b'To foster this more proactive mood, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi \xe2\x80\x94 who has seen \xe2\x80\x9cQuo Vado?\xe2\x80\x9d with his family \xe2\x80\x94 last year introduced labor-market legislation known as the Jobs Act (in English, mysteriously). It makes hiring and firing easier, but only in the private sector. For state jobs, like Checco\xe2\x80\x99s, things stay the same. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re in, you\xe2\x80\x99re in.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not all. In the public sector, pensions and perks are protected by trade unions, with military efficiency. But private-sector unions are steadily losing ground. As a result, most young Italians who enter the private-sector job market face many hurdles. Only a small percentage find employment at job centers or hiring halls; most succeed through personal connections. Pay is lower than in Northern Europe. German engineers, for example, make 30 percent more than their Italian counterparts.'b'And the overall number of private-sector jobs is still far too few. In the last two years, according to the European Central Bank, 2.16 million jobs were created in the eurozone: 724,000 in Spain, 592,000 in Germany, but only 127,000 in Italy. And of these, almost two-thirds are part time. Unemployment in Germany is 6.3 percent; in Italy it\xe2\x80\x99s going down, but is still high at 11.3 percent. And only 15.1 percent of Italians between 15 and 24 have a job at all, against 43.8 percent in Germany.'b'And so, even as Mr. Renzi and the Italian media celebrate the private sector, many Italians are longing for the security of the dull but solid life of the government clerk. The region of Umbria expects 32,000 people from across the country to apply for the 94 clerical jobs it will soon open in its local government offices.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no coincidence that people are lining up to watch \xe2\x80\x9cQuo Vado.\xe2\x80\x9d Why cry, when you can laugh?'b'Raqqa, Syria \xe2\x80\x94 A FEW weeks ago, my friend Saeed tried to get his family out of Raqqa, the city in eastern 'b'Syria'b' that since 2014 has been the de facto capital of the self-declared Islamic State. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s becoming very hard to get any kind of work in Raqqa,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. He was depressed that he\xe2\x80\x99d failed in his attempt to smuggle his family over the Turkish border to the north.'b'I talk to Saeed almost every time he has a phone connection. He was one of the thousands who\xe2\x80\x99d fled the fighting around Aleppo in northwestern Syria in 2012. I met him when he was searching for a house to rent in Raqqa.'b'Although the city was besieged by rebels from the Free Syrian Army, as well as from Islamist groups like the Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, back then it was a safe haven compared with embattled cities like Aleppo, Homs and Deir Ezzor. Raqqa was soon crowded with refugees. But in 2013, as the rebel groups closed in and the Syrian Air Force of President 'b'Bashar al-Assad'b' started bombing the city, those who could afford to started to leave.'b'For me, Raqqa was my hometown and leaving was out of the question. Even under bombardment, people managed to keep their businesses running. I worked two jobs.'b'In January 2014, the Nusra Front and other rebel groups started a campaign to drive the Islamic State out of Syria. But after a two-week battle, the Islamic State 'b'captured'b' Raqqa \xe2\x80\x94 a strategic city for the jihadist group, which originated in Iraq.'b'By then, most government operations were closed. Those lucky enough to work in departments that were still functioning, like electricity and health, risked their lives to pick up their salaries, traveling nearly 100 miles to a government-held part of Deir Ezzor. Others lost their livelihood.'b'Some traders grew relatively rich, as did workers in Raqqa\xe2\x80\x99s primitive oil refineries. But many people turned to subsistence farming to support their families, even educated people like Abdulrahman, an engineer and family friend.'b'Abdulrahman didn\xe2\x80\x99t invite the Islamic State to his town. He used to work for the Department of Finance, had his own apartment and a nice car. Now he makes a meager living growing vegetables, as his father once did.'b'Few people are like Abdulrahman, preferring to stay no matter what. The majority are stuck, like Saeed, in the \xe2\x80\x9ccapital\xe2\x80\x9d of the Islamic State \xe2\x80\x94 which has also become, of course, the No. 1 'b'target 'b'for airstrikes by the American-led coalition.'b'Many Raqqa residents face an additional problem: keeping their sons from being sucked into the fighting. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen first hand that for Raqqa\xe2\x80\x99s teenagers, the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s ideology has zero appeal. What they want is its money and its guns.'b'Not counting bonuses, a fighter starts out earning about $200 a month \xe2\x80\x94 more than a family needs to live (a civilian like Saeed struggles to make $150). He gets additional money for wives, children, slaves and provisions, raising his potential monthly income to more than $500. If he applies for a house, the Islamic State will hand him the keys within two months.'b'These young men want to be listened to when they speak, and feared. These motives \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9crespect,\xe2\x80\x9d cash and guns \xe2\x80\x94 are turning ordinary young people into murderers.'b'There were rumors last year that the Islamic State was going to start drafting Raqqans. They soon came true. Near the front line where the Islamic State is fighting the Kurdish People\xe2\x80\x99s Protection Units, or Y.P.G., the jihadists have already conscripted one man from every family. They claim it\xe2\x80\x99s so they can \xe2\x80\x9cdefend their villages.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Raqqa, news that the Y.P.G. and its Free Syrian Army allies are preparing for an assault on the city is causing trepidation. It would be the third battle for Raqqa in two years. And the more the Islamic State is pushed out of other territories and back toward Raqqa, the more it leans on the locals here. In addition to conscription, the Islamists are confiscating houses and levying new taxes.'b'Meanwhile, the aerial bombardment continues practically every night. When the American-led coalition airstrikes targeted the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters for the first time, in 2014, people were excited. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s different. Every so often, we hear that a drone strike has killed an Islamic State commander, but there\xe2\x80\x99s no sign that the group has been significantly weakened.'b'The Islamic State is still here, and the bombs just bring fear and misery to civilians. Indeed, the very people being victimized by the Islamic State are also being bombed by its enemies.'b'No one believes aerial bombing alone can bring a solution. Not Russian airstrikes, anyway. The Russians, just like the Assad forces, do not distinguish between civilians and jihadist fighters.'b'Until the Islamic State is rooted out, the local community will remain tied to the jihadist group in one way or another, because it is the power on the ground. Raqqa is seen by many as the Islamic State\xe2\x80\x99s stronghold and a recruiting base. But those people living under Islamic State rule are the ones suffering the most from its brutality.'b'The diversity of Syrian society has been destroyed, and minorities are persecuted. Virtually every day, people are whipped or executed in the streets, accused of violating 'b'Shariah law'b' or of being spies. Earlier this month, a local journalist named Ruqia Hassan, who had disappeared several months earlier, was 'b'confirmed'b' dead, killed by Islamic State militants who accused her of spying for the F.S.A.'b'The Islamic State gives people one choice: Escape your poverty by fighting for us. The world has to offer people living under the Islamic State better choices. Stop the Assad government from bombing markets and bridges, and its Russian allies from bombing civilian infrastructure, as happened recently when a Russian airstrike 'b'reportedly'b' hit a water main, cutting off water for the entire city.'b'Most of all, don\xe2\x80\x99t dismiss as terrorists the citizens of occupied cities just because they were too poor to leave when the Islamic State took over. The people under this occupation present the best hope for destroying the jihadists. Without their support, the Islamic State can hardly be defeated.'b'BETWEEN Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s State of the Union address and Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s Republican debate, and with the primary season around the corner, this week may well mark \xe2\x80\x9cpeak spin\xe2\x80\x9d for the 2016 campaign. President Obama is making the case for his legacy, congressional Republicans are making the case against it, the candidates are puffing themselves up and tearing one another down, and the hired opinion mongers are blanketing us with spin of their own.'b'For many, this blizzard of January spin prompts a yearning for a more authentic politics, free of Washington cant. Yet all the distortion involved in modern spin, the thrust and parry of competing arguments are vital to democracy, and a big part of what gets us interested and engaged in the first place.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s worth recalling that the term \xe2\x80\x9cspin\xe2\x80\x9d is relatively new. Back in 1960, when the Kennedy-Nixon debates first aired, the campaigns didn\xe2\x80\x99t trot out any smooth-talking spokesmen afterward to explain why their man had won. But in the years that followed \xe2\x80\x94 the era of Lyndon B. Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccredibility gap\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the press began to chafe at passively relaying the president\xe2\x80\x99s messages. Journalists began insisting on offering readers and viewers more analysis, to the frustration of presidents like Richard M. Nixon who preferred to control the narrative.'b'Politicians learned that they had to get their own surrogates on the air, be they partisan journalists, hired flacks or abject toadies. With the Ford-Carter debates in 1976, the networks began showcasing these handpicked spokesmen. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a clear-cut victory for the president,\xe2\x80\x9d Ron Nessen, Gerald Ford\xe2\x80\x99s press secretary, told an NBC reporter after one debate. Robert S. Strauss, the Democratic Party chairman, called the same event \xe2\x80\x9ca good night for the American people and a great night for Jimmy Carter.\xe2\x80\x9d No one was fooled.'b'In 1984, the artificiality of these efforts had grown so transparent that the hired talkers were called \xe2\x80\x9cspin doctors.\xe2\x80\x9d By 1988 these cheerleaders were so numerous that journalists christened the corridor where they congregated Spin Alley (later upgraded to the Spin Room). One surrogate that fall for the Democratic nominee, Michael S. Dukakis, was a vanquished rival from the spring primaries; after a debate at the University of California, Los Angeles, Student Union, he gamely embraced his thankless sales job with uncommon zeal (or admirable self-awareness), donning a white hospital coat and a name tag to proclaim himself \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Albert Gore Jr.: Spin Doctor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The concept of spin quickly became a part of the culture. The next years produced the rock band the Spin Doctors, the political sitcom \xe2\x80\x9cSpin City\xe2\x80\x9d and the dryly comic documentary \xe2\x80\x9cSpin,\xe2\x80\x9d assembled from satellite feeds that captured politicians behind the scenes, unguarded, honing their messages for public consumption.'b'The word \xe2\x80\x9cspin\xe2\x80\x9d connotes something a little different from older names for persuasive speech. In the early 20th century, the term of choice, \xe2\x80\x9cpropaganda,\xe2\x80\x9d implied a passive citizenry manipulated by powerful politicians. In the 1950s and 1960s, \xe2\x80\x9cnews management,\xe2\x80\x9d an ungainly shard of Cold War bureaucratese, evoked presidents tightly controlling the spigot of information.'b'Spin, on the other hand, has an impish quality; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take itself too seriously. Spin winks at its own truth stretching. It signals to the journalists who report it and the audiences who consume it that they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a partial, even insincere, version of events. But it also suggests that this grazing of the truth is no grounds for alarm, because, after all, politics has never been the realm of dispassionate truth-telling.'b'The fact is, many of us enjoy the post-debate commentary. Confident that we can see through self-serving claims of the hacks and flacks, we question them, and even applaud those who voice our own sentiments. When politicians we like are foundering, we want them to be more skilled and aggressive with their spin, not less.'b'The whirlwind of spin this week also shows that, in a democracy, spin is almost always met with abundant counterspin. A lot of it may be vacuous, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not \xe2\x80\x94 despite our frustrations \xe2\x80\x94 in a totalitarian society of Orwellian Newspeak. When the president makes a glib argument, a host of conservative tweeters are ready to pounce; when the G.O.P. candidates harrumph windily, liberal critics delight in highlighting their evasions. Citizens intuitively grasp that we\xe2\x80\x99re not helpless dupes in the face of clever arguments or high-tech ads, though we may suspect our neighbors are.'b'In a time of cynicism, audiences need to find ways to take pleasure in politics. Democracy requires objective information for voters to make informed judgments. But it also needs lively argument. Spin, even when we\xe2\x80\x99re fully aware of its partisan nature and strategic purposes, leads us to argue and think about what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake in our politics.'b'The theatricality and combativeness on display in the Spin Room \xe2\x80\x94 and the animated chatter ricocheting across the TV studios and Twitter feeds \xe2\x80\x94 are more likely to pique citizens\xe2\x80\x99 political interest than are antiseptic or Olympian declarations that purport to tell us all we need to know.'b'Instead of trying to banish spin from the kingdom of politics, we\xe2\x80\x99d be better off nurturing in ourselves and our neighbors the critical sense that allows us to question and evaluate spin \xe2\x80\x94 and maybe, just once in a while, to know when to enjoy it.'b'President Obama showcased a Syrian immigrant, Refaai Hamo, during his State of the Union address as evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cour diversity and our openness,\xe2\x80\x9d qualities that have long defined and sustained the United States.'b'But given the degree of openness America has offered Syrian refugees over close to five years of war in which a quarter of a million people have been killed, this political choreography qualified as serious chutzpah.'b'Hamo, who lost his wife and daughter in the war, is one of about 2,500 refugees Washington has admitted since 2012. That\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 0.06 percent of the 4.4 million Syrians who have fled their country, most of them marooned in neighboring Middle Eastern states, many staggering into Europe.'b'In fact Hamo, in his relative isolation on this side of the Atlantic, might better have been offered as a symbol of the closing of the American mind \xe2\x80\x94 its post 9/11 susceptibility to fear of terrorism, its anxiety about downward social drift, its uncertainty about the future, its postwar fatigue, its plague-on-all-their-houses dismissal of the war-without-victory Middle East.'b'Obama tried to inject hope. That\xe2\x80\x99s where the world began with Obama. Yes, we could. In truth, after  seven years in the White House, he seemed weary himself, straining for conviction.'b'As the world knows by now, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s temperament is more inclined toward explanation than exhortation. The president is primed to out-reason the Islamic State \xe2\x80\x94 they want this, so we\xe2\x80\x99ll do that \xe2\x80\x94 as if reason even flirts with the outer galaxies of the Raqqa universe. When feeling does take over, as with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s passionate appeal this month for America to rein in its gun madness, the effect is particularly powerful because rare.'b'Republicans have sought to block Obama at every turn, not least on immigration, balking even at his plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees this year. The politics of anti-Muslim bigotry will not be far from the surface throughout this American election year.'b'For everyone \xe2\x80\x94 from Donald Trump to rightist parties in Germany and Sweden \xe2\x80\x94 itching to close borders, the sexual assaults on women in Cologne on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve have become the great I-told-you-so moment. Germany last year admitted 1.1 million refugees and asylum seekers, of whom close to 40 percent are Syrian. That\xe2\x80\x99s a huge number. Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s admission last year of up to 190,000 refugees is also substantial, relative to its population.'b'In small towns, when hundreds of newcomers abruptly arrive, social tensions are inevitable. Far-right forces \xe2\x80\x94 Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Pegida movement or the Sweden Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 believe they can benefit.'b'The refugee flow is unlikely to stop. Saudi Arabia just took a hatchet to already forlorn international peacemaking efforts through a mass execution that infuriated Iran. No peace is possible in Syria until the Saudis and Iranians both want it.'b'Still, I\xe2\x80\x99d bet on Germany and Sweden, societies that have absorbed substantial numbers of refugees in the past, to prove resilient, and the aging European countries most open to immigration to be the more dynamic over time. What happened in Cologne was vile. Chancellor Angela Merkel has rightly spoken of \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusting, criminal acts,\xe2\x80\x9d and responded by toughening laws. She should go further. As a woman who reached the pinnacle, addressing refugees who have fled Muslim countries where women are often demeaned, she is uniquely placed to address the direct relationship between successful societies and female dignity, freedom and independence.'b'Meanwhile, let\xe2\x80\x99s keep some perspective. Even the most aggressive estimate of the number of asylum seekers involved in the Cologne incidents still leaves more than 1,099,500 newly admitted refugees in Germany who had nothing to do with what happened.'b'Merkel has done the right thing. Where would Europe be today with 1.1 million desperate people trudging from closed border to closed border? The Western responsibility for the Syrian debacle is immense. Her decision, alone among leaders, implicitly acknowledges this fact. Germany, over the past quarter-century, has absorbed 16 million former East Germans and ushered them from the paranoid, subjugated mind-set of the Soviet imperium. Its large Turkish community is unevenly integrated, but ever better with the years. Germany will handle the current influx.'b'Immigration is a challenge but also a measure of the confidence of a society, its preparedness for self-renewal. That confidence is low in America right now. \xe2\x80\x9cThe dignity of a person is untouchable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 so begins Germany\xe2\x80\x99s postwar Constitution, with words drawn from bitter experience. Merkel has shown the conviction that this idea can eventually be absorbed by everyone now in Germany. She will be vindicated.'b'The United States, between the 1880\xe2\x80\x99s and 1924, admitted about 4 million Italian immigrants. As Leon Wieseltier, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, observed to me, \xe2\x80\x9cWe got Enrico Fermi, Frank Sinatra, Joe DiMaggio, Antonin Scalia \xe2\x80\x94 and Al Capone. Who in their right mind would suggest that the Italian immigration was not a great blessing for our country?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Call it the Capone Principle: Costs of immigration are outweighed by benefits.'b'Houston \xe2\x80\x94 THERE\xe2\x80\x99S something about comparing America\xe2\x80\x99s school food to the superior meals in other countries\xe2\x80\x99 schools that we seem to enjoy, in a masochistic sort of way.'b'The latest example is 'b'Michael Moore'b'\xe2\x80\x99s new documentary, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Where to Invade Next'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which opens nationwide next month. Mr. Moore visits a village in Normandy and finds schoolchildren eating scallops, lamb skewers and a cheese course. He tells us, astonishingly, that the chef \xe2\x80\x9cspends less per lunch than we do in our schools in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and ends the segment by showing French students and adults photos of the food served in a Boston high school. As they pore over the pictures in puzzlement and horror, we read subtitled comments like \xe2\x80\x9cSeriously, what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFrankly, that\xe2\x80\x99s not food.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That scene drew a lot of laughs, but as someone who has written about school food for almost six years, it made me want to scream in frustration. One might easily conclude from this segment that our students could have these same delicious meals, cooked from scratch, if only our school districts weren\xe2\x80\x99t cheap, mismanaged or somehow captive to the processed food industry. But the problem with America\xe2\x80\x99s school food has little to do with the schools themselves.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with money. The federal government provides a little over 'b'$3 per student per lunch'b', and school districts receive a smaller contribution from their state. But districts generally require their food departments to pay their own overhead, including electricity, accounting and trash collection. Most are left with a dollar and change for food \xe2\x80\x94 and no matter what Mr. Moore says, no one is buying scallops and lamb on that meager budget.'b'Contrast this with France, where meal prices are tied to family income and wealthy parents can pay around $7 per meal. Give that sum to an American school food services director and you may want to have tissues handy as he\xe2\x80\x99s likely to break down in incredulous tears.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s labor and infrastructure. We criticize schools\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on highly processed, heat-\xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99-eat food, but cooking from scratch requires adequate cold storage and food preparation facilities, as well as trained workers. Since 2009, the federal government has 'b'provided around $200 million'b' for school kitchen improvements, but in 2014 the Pew Charitable Trusts 'b'showed'b' that schools\xe2\x80\x99 total needs exceed $5 billion. And even if a kitchen is fully outfitted for cooking, the cost of hiring skilled cooks can be prohibitive.'b'Given these considerable challenges, it isn\xe2\x80\x99t surprising that cooking from scratch is the exception in our country\xe2\x80\x99s schools. There are districts serving exemplary meals. But some are often either running a deficit or reliant on private philanthropy, which is hardly a model on which we can rely nationwide.'b'And what about the students on the other side of the serving line? Nothing in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s food environment primes them to embrace fresh, healthful school meals. 'b'The top four sources'b' of calories in the average American child\xe2\x80\x99s diet are grain-based desserts, pizza, soda and sports drinks, and bread. 'b'One-third'b' eat fast food every single day. 'b'More than 90 percent'b' don\xe2\x80\x99t eat enough vegetables. And each year, our children are bombarded by 'b'around $2 billion'b' in child-directed food and beverage advertising, much of which promotes the least healthy products.'b'Ideally, of course, the cafeteria would be a classroom in which to counter these unhealthy forces, but the fiscal survival of any school food program rests on student participation. When a director swaps out pizza for a wholesome sandwich or serves salad instead of fries, she risks losing customers \xe2\x80\x94 to home-packed lunches, vending machine snacks or off-campus fast food \xe2\x80\x94 and running her program into the red. She also has to compete with the on-campus junk food that\xe2\x80\x99s sold to raise money for the band or football team, a practice limited by recent regulation but far from eradicated.'b'Contrast all this with France, where vending machines are banned on campus and even home-packed lunches are discouraged. French law requires that junk food ads bear a countermessage promoting healthful eating. And France takes its citizens\xe2\x80\x99 food literacy so seriously that it provides 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ctaste training\xe2\x80\x9d'b' in its schools.'b'America isn\xe2\x80\x99t France, of course, and we\xe2\x80\x99re unlikely to ever serve our schoolchildren roasted guinea fowl or a daily cheese course. But we\xe2\x80\x99re so far on the other end of the spectrum, it\xe2\x80\x99s laughable.'b'Case in point: This coming week, Congress is scheduled to take up the Child Nutrition Act, which every five years sets the funding for federal child nutrition programs, including school meals. Yet despite all the financial pressures school districts face, few expect the per-meal reimbursement rate to rise significantly.'b'School meals in other countries fascinate us because they reflect a society\xe2\x80\x99s true food culture, as well as its regard for its children. Here in America, schools are doing the best they can to meet the nutritional needs of millions of children every day, but unfortunately our society is unwilling to do what it takes to truly feed them well.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a Democratic debate Sunday night! The party honchos scheduled it in the middle of a three-day weekend, obviously in a bid to ensure maximum attention. The American public, perky from eight straight hours of football playoffs, will totally be in the mood for a serious policy dialogue.'b'So far, the Democratic encounters have been mildly informative but not riveting. We don\xe2\x80\x99t wait expectantly for Bernie Sanders to snap, \xe2\x80\x9cYou already had your chance, Hillary, and you blew it,\xe2\x80\x9d the way Chris Christie did to Marco Rubio in the Republican debate Thursday. But tensions are mounting.'b'Clinton and Sanders had generally been taking the high road. This is in part because they have a basic level of respect for each other. (It\xe2\x80\x99s very likely that they respect Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, too, although no one\xe2\x80\x99s keeping track.)'b'Also, there was a widespread feeling that the outcome was preordained. You cannot believe how gracious that can make people.'b'Now, it seems possible Sanders could stage an upset in Iowa and New Hampshire. Can you imagine what a Groundhog Day nightmare this is for Clinton? The uber-qualified woman who believes she knows how to make the real world better, stuck with another opponent promising transformational change. True, this one is a 74-year-old white guy. But still.'b'Until recently, Clinton attacked just the Republicans, while occasionally pointing out that Sanders has a very weak history when it comes to gun control. But as the polls got more and more scary, things escalated. This week she connected him \xe2\x80\x94 legislatively \xe2\x80\x94 to the Charleston church shooting and then suggested that his health care plan might endanger Medicare.'b'Not taking this lying down, Sanders \xe2\x80\xa6 made a negative ad.'b'I know, this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound heart-stopping. There\xe2\x80\x99s a Ted Cruz ad suggesting that while ISIS prepares to destroy America, Marco Rubio plays fantasy football. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s ad doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even mention Clinton by name.'b'Still, Hillary for America officials called a news conference to discuss the \xe2\x80\x9cSanders Attack Ad.\xe2\x80\x9d They pointed out the many, many times Sanders had said he\xe2\x80\x99d never go there. They quoted a campaign strategist boasting that Bernie \xe2\x80\x9drejects the status quo of politics. \xe2\x80\xa6 If we do a classic comparative ad, it\xe2\x80\x99s over.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is one of the problems with being Bernie Sanders. His whole point is to be outside the political norm. He\xe2\x80\x99s the principled maverick whose most famous moment in the Senate was his eight-and-a-half-hour speech against the compromises President Obama made in 2010 to get a tax deal. We expect him to stick to his standards, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re somewhat irrational.'b'Hillary is the former first lady who survived her husband\xe2\x80\x99s impeachment, became a senator, then lost a presidential bid and then became secretary of state. We expect more in the way of can-do and less in the way of elevated campaign tactics from her.'b'As negative ads go, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s is not exactly a body blow. Maybe a little soft poke. With one finger. While wearing mittens. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street,\xe2\x80\x9d he tells the camera. \xe2\x80\x9cOne says it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. to take millions from big banks and then tell them what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the attack part. Do you think Sanders is saying it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair to take money from big banks and then regulate the heck out of them? Or that you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take their money in the first place? Probably the latter, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly an attention-grabber when Republicans are running spots calling each other a \xe2\x80\x9cbully\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cjerk.\xe2\x80\x9d (Both of those were aimed at Donald Trump, and I believe I speak for much of the nation when I say, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Sanders has been stressing his war on Wall Street, but now Clinton is lacing out at his health care plan, which is basically universal Medicare. The details are vague. Although he has cheerfully explained how he wants to pay for free public college tuition (tax Wall Street speculators) and expand Social Security (stop capping the payroll tax), Sanders is mum on who\xe2\x80\x99ll pick up the health care bill. A staff member says they\xe2\x80\x99re still tinkering \xe2\x80\x9cwith the details.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s response, however, seemed wildly overblown. One of the first shots came from \xe2\x80\x94 of all people \xe2\x80\x94 Chelsea, who claimed that \xe2\x80\x9cSenator Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sanders wants to keep all those services in a different program. Except the private insurance. He does want that to go, and Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. An excellent topic for a discussion. Hillary, explain what\xe2\x80\x99s so great about health insurance companies. Bernie, tell us how you\xe2\x80\x99d get your grand plan through Congress.'b'They ought to be perfect debate partners. She has about as much detailed knowledge of the way American government works as anybody breathing. He has great dreams and the confidence that everything is possible. But it\xe2\x80\x99s harder for Clinton, who has to argue that everything\xe2\x80\x99s not.'b'The tumbling price of crude oil is helping many Americans save money. It also presents a good opportunity for state governments to raise their gasoline taxes to help pay for road repairs and other needed transportation investments.'b'Ideally, Congress should raise the national gasoline tax, which has remained at 18.4 cents per gallon since 1993. But federal lawmakers are so fearful of raising taxes just ahead of an election that they refuse to do so. The transportation bill they approved in December provides far too little money to repair and upgrade America\xe2\x80\x99s crumbling transportation system.'b'That leaves it up to the states to do the job. And now is the time to do it. The average price of gas was $1.99 a gallon in the week ended Jan. 11, down from $2.80 a gallon at the end of June, 'b'according to'b' the Energy Information Administration. That decrease gives state lawmakers plenty of room to raise taxes without hitting drivers with a big new expense.'b'Many states have already acted. Last year, eight states, including Iowa, Michigan and Washington, raised their gasoline taxes, 'b'according to'b' the National Conference of State Legislatures. Two others, Kentucky and North Carolina, changed the way that they tax fuel to make sure the revenue they collect does not decline as the price of gasoline fluctuates.'b'Other states have not stepped up. Among them is New Jersey, which 'b'taxes gasoline'b' at just 14.5 cents a gallon, a fraction of the tax rates in neighboring New York, which charges 42.64 cents a gallon, and Pennsylvania, which charges 50.04 cents.'b'As a result, New Jersey is 'b'falling behind'b' on needed repairs to its roads and bridges, and has been forced to raise fares for rail commuters. The state also needs to come up with money to help pay for its share of the cost of a new rail tunnel under the Hudson River that is expected to cost about $20 billion. The federal government and Amtrak will 'b'put up half'b' of that, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey have agreed to come up with the rest.'b'New Jersey\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance to raise taxes makes it harder for neighboring states to raise theirs, since some residents in New York and Pennsylvania will be even more tempted to cross state lines to fill up their tanks. Still, New York should certainly consider raising its gas tax to help pay for the many transportation projects Mr. Cuomo has announced in recent weeks, including the 'b'renovation of Penn Station'b', the 'b'addition of a track'b' to the Long Island Rail Road and improvements in the 'b'city\xe2\x80\x99s subway and bus system'b'.'b'The case for more transportation investment is very strong. Study after study finds that the country\xe2\x80\x99s roads, bridges and rail lines are 'b'inadequate and that 'b'public spending on transportation as a percentage of the gross domestic product has been 'b'stagnant for several decades'b'. More investment would not just improve roads and railways. It would also boost the economy by creating jobs and improving efficiency.'b'When Gov. Andrew Cuomo went to Mount Neboh Baptist Church in Harlem last Sunday to give a speech on criminal justice reform, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to go down in the history books as the governor who closed the most prisons in the history of the state of New York.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So far, he\xe2\x80\x99s right: 13 prisons 'b'have been closed'b' since he took office in 2011. That\xe2\x80\x99s an encouraging trend and a necessary part of the kind of broad criminal justice reform the state badly needs. It also reverses one of the worst legacies of his father, Gov. Mario Cuomo, who 'b'presided over'b' the biggest prison expansion in New York\xe2\x80\x99s history \xe2\x80\x94 30 new facilities with a total of nearly 30,000 beds.'b'The younger Mr. Cuomo has had his share of setbacks on the issue before, some of them self-inflicted, so it is heartening that he is trying again. In 2014, he 'b' quickly abandoned'b' a smart, popular proposal to finance college programs in state prisons after Republican lawmakers went berserk, mocking it as \xe2\x80\x9cAttica University.\xe2\x80\x9d And despite his 'b'repeated calls'b' to raise the age of adult criminal responsibility in New York to 18 from 16 \xe2\x80\x94 an embarrassing relic that exists in only one other state, North Carolina \xe2\x80\x94 he has not persuaded the Legislature to act.'b'Now Mr. Cuomo has introduced an ambitious slate of reforms, several of which he spoke about in his 'b'State of the State address'b' on Wednesday.'b'The most symbolic is his renewed commitment to educating prisoners. This should be an easy call, since research shows that education increases the chances of success upon release, which reduces recidivism and benefits public safety. This time, Mr. Cuomo worked around the Republicans by 'b'securing $7.5 million'b' from the huge bank-asset forfeiture fund controlled by the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., and doubling it with private matching funds.'b'The money will go to educating thousands of inmates over the next five years. And it is a good sign that the governor will not be defeated by lawmakers\xe2\x80\x99 stubborn refusal to listen to reason.'b'In his annual address, Mr. Cuomo also emphasized the value of keeping young people out of the criminal justice system in the first place. He proposed budgeting $100 million to convert failing schools into \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity schools,\xe2\x80\x9d which would provide a range of services including mentoring, health care referrals and opportunities for summer learning. He proposed that $55 million be spent to expand a job-training program to reach 10,000 more young New Yorkers from communities with high unemployment.'b'For those who do wind up behind bars, Mr. Cuomo wants to make it easier for them to get jobs after their release. In December he presented a plan to 'b'pardon up to 10,000 people'b' who were convicted of nonviolent crimes when they were 16 or 17 and who have had clean records for at least 10 years. Pardons can remove legal barriers to jobs and housing that prevent people from establishing a law-abiding life. And on Wednesday, he strengthened that by announcing that the state would no longer sell the criminal history information of pardoned people, which employers often use to reject job applications out of hand.'b'These are strong steps, and the governor deserves credit for pushing them. But he can do more.'b'For example, many inmates languish behind bars long after they are ready for release because the State Parole Board, which is made up entirely of Mr. Cuomo\xe2\x80\x99s appointees, 'b'focuses almost solely'b' on their original crimes and ignores their rehabilitation in prison.'b'Mr. Cuomo says the board should make parole interviews open to the public and explain in more detail the reasons for its decisions. He needs to let board members know that if they fail to do this, they should look for another job.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Trump and Cruz Exchange Taunts at G.O.P.

What is dismaying is that it is not simply a case of greedy officials harvesting illegal payments, like those in soccer\xe2\x80\x99s ruling body. In track and field, the officials\xe2\x80\x99 behavior directly undermined fair competition.'b'The report released Thursday was actually the second part of the findings of a yearlong investigation by an independent commission of the agency into allegations first made by a German public broadcaster of a state-sponsored doping program in Russia. The first part of the report, issued in November, focused on that program, which involved athletes, coaches, trainers, doctors and the secret services, and led to Russia\xe2\x80\x99s suspension from global competition.'b'The second installment of the report said that well before the international agency launched its investigation the track and field association knew the extent of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s involvement. Much of the report focused on Lamine Diack, the Senegalese who led the association until last year, who is under criminal investigation in France along with close aides and his two sons.'b'The association did the right thing in suspending Russia. The scandal taints all global competition. An aspiring young athlete who sees this kind of corruption could conclude that only doping offers a chance at victory.'b'The misconduct in track and field demonstrates that there is still considerable work to be done in international sports before doping ceases to be an option. The way to change that culture is to prosecute and punish officials who encourage and profit by it.'b'Hamburg \xe2\x80\x94 FOR all its horror, what happened on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve in Cologne and other German cities might help the Germans solve a longstanding problem. The issue is not the one-million-plus refugees who have come to us in the first place. It is how to deal with problems that immigrants might be, are or will be causing.'b'More than 650 criminal complaints have been filed by women in Cologne regarding that night, and more than 150 in Hamburg, including two cases of rape. A 28-year-old women named Katia said: \xe2\x80\x9cSuddenly I felt a hand on my bum, on my breasts, I was grabbed everywhere, it was horrific. I was desperate, it was like running the gantlet. Over the space of 200 meters, I think I must have been touched about 100 times.\xe2\x80\x9d Of the 50 suspects identified in Cologne, the bulk are from northern Africa, mostly from Morocco.'b'These are uncomfortable facts. And until now, Germans have struggled to find an appropriate, decent way to address the issues they raise, without being labeled a Nazi or a fool. At last, this is changing. If Willkommenskultur, the welcoming culture, was the word of the year for 2015, this year\xe2\x80\x99s leading candidate should be Ehrlichkeitskultur, the honesty culture. Cologne has been the catalyst: It shows that we must talk more frankly, yet not less responsibly, about immigration.'b'It is now up to Chancellor 'b'Angela Merkel'b' to transform the new soberness into action. She has already made corrections to her open-door policy, including a stricter deportation law for immigrants who commit crimes. But she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do even more, and she\xe2\x80\x99ll have to do it quickly.'b'The news about the Cologne attacks resembled a bomb going off in slow motion, and its effects have been absorbed just as slowly, in less of a panic than a controlled shock. First, the police in Cologne withheld information about the mass sexual assaults (the police chief later resigned). When the details started to emerge, journalists were reluctant to admit the mere possibility that refugees had been involved, although this was pretty obvious from various witness accounts early on.'b'All the while, the political left tried to play down the event. Claudia Roth, a Bundestag leader from the Green Party, compared the mass crimes in Cologne to the sexual harassments that she said happen every year at the Munich Oktoberfest (which police records show to be false). The head of the Central Council of Muslims in 'b'Germany'b' warned that it would be a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor mistake\xe2\x80\x9d to draw any conclusions about the cultural backgrounds of these men. If this sounds like ignorance and appeasement, it is.'b'In fact, the attacks do fit a pattern: According to the Cologne police, 40 percent of the city\xe2\x80\x99s immigrants from northern Africa become delinquent, mainly for theft, within their first year in Germany. Another problem, the police say, is that in order to avoid deportation, many asylum seekers from this region ditch their passports so that their home country is unknown.'b'The charge that economic immigrants are masquerading as refugees, long denied here \xe2\x80\x94 including by Ms. Merkel herself \xe2\x80\x94 is now painfully, undeniably true. And why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it be? If you\xe2\x80\x99re a 20-something Moroccan without any job prospects, and suddenly an airline ticket to Istanbul equals an entry ticket into Europe, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you take your chance?'b'The problem, as Cologne demonstrates, is that potentially thousands of these men are criminals, with no other aim than to rob and betray their hosts. This is despicable and unbearable.'b'Ms. Merkel should acknowledge that she underestimated this problem. The continuation of Willkommenskultur depends on her embracing an Ehrlichkeitskultur. In particular, she must do three things.'b'First, find a way to separate the free riders and criminals from the refugees. Thanks to the lack of identity checks at the borders in the past months, we just don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether many of those who have poured into Germany have done so for good reasons or bad. This has to be established now by all possible means, by taking fingerprints, photos and other personal information and exchanging them with authorities in the home countries.'b'Then we need to deport those who have no right to stay, quickly and visibly. The German government says that currently, 8,000 people from northern Africa, mostly from Morocco and Tunisia, are obliged to leave Germany, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t be sent back because their home countries won\xe2\x80\x99t accept them without papers. These countries need to be pressured into cooperation.'b'Finally, we have to be willing to intern those who arrive without passports. This sounds harsh, but it is appropriate. People who cross the border without ID must be prevented from roaming freely within Germany. Once in semi-custody (meaning that you cannot get into Germany, but you\xe2\x80\x99re free to go home), it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t take long to determine where they came from, and why.'b'The idea isn\xe2\x80\x99t new: Special sites for people from the Balkans who filed mostly pointless asylum requests after the fighting there were set up in Bavaria. This has reduced the influx from these countries considerably.'b'Ms. Merkel has said that right now, our country needs to draw on a new German pragmatism. Yes, but it also needs German thoroughness, not least for the sake of the real refugees who need our protection. Without a cleareyed Ehrlichkeitskultur that addresses real problems in a reasonable tone, we risk seeing it fall into the hands of the growing far right.'b'The latest nuclear test by North Korea earlier this month drew swift condemnation from the United Nations Security Council.'b'While the gun violence debate often focuses on mass shootings of strangers, 'b' hundreds of Americans'b' are fatally shot every year by spouses or partners. In 2013, 'b'61 percent of women'b' killed with guns were killed by husbands, ex-husbands or boyfriends. And in 57 percent of shootings in which four or more people were killed, one of the victims was the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s partner or family member, according to 'b'an analysis by the group Everytown for Gun Safety'b'.'b'Yet shortcomings in federal and state law allow many domestic abusers to have access to firearms, even after courts have determined that the abusers pose a threat to their partners.'b'Federal law prohibits anyone convicted of any felony, or of misdemeanor domestic violence against a spouse, from owning a gun. People subject to a domestic violence restraining order issued after a hearing (not a temporary order issued before a hearing can take place) are also prohibited from owning guns. But people convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors against partners with whom they never lived are not prohibited from owning guns under federal law, nor are those convicted of misdemeanor stalking. Senator Amy Klobuchar and Representatives Debbie Dingell and Robert Dold have introduced bills to close these loopholes, but the bills have gained little traction.'b'While a background check should prevent anyone prohibited from purchasing a firearm from doing so, federal law does not require private sellers to perform background checks. The results can be deadly: In 2012, a Wisconsin man subject to a domestic violence restraining order 'b'purchased a gun from a seller on the website ArmsList.com'b' and used it to kill his wife, two other women and himself. In her request for the restraining order, 'b'his wife had written'b', \xe2\x80\x9cHis threats terrorize my every waking moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'An 'b'effort to expand background-check requirements'b' to include all online and gun show sales failed in the Senate last month. Currently, 18 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on all handgun sales. Between 2008 and 2012, states that required background checks on private sales had 'b'46 percent fewer'b' gun homicides of women by partners, adjusted for population, than states with no such requirement.'b'But checks on new gun sales are only part of the solution; states and the federal government should also require that abusers surrender guns they already have. Currently, 15 states require people under domestic violence restraining orders to turn in their guns, and 10 states require those convicted of domestic violence misdemeanors to do so. But even in states with gun surrender laws on the books, enforcement is uneven.'b'Some states, like California and Connecticut, allow police to confiscate guns from someone who is determined by a court to be a threat to a partner, even if a domestic violence restraining order is not in place.'b'State and federal lawmakers need to follow the example of states that have closed loopholes and enacted surrender laws to prevent the dangerous from possessing deadly weapons.'b'The 'b'long slide in oil prices'b', which reached a 13-year low this week of less than $30 a barrel, means that oil-rich nations are not so rich anymore. And that is potentially a big problem for investors and policy makers in the United States and abroad.'b'Falling oil revenues will increase the need for Saudi Arabia and other oil producers to raise money, in part by selling investments they have made with their oil wealth. The more oil prices fall and the longer they stay low, the greater the risk that such sales will occur at a time when financial markets are already weakening, which would amplify the downward pull.'b'The sums involved are potentially huge. 'b'Most of the $7.2 trillion'b' in sovereign-wealth funds \xe2\x80\x94 financial portfolios owned by governments \xe2\x80\x94 is from nations that rely on oil and gas profits to sustain their economies and societies. From April through September last year, as oil prices fell from the high $50s to the low $40s a barrel, sovereign wealth funds pulled an estimated $100 billion from their investments, according to Morgan Stanley. At least half of that total was withdrawn by Saudi Arabia, according to The Financial Times. More recently, The Financial Times reported that prolonged low oil prices would empty the $64.2 billion sovereign fund of Kazakhstan within 10 years.'b'In October, the International Monetary Fund 'b'warned'b' that interest rates could be forced up if sovereign funds began to sell off their bond holdings. In December, an I.M.F. official told 'b'The Wall Street Journal'b' that asset sales by those funds against a backdrop of \xe2\x80\x9cliquidity concerns\xe2\x80\x9d could cause \xe2\x80\x9clarge price movements.\xe2\x80\x9d As it turns out, liquidity concerns \xe2\x80\x94 or worry about the ability to pull one\xe2\x80\x99s money out of an investment \xe2\x80\x94 have 'b'preoccupied investors'b' since last month, when a prominent hedge fund halted redemptions because it could not meet investors\xe2\x80\x99 demands to cash out.'b'Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil producers continue to push oil prices lower by flooding the world with cheap crude in an attempt to protect their market shares, even though they need much higher oil prices to sustain their nations.'b'Worse, those dynamics are unfolding without the transparency that investors and policy makers need. 'b'In recent years'b''b', 'b''b'multinational efforts 'b'by investor groups and government officials to create disclosure rules on the size, holdings and strategies of sovereign wealth funds have had limited success. In addition, American and foreign financial regulators recently opted not to impose heightened regulatory standards on BlackRock and other large asset managers that handle sovereign wealth, thus precluding the chance to monitor the funds by monitoring their managers.'b'As a result, no one can say with precision how much or when the markets could be affected by the investment moves of oil-producing nations. That uncertainty is a significant problem, and one of regulators\xe2\x80\x99 own making.'b'How does the death penalty in America end?'b'For decades that has been an abstract question. Now there may be an answer in 'b'the case of Shonda Walter'b', a 36-year-old black woman on Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s death row. On Friday, the Supreme Court met to discuss whether to hear a petition from Ms. Walter, who is asking the justices to rule that in all cases, including hers, the death penalty violates the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ban on cruel and unusual punishments.'b'Ever since 1976, when the court allowed executions to resume after a four-year moratorium, the abolition movement has 'b'avoided bringing'b' a broad constitutional challenge against the practice, believing that it would not succeed. In that time, 'b'1,423 people'b' have been put to death.'b'Yet there is no question that the national trend is moving away from capital punishment. Since the late 1990s, almost every year has seen fewer executions, fewer new death sentences and fewer states involved in the repugnant business of killing their citizens.'b'In 2015, there were 'b'28 executions and 49 new death sentences'b', the lowest numbers in decades. Seven states have abandoned the practice entirely since 2004, for a total of 19 that no longer have the death penalty. Many others have not executed anyone for years. And only three states \xe2\x80\x94 Texas, Georgia and Missouri \xe2\x80\x94 were responsible for almost all of last year\xe2\x80\x99s executions.'b'A majority of Americans still support capital punishment, but the percentage favoring it has dropped from around 80 percent in the 1990s 'b'to about 60 percent now'b'. When polls offer a choice between death and life without parole, people 'b'roughly'b' 'b'split'b' evenly.'b'In the past 14 years alone, the Supreme Court has barred the execution of several categories of people: 'b'minors'b', the 'b'intellectually disabled'b', and those convicted of 'b'a crime other than murder'b'. In that last case, decided in 2008, Justice Anthony Kennedy 'b'wrote'b' for the court, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the law punishes by death, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Taken together, these signs have led 'b'some abolitionists'b' to conclude that the conditions for ending capital punishment entirely are now as favorable as they might ever be. That argument got a major boost last June, when Justice Stephen Breyer, in a long dissent from a 'b'5-to-4 ruling'b' that allowed Oklahoma to proceed with its inhumane lethal-injection drug protocol, 'b'suggested'b' he would be open to a case challenging the constitutionality of the death penalty itself.'b'In his dissent, which was joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Breyer explained in detail how the death penalty was unreliable, arbitrary and racially discriminatory. He said it was no longer sufficient simply \xe2\x80\x9cto patch up the death penalty\xe2\x80\x99s legal wounds one at a time,\xe2\x80\x9d because the practice as a whole \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely\xe2\x80\x9d violates the Eighth Amendment.'b'Shonda Walter\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'case'b' is the first to take up Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s challenge. Ms. Walter was convicted of murdering an 83-year-old man named James Sementelli. Her appointed lawyers put on no defense and offered no argument that might have spared her from a death sentence. Pennsylvania appeals courts agreed that she had inexcusably bad representation, but they still upheld her conviction and sentence. Since Ms. Walter does not fit the special categories of defendants who are shielded from the death penalty, her appeal is based on the claim that all executions violate the Constitution.'b'The justices may not grant Ms. Walter\xe2\x80\x99s petition (others are also 'b'expected to be filed'b' in the coming weeks), but they can no longer ignore the clear movement of history. They already have all the evidence they need to join the rest of the civilized world and end the death penalty once and for all.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 AFTER running as a man last time around, Hillary Clinton is now running as a woman.'b'Matthew Dowd, the former W. strategist who became an independent, says Hillary got it backward: She should have run as a woman in 2008, when she was beating back a feminized antiwar candidate. And she should have run as a man this time, when Americans feel beleaguered and scared and yearn for something \xe2\x80\x9cbig and masculine and strong,\xe2\x80\x9d as Dowd put it.'b'Despite the deafening dearth of excitement among younger women, Hillary has cast herself as Groundbreaking Granny.'b'She\xe2\x80\x99s campaigning with Lena Dunham, Katy Perry and Demi Lovato and is selling T-shirt pantsuits on her website.

Hillary shared the childhood woe of being told by boys in her neighborhood that she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t play with them because she was a girl.'b'She told Rachel Maddow she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t rule out an all-estrogen ticket by choosing a female running mate.'b'A group of women in the Senate \xe2\x80\x94 most of whom deserted Hillary for Barack Obama in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 descended on Iowa on Friday in the spirit of sisterhood.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s this element of women getting to where they are by working harder and being accountable,\xe2\x80\x9d Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told me on the eve of their swing. \xe2\x80\x9cRight now, Americans are demanding that politicians be accountable because they\xe2\x80\x99re tired of all the bull going on.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And Hillary told the Time reporter Jay Newton-Small for a new book, \xe2\x80\x9cBroad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works,\xe2\x80\x9d that she would govern differently as the first female president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just think women in general are better listeners, are more collegial, more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for win-win outcomes,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary said.'b'Of course, if she had been a better listener on her health care initiative and the Iraq invasion, those two towering issues might not have scuppered her.'b'It always sounds nice to say that women are more collegial and empathetic and helpful to other women and that they see the big picture more clearly, and sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s true. But sometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s not \xe2\x80\x94 especially with hard-boiled alpha women trying to break gender barriers.'b'Look at Carly Fiorina\xe2\x80\x99s crash at Hewlett-Packard.'b'Since we cannot know if a woman is going to overcompensate on machismo \xe2\x80\x94 as Hillary did on the unjustified Iraq invasion \xe2\x80\x94 we may want to look at it a different way.'b'It may be more relevant to ask if someone is a cat or a dog.'b'The feline Barack Obama began his aloof reign wanting to prowl alone on the stage and he\xe2\x80\x99s ending it the same way. His State of the Union speech was an exercise in thumbing his nose at the noxious obstructionist Republicans, and lecturing Americans \xe2\x80\x94 who have gone from strong and silent to weak and chatty \xe2\x80\x94 to grow up about ISIS and stop acting as though World War III has broken out.'b'The hyper-rational President Obama, who disdains easy emotion in politics, has had a hard time offering comfort or capturing the public mood at moments when people don\xe2\x80\x99t feel safe, from the Christmas underwear bomber to the BP oil spill to the rise of ISIS.'b'Juliette Kayyem, his former assistant secretary for Homeland Security, said it\xe2\x80\x99s important to try to soothe people\xe2\x80\x99s fears by calmly explaining exactly what is being done to protect them.'b'The author of the forthcoming \xe2\x80\x9cSecurity Mom\xe2\x80\x9d warned Democratic senators to take Americans\xe2\x80\x99 unease seriously when she spoke at the senators\xe2\x80\x99 retreat at Nationals Park last week.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOtherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Republican paranoia, the craziness and hysteria of \xe2\x80\x98It\xe2\x80\x99s the Muslims\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Just keep them out,\xe2\x80\x99 fills the vacuum.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She cited a recent 'b'Wall Street Journal story'b' suggesting that Republicans may get a boost from \xe2\x80\x9csecurity moms,\xe2\x80\x9d women who moved toward the Republican Party after 9/11 and who have gotten jittery again after the spate of ISIS attacks. The story noted that only 35 percent of women in a CNN/ORC International poll from December approved of the president\xe2\x80\x99s performance on terrorism, compared with 64 percent who disapproved.'b'You can paint the fear of ISIS as overblown and irrational, as Obama suggested to columnists at the White House and in his State of the Union speech, but that\xe2\x80\x99s the wrong approach, Kayyem said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can say someone is more likely to die in a car this weekend than from a terrorist attack,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut people are feeling it and you can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore that fear.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'W. was all about the gut and Obama is all about the head and now Donald Trump is soaring by being the opposite of Obama, all about the gut again.'b'Both Hillary and Trump have been emphasizing that they will do a lot more schmoozing with lawmakers and others who disagree with them, vowing to be dogs with a bone, eager canines offering paws, and not a cool cat stalking away at the first sign of difficulty or when affection is most desired.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to build those relationships and constantly be looking for common ground no matter how small a sliver it may be,\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary told The Des Moines Register on Monday.'b'At a town hall talk in Iowa on Friday, Trump made it clear that he would not be as scornful of wheeling, dealing and wheedling as Obama.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou get them in a room and you say \xe2\x80\x98Do it,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said about working on a budget with Congress. \xe2\x80\x9cObama doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get anyone in a room.

Cajole!\xe2\x80\x9d Trump exclaimed.'b'Have you ever seen a cat cajole?'b'QATAR, it seems, was gazumped.'b'Sheikh Jassim bin Abdulaziz al-Thani of Qatar 'b'thought he\xe2\x80\x99d bought a Picasso masterpiece 'b'in November 2014. That was when he agreed, through his agents, to pay $42 million for the spectacular \xe2\x80\x9cBust of a Woman (Marie-Th\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa8se).\xe2\x80\x9d The seller was Picasso\xe2\x80\x99s daughter Maya Widmaier-Picasso, who was parting with a much-loved object.'b'But the sheikh never got his Picasso. After he had made the first two of three payments, his agents received a letter canceling the sale and refunding the money. The sculpture now anchors the magnificent \xe2\x80\x9cPicasso Sculpture\xe2\x80\x9d show at the Museum of Modern Art, with a label saying, \xe2\x80\x9cCourtesy Gagosian Gallery.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Larry Gagosian'b', the gallery\xe2\x80\x99s owner, says he bought the piece in May 2015 for $105.8 million; he then sold it to an unidentified New York collector.'b'The financial term for this kind of thing is \xe2\x80\x9c'b'phantom liquidity'b'\xe2\x80\x9d: It\xe2\x80\x99s the name for when you think you\xe2\x80\x99ve bought something, but then it turns out that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t. Or, on the other side of the deal, it\xe2\x80\x99s called seller\xe2\x80\x99s remorse.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the feeling you get when you sell something and then find out that the thing you sold is worth much more than you sold it for. It\xe2\x80\x99s natural to want to unsell the object and then resell it at its market price. In Britain, for instance, sellers can agree to part with a house for a certain price, but then change their mind and accept a higher offer at the last minute \xe2\x80\x94 a phenomenon known as \xe2\x80\x9cgazumping.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The secretive art market is almost purpose-built for such disputes. (Mr. Gagosian, for example, claims that he had no knowledge of the prior deal when he bought the Picasso.) Art is often bought by offshore trusts, stored in tax havens, and passed through long chains of intermediaries. In the art world, information is money, especially information about who owns what. And if you don\xe2\x80\x99t know who the principals in any deal might be, it\xe2\x80\x99s much harder to go after them for breach of contract.'b'There are surely many reasons for Mr. Gagosian to be coy about the identity of the owner of the Picasso, not least that the owner probably has no desire whatsoever to be identified. Mr. Gagosian is probably furious in any case that legal proceedings over his purchase have forced him to reveal the amount he paid for the sculpture. The less everybody else knows about how he operates and who his clients are, the more valuable he can be to those clients.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s possible that this entire dispute could end up with an unambiguously positive outcome. Never mind the squillionaires squaring off against one another here \xe2\x80\x94 the Picasso family, the Qatari royal family, Mr. Gagosian, his secret client. All of them are going to be just fine.'b''b'My'b' big hope is that the Qataris will persuade a New York court to hand down an injunction preventing MoMA from returning the sculpture to Mr. Gagosian, pending resolution of the various lawsuits. Given the number of lawyers involved in France, Switzerland and New York, the dispute could drag on for years. In which case the whole world will get to enjoy this wonderful sculpture for much longer than MoMA intended when it asked to borrow the piece.'b'An icon of 20th-century sculpture, \xe2\x80\x9cBust of a Woman\xe2\x80\x9d is already in its natural, perfect home. Long may lawyers keep it there.'b'SHORTLY after his exit from an abbreviated presidential run last fall, 'b'Gov. Scott Walker'b' of Wisconsin returned to a more successful undertaking: dismantling what remains of his state\xe2\x80\x99s century-old progressive legacy.'b'Last month, Mr. Walker signed a bill that allowed corporations to donate directly to political parties. On the same day, he signed a law that replaced the state\xe2\x80\x99s nonpartisan Government Accountability Board, a body that is responsible for election oversight and enforcing ethics codes, with two commissions made up of partisan appointees. Now a new bill supported by Mr. Walker, which is expected to clear the Republican-dominated Legislature with a Senate vote soon, threatens to corrupt Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Service.'b'In 1905, Wisconsin became the third state to enact Civil Service reform, helping establish it as a national model for clean government. The reforms were one of the many achievements of Gov. Robert M. La Follette Sr., who later founded the Progressive Party and ran for president on its ticket. But Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s new Civil Service bill replaces anonymous exams with r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s, opening the door to political or racial bias that would prove almost impossible to detect because personnel files are not part of the public record.'b'The bill lengthens the probationary period for new employees, during which they can be fired for any reason (or no reason). And it centralizes hiring within the Department of Administration, the most politicized agency in the state\xe2\x80\x99s government. Incoming r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s would be judged by one of the governor\xe2\x80\x99s appointees.'b'Besides rewriting the hiring process for new employees and the work rules that govern some 30,000 current state workers, the bill highlights Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s role as a laboratory for a national conservative strategy to destroy the labor movement. That experiment began in 2011 with the passage of Act 10, which all but ended collective bargaining for the state\xe2\x80\x99s public employees and helped inspire more than a hundred bills across the country attacking public-sector unions.'b'Last year, Mr. Walker signed a \xe2\x80\x9cright-to-work\xe2\x80\x9d law that weakened private-sector unions and also marked a significant national turning point: Half of the 50 states are now right-to-work. A national right-to-work bill, which already has 18 co-sponsors in the Senate, including Senator Ted Cruz, appears increasingly possible under a Republican president.'b'By adding the Civil Service bill, Mr. Walker brings Wisconsin closer to the achievement of a long-sought goal of the libertarian right: universal \xe2\x80\x9cat-will employment.\xe2\x80\x9d Unlike union workers or state employees, whose collective bargaining agreements or Civil Service rules generally require employers to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9cjust cause\xe2\x80\x9d for them to be fired, at-will employees can be terminated at any time for any reason. At-will employment is promoted by the Heritage Foundation and American Legislative Exchange Council, which disseminates model bills to state legislators benefiting its corporate members and conservative private backers.'b'When Scott Walker was an assemblyman and ALEC member in the 1990s, according to the Center for Media and Democracy, a Madison-based watchdog group focused on corporate influence in government, ALEC adopted a bill called the At-Will Employment Act for state legislators to use as a template. In the past 20 years, many states, including Tennessee, Indiana, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Kansas have eroded job-security protections for Civil Service workers, mirroring key aspects of ALEC\xe2\x80\x99s model.'b'ALEC\xe2\x80\x99s role was more explicit in 2011, when Jan Brewer, the former governor of Arizona, gave a keynote address at an ALEC conference indicating she would \xe2\x80\x9creform\xe2\x80\x9d her state\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Service. Several months later, she signed a bill (introduced in the Legislature by an ALEC member) that closely tracked with ALEC\xe2\x80\x99s model and stripped Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s state workers of virtually all Civil Service protections.'b'The Civil Service bill Mr. Walker supports also undermines protections against unfair termination. Under its rules, supervisors could fire workers for \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal conduct\xe2\x80\x9d they find \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate, unsuitable or inferior.\xe2\x80\x9d Like many of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s opponents, Jim Thiel, a retired chief attorney for the state\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Transportation, fears such vague language invites partisan retaliation and favoritism. \xe2\x80\x9cThese words \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x98inadequate,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98inferior\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 are empty vessels into which you can pour many things,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Thiel told me. \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98Personal conduct\xe2\x80\x99 sounds like something outside the work environment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Walker administration\xe2\x80\x99s record of retribution gives credence to Mr. Thiel\xe2\x80\x99s fears. In 2013, Mr. Walker abruptly withdrew the nomination of a student representative to the University of Wisconsin System\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Regents after discovering that the nominee had signed a petition calling for the governor\xe2\x80\x99s recall. (Two local Tea Party groups have created a searchable database of the one million recall signatures.) In July, Mr. Walker eliminated a third of the Department of Natural Resources\xe2\x80\x99 staff scientists, whose research on climate change, wildlife management and pollution from a proposed iron ore mine offered a compelling rebuke to his industry-driven environmental agenda.'b'Many public policy experts believe that Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Service system would benefit from modernizing reforms, as it did in the 1990s under Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson. Mr. Thompson enacted changes recommended by a bipartisan commission of legislators that held public hearings across the state and also included representatives of employee unions. But like Act 10 and the right-to-work law, the new Civil Service bill was drawn up in secret, announced with little warning, and contained no meaningful input from affected parties. The Senate and Assembly granted a single day each of perfunctory hearings.'b'During the protests over Act 10, as Mr. Walker demonized public employee unions, he praised private sector ones, only to betray them later by enacting right-to-work. The Civil Service bill uses a similar tactic. In 2011, Mr. Walker assured state workers that they did not need their unions because of Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s Civil Service rules. \xe2\x80\x9cIn Wisconsin, the rights that most workers have have been set through the Civil Service system, which predates collective bargaining by several generations,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change. All the Civil Service protections \xe2\x80\x94 the strongest Civil Service system in the country \xe2\x80\x94 still strongly remains intact.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s reversal, coupled with other divisive new measures like undermining tenure in the University of Wisconsin System, have contributed to his 38 percent approval rating in the state. They also suggest that his ambition may still be to win national office. In an October interview with a conservative Milwaukee talk radio host, he did not rule out another run. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful we have a Republican president for the next eight years after this election, but after that we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to see what the future holds,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Walker said. In December, Senator Cruz encouraged his supporters to relieve Mr. Walker of his campaign debt, generating speculation that he might become the vice-presidential choice for the like-minded Mr. Cruz.'b'The people least surprised by Mr. Walker\xe2\x80\x99s reversal were the state\xe2\x80\x99s beleaguered workers. A longtime Wisconsin civil servant told me that she worries about the security of her job if the bill becomes law. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re an at-will employer, you can just tell someone goodbye,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, noting that 72 state employees in Arizona had recently been fired indiscriminately.'b'Despite the long odds of stopping the measure after the failure of large protests against Act 10 and the right-to-work law, the woman quietly helped organize a teach-in last week to raise awareness about the bill. As she talked about her efforts, however, it became clear that a culture of fear had taken root in the Wisconsin workplace. Though she describes herself as a \xe2\x80\x9clabor activist,\xe2\x80\x9d when I asked if I could use her name she declined. She was too afraid.'b'IN 2014 Matt Bai published a book called \xe2\x80\x9cAll the Truth Is Out,\xe2\x80\x9d a history of Gary Hart\xe2\x80\x99s scandal-driven downfall that doubled as a lament for political journalism\xe2\x80\x99s surrender to the lure of tabloid culture.'b'Bai\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'book'b' was a great read, and nobody would dispute his point that there\xe2\x80\x99s far less privacy for politicians than in the days when Lyndon Johnson could tell a group of reporters: \xe2\x80\x9cYou may see me coming in and out of a few women\xe2\x80\x99s bedrooms while I am in the White House, but just remember, that is none of your business.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But his book\xe2\x80\x99s title was still a little bit misleading. Even today, we don\xe2\x80\x99t get 'b'all'b' the truth about the sex lives of the powerful and famous. We get more of it than people got in the 1960s, but it still often comes in fragments, glimpses, rumor and conjecture.'b'You can read a thousand supermarket stories, for instance, without getting any closer to the truth about most Hollywood relationships. And while the mainstream press isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily protective of public figures, neither is it rushing out to do National Enquirer-style digging whenever there\xe2\x80\x99s a plausible rumor in the wind. For every Eliot Spitzer or Mark Sanford, there\xe2\x80\x99s a scandalous story that flares and vanishes 'b'amid a lot of journalistic discomfort'b' about touching it.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also a certain randomness to when a scandal actually breaks big. To take a nonpolitical example, Bill Cosby\xe2\x80\x99s sexual exploitations were kinda-sorta in the public record for years and years, but they were a footnote in profiles and biographies until Hannibal Buress starting talking about Cosby-the-rapist in his comedy routines. Then suddenly, it was a story, a cascade of stories, and the whole truth or something close was out.'b'Similarly, in the political realm, The National Enquirer first published John Edwards-Rielle Hunter stories in October of 2007. But Edwards was able to make his way through an entire primary campaign before the mainstream media finally, reluctantly, started reporting on his love child.'b'Which brings us to Bill Clinton, whose old scandals are once more in the news \xe2\x80\x94 because Donald Trump is talking about them, because Juanita Broaddrick took to Twitter to reassert her claim that Clinton raped her in 1978, and because today\xe2\x80\x99s liberal deference toward rape victims makes an uneasy fit with how the Clinton camp dealt with accusations from Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey and Paula Jones in the 1990s.'b'This has produced a lot of discussion about whether the former president\xe2\x80\x99s sexual past is \xe2\x80\x9cfair game\xe2\x80\x9d during his wife\xe2\x80\x99s 2016 campaign. But that question tends to assume that there\xe2\x80\x99s some consensus about the former president\xe2\x80\x99s sexual past. It assumes that all the truth is out.'b'In reality, though, 'b'the narrative around Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s sexual past'b' is highly unstable, with several variations that have a plausible claim on being true.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s the official Clintonite narrative, in which the former president strayed with Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky, was forgiven by his wife and daughter, and deserves to have his repentance respected.'b'Then there\xe2\x80\x99s the narrative that I suspect most Americans believe, in which the former president was much more of a tomcat in Arkansas, and probably has tomcatted occasionally in his post-presidency \xe2\x80\x94 but always consensually, and lately in ways that have minimized exposure or embarrassment.'b'If either of these narratives are true, then Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s sex life will be a non-issue in 2016. If an adulterer, even a frequent adulterer, is all he is, then an America that didn\xe2\x80\x99t want him impeached in the 1990s isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to object to having him as the First Gentlemen today.'b'But suppose you believe the Broaddrick story. Liberals dismissed it during the impeachment days, but if you read the summary of the case from the (mostly liberal) Dylan Matthews at the (mostly liberal) website 'b'Vox'b', this dismissal looks unfair. There\xe2\x80\x99s an inescapable he-said/she-said dynamic, but one need not be a \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve all rape allegations\xe2\x80\x9d absolutist to find her claim persuasive.'b'If she\xe2\x80\x99s telling the truth, then Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s sexual past becomes something more predatory. The slippage between a powerful man\xe2\x80\x99s dalliances and straightforward predation is something that 'b'could'b' happen just once. But looked at in the light of a credible rape allegation, there are all sorts of Clinton stories \xe2\x80\x94 the Willey and Jones cases, the rumors collected by Jones\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers, the old tales of state troopers being used as procurers, the 2002 globetrotting on the jet of a billionaire who\xe2\x80\x99s also a convicted statutory rapist \xe2\x80\x94 that could suggest a darker pattern, tending toward the Cosby-esque.'b'The truth about Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s past, then, is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t actually know the truth. And even in our tabloid-driven age, it\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that we simply never will.'b'But if the question is, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes Bill\xe2\x80\x99s past matter for Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s campaign?,\xe2\x80\x9d the answer depends less on what we know right now than on what might be waiting to come out.'b'LAST fall, as student activists around the country protested racism on their campuses, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas 'b'dismissed'b' secular universities as havens for \xe2\x80\x9cleftist, coddled kids.\xe2\x80\x9d The protests proved that these schools teem with \xe2\x80\x9cpsychotic Marxists,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'declared'b' \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daily Caller,\xe2\x80\x9d a conservative website.'b'When conservative Christians map the culture wars, they cast secular universities to the far left periphery \xe2\x80\x94 the region that medieval cartographers would have marked \xe2\x80\x9chere be dragons.\xe2\x80\x9d A cottage industry of books with titles like \xe2\x80\x9c'b'How to Stay Christian in College'b'\xe2\x80\x9d has long warned pious 18-year-olds that college is a place where the \xe2\x80\x9cPrince of Deception\xe2\x80\x9d will set \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual snares.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'American evangelicals have a venerable tradition of painting the ivory tower as the bastion of unbelief and leftist ideology. As mainstream culture becomes more diverse and moves further away from traditional Christian teachings on matters like sexuality, we might expect evangelical students on elite secular campuses to feel more embattled than ever. Yet that\xe2\x80\x99s not what I found when I spoke to a range of students and recent graduates.'b'Contrary to conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 warnings about the oppressive secularism of the modern university, these students have taken advantage of their campuses\xe2\x80\x99 multicultural marketplace of ideas. They have created a network of organizations and journals that engage non-Christian ideologies head-on. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that many schools\xe2\x80\x99 nondiscrimination policies have made life more difficult for Christian ministries that require student leaders to assent to a statement of faith. But some students have seized on this challenge as an opportunity.'b'Since 2010, when the Supreme Court upheld a policy at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law that requires student groups to accept all students regardless of their beliefs, several universities have 'b'stripped'b' InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and other Christian groups of their status as recognized campus organizations. At Vanderbilt, Bowdoin and other schools, the groups lost access to campus space, student fees and activity fairs \xe2\x80\x94 on the grounds that requiring student leaders to affirm a statement of faith violated the schools\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9call comers\xe2\x80\x9d policy. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat our students have said is that it\xe2\x80\x99s clear the administration doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want us here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Greg Jao, InterVarsity\xe2\x80\x99s director of campus engagement.'b'Yet 'b'some'b' evangelicals have poured their energies into a different sort of Christian organization, one that has been proliferating quietly for decades at universities around the country: Christian study centers. These are not ministries, exactly, and what they do is not old-fashioned evangelism. Typically they occupy private buildings off campus and exist independently from the university, beyond the reach of nondiscrimination policies. The first study centers appeared in the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s, but their numbers have mushroomed since 2000. The Consortium of Christian Study Centers 'b'counts'b' 20 members \xe2\x80\x94 a small but significant number considering that many are embedded in the most prestigious universities around the country.'b'The centers position themselves as forums where students can hash out the tensions between their faith and the assumptions of secular academia \xe2\x80\x94 the same assumptions that have assailed more traditional ministries. They are, in a sense, spiritual \xe2\x80\x9csafe spaces\xe2\x80\x9d that offer cozy 'b'libraries'b', reading groups and public lectures, and sometimes advertise their ethos with names that honor Christian intellectuals who embraced the life of the mind (Chesterton House at Cornell is named for the English writer and lay theologian; Rivendell Institute at Yale evokes the world of J.R.R. Tolkien\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLord of the Rings\xe2\x80\x9d trilogy, which many Christians read as a subtle tribute to its author\xe2\x80\x99s faith).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe overall message is that the Christian faith is a viable thing in the world we live in, that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to live faithfully and think hard about whatever topic we\xe2\x80\x99re discussing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jay McCabe, a staff member at the Center for Christian Study at the University of Virginia.'b'Undergraduate journals of Christian thought, publications like the Harvard Ichthus and The Logos at Yale, have also multiplied on elite campuses in recent years. When Andrew Schuman arrived at Dartmouth in 2006, he and some like-minded freshmen founded Apologia, a semiannual journal that 'b'aims'b' \xe2\x80\x9cto think critically, question honestly, and link arms with anyone who searches for truth and authenticity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of students who weren\xe2\x80\x99t Christian were excited by its appearance,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Schuman told me. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of us have spiritual questions, but we\xe2\x80\x99re uncertain how to ask them. The journal draws on a millennia-old tradition of faith and reason to give a vocabulary for those questions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The staff and students involved in these study centers and journals position themselves not as evangelists, but as conveners of a conversation meant to grapple with the ideological divides that secular liberalism\xe2\x80\x99s mantra of tolerance so often elides: How do people with clashing assumptions about what is real and good communicate and coexist?'b'To Philip Jeffery, a junior at Columbia, this question is at the heart of the recent wave of student activism \xe2\x80\x94 although he says older observers rarely seem to understand. \xe2\x80\x9cI keep seeing these articles about \xe2\x80\x98coddling,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you ask the question, what are the assumptions about human nature that are driving these things, you realize it\xe2\x80\x99s more than people wanting a safe space to talk about trigger warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Jeffery has tried to bring those conflicting assumptions to the surface of campus debate through Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Christian journal Crown &amp; Cross as well as his work for the Veritas Forum, an international organization that sponsors Christian speakers and interfaith dialogue on college campuses.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing you\xe2\x80\x99ll run into with any of the campus activists that I\xe2\x80\x99ve encountered is this idea that human nature is a collection of identity categories, that I as a human being am composed of a gender identity, a sexual identity, a racial identity and so forth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir perception of Christians, or of religious people more generally, is: \xe2\x80\x98O.K., these are people who have this one identity category, religion, and the religion they identify as is overstepping its bounds. It\xe2\x80\x99s telling my gender or sexual identity how to act.\xe2\x80\x99 The Christian response has to be: There\xe2\x80\x99s something more to what a human being is than just these collective attributes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most of the young evangelicals I spoke to had sympathy for the protests, and some had participated themselves. Today\xe2\x80\x99s evangelical students are all over the political map. Christian groups are often among the most racially diverse on campus \xe2\x80\x94 38 percent of InterVarsity members are nonwhite (another 14 percent are international students), and many local chapters are racially mixed. But they question the premises of secular identity politics, which they say is the lens that some university administrators mistakenly apply to religion.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVanderbilt didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand religious groups,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tish Harrison Warren, who worked for InterVarsity at Vanderbilt before events there led her to relocate to the University of Texas. \xe2\x80\x9cThey wanted to make us social groups, like fraternities who weirdly talk about Jesus, or service groups, or groups for the academic study of religion. But there is a proclamatory function. We are proclaiming a message to others.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIdentity politics\xe2\x80\x9d is shorthand for the left\xe2\x80\x99s effort to empower oppressed groups by elevating the authority of their experience as women, queer people or visible minorities. These identities are inborn or socially constructed (or both), depending on what kind of liberal you ask. But they often come with a tacit agreement to refrain from all but the most anodyne universal truth claims: to each identity her own.'b'Many religions \xe2\x80\x94 especially evangelical Christianity, which has a penchant for truth claims \xe2\x80\x94 are an awkward fit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re realizing that the future of the university has to lie with something like a principled pluralism. Exactly how to do that? I don\xe2\x80\x99t think we\xe2\x80\x99ve quite nailed it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Schuman said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can role model civil dialogue that\xe2\x80\x99s gracious and loving but recognizes differences,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Hobbet, the Veritas Forum\xe2\x80\x99s executive director. \xe2\x80\x9cStudents very rarely see professors, people they look up to, fundamentally disagreeing with each other on big important questions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Few liberals have openly confronted the big important questions raised by the InterVarsity episode: Do secular universities have any business supporting religious groups? How should they accommodate freedom of expression for those who condemn homosexuality or otherwise dissent from liberal values? As evangelical students have watched the penalization of Christian ministries on the basis of policies, like 'b'Vanderbilt\xe2\x80\x99s'b', that explicitly include religion among the categories protected from discrimination, they have witnessed firsthand the contradictions and ambiguities of liberal ideology.'b'Today many evangelical leaders are fond of proclaiming American Christians\xe2\x80\x99 new status as a 'b'moral minority'b', but these students and campus ministers are the ones who are actually living that reality. It has prodded them to seek serious conversation about humans\xe2\x80\x99 profound disagreements over morality and the nature of truth \xe2\x80\x94 questions that campus liberals, despite their professed concern for dialogue and critical thinking, often avoid in the name of tolerance and inclusion.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe think it\xe2\x80\x99s more constructive to talk about differences,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Jeffery. Minority status sometimes has a funny way of turning people into more thoughtful critics of the culture around them.'b'FOR those of us who argue in favor of gun safety laws, there are a few inconvenient facts.'b'We liberals are sometimes glib about equating guns and danger. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s complicated: The number of guns in America has increased by more than 50 percent since 1993, and in that same period the gun homicide rate in the United States has dropped by half.'b'Then there are the policies that liberals fought for, starting with the assault weapons ban. A 'b'113-page study'b' found no clear indication that it reduced shooting deaths for the 10 years it was in effect. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the ban was poorly drafted, and because even before the ban, assault weapons accounted for only 2 percent of guns used in crimes.'b'Move on to open-carry and conceal-carry laws: With some 'b'13 million Americans now licensed'b' to pack a concealed gun, many liberals expected gun battles to be erupting all around us. In fact, the most rigorous analysis suggests that all these gun permits caused neither a drop in crime (as conservatives had predicted) nor a spike in killings (as liberals had expected). Liberals were closer to the truth, for the increase in carrying loaded guns does appear to have led to more aggravated assaults with guns, but the fears were overblown.'b'One of the puzzles of American politics is that most voters want gun regulation, but Congress resists. One poll found that 74 percent 'b'even of N.R.A. members'b' favor universal background checks to acquire a gun. Likewise, the 'b'latest New York Times poll'b' found that 62 percent of Americans approved of President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s executive actions on guns this month.'b'So why does nothing get done? One reason is that liberals often inadvertently antagonize gun owners and empower the National Rifle Association by coming across as supercilious, condescending and spectacularly uninformed about the guns they propose to regulate. A classic of gun ignorance: New York passed a law three years ago banning gun magazines holding more than seven bullets \xe2\x80\x94 'b'without realizing'b' that for most guns there is no such thing as a magazine for seven bullets or less.'b'And every time liberals speak blithely about banning guns, they boost the N.R.A. Let\xe2\x80\x99s also banish the term \xe2\x80\x9cgun control\xe2\x80\x9d: the better expression is \xe2\x80\x9cgun safety.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet this, too, must be said: Americans are absolutely right to be outraged at the toll of guns. Just since 1970, 'b'more Americans have died'b' from guns than all the Americans who died in wars going back to the American Revolution (about 1.45 million vs. 1.4 million). That gun toll includes suicides, murders and accidents, and these days it amounts to 92 bodies a day.'b'We spend billions of dollars tackling terrorism, which killed 229 Americans worldwide from 2005 through 2014, according to the State Department. In the same 10 years, including suicides, some 310,000 Americans 'b'died from guns'b'.'b'So of course we should try to reduce this carnage. But we need a new strategy, a public health approach that treats guns as we do cars \xe2\x80\x94 taking evidence-based steps to make them safer. That seems to be what President Obama is trying to do.'b'Research suggests that the most important practical step would be to keep guns away from high-risk individuals, such as criminals, those who abuse alcohol, or those who beat up their domestic partners.'b'That means universal background checks before somebody acquires a gun. 'b'New Harvard research'b' confirms a long-ago finding that 40 percent of firearms in the United States are acquired without a background check. That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. Why empower criminals to arm themselves?'b'Some evidence supports steps that seem common sense. 'b'More than 10 percent 'b' of murders in the United States, for example, are by intimate partners. The riskiest moment is often after a violent breakup when a woman has won a restraining order against her ex. Prohibiting the subjects of those restraining orders from possessing a gun reduces these murders by 10 percent, one study found.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can keep a gun from someone at that moment of threat, that is very important,\xe2\x80\x9d notes Daniel W. Webster, a gun safety expert at Johns Hopkins University who has pioneered research on keeping guns from high-risk individuals.'b'Some public health approaches to reducing gun violence have nothing to do with guns. Researchers find that a nonprofit called'b' Cure Violence'b', which works with gangs, 'b'curbs gun deaths'b'. An initiative called Fast Track supports high-risk children and 'b'reduces delinquency'b' and adult crime.'b'In short, let\xe2\x80\x99s get smarter. Let\xe2\x80\x99s make America\xe2\x80\x99s gun battles less ideological and more driven by evidence of what works. If the left can drop the sanctimony, and the right can drop the obstructionism, if instead of wrestling with each other we can grapple with the evidence, we can save thousands of lives a year.'b'IF your very candidacy and identity rest on your supposed talent for victory, can you survive a defeat?'b'Can you continue to call yourself a winner if you\xe2\x80\x99ve been a loser \xe2\x80\x94 and if \xe2\x80\x9closer\xe2\x80\x9d is your favorite way of closing the book on someone, your final word, the workhorse in your brimming lexicon of slurs, exiting your mouth so reflexively that it\xe2\x80\x99s essentially your exhalation, your carbon dioxide: \xe2\x80\x9closer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9closer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9closer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Donald Trump has a problem that the other candidates for the Republican nomination don\xe2\x80\x99t. He\xe2\x80\x99s put an obstacle in his path that they haven\xe2\x80\x99t. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t merely assert dominance. He claims something close to omnipotence. (Remember that laughable 'b'physician\xe2\x80\x99s report'b'?)'b'Neither his image nor his ego leaves any room for a setback, any allowance for second place. And as Iowa draws near and several polls suggest the strong possibility that Ted Cruz will finish ahead of him there, it\xe2\x80\x99s time to talk about what that would mean for a self-enamored emperor who pretty much insists on his own perfection \xe2\x80\x94 and who has built his brand on it.'b'At that point, Trump would no longer be a brilliant exception to the laws of political gravity. He\xe2\x80\x99d be someone whose lax management of his Iowa operation was laid bare, whose basic competence was in dispute. He\xe2\x80\x99d be one of many exhausted soldiers, girding himself for a muddy slog. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the path he plotted, the myth he\xe2\x80\x99s selling. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how he\xe2\x80\x99s rigged.'b'Other candidates can rack up a few disappointments. They haven\xe2\x80\x99t made their cases by pointing to their percentages, their ratings, their crowds. They don\xe2\x80\x99t draw such a sharp, unforgiving line between winners and losers. They don\xe2\x80\x99t equate being on top with being the best.'b'Trump does. Incessantly. It\xe2\x80\x99s his worldview, his philosophy, his morality, his tautology.'b'He\xe2\x80\x99s inverted the usual political logic. Typically, candidates cite their qualifications as the reason that voters should affirm them. Trump asserts that he\xe2\x80\x99s qualified 'b'because 'b'voters have affirmed him, or at least because they seem poised to.'b'Challenged on his policies (which don\xe2\x80\x99t really exist) or his credentials (which are dubiously applicable to the presidency), he whips out his poll numbers as proof of his worthiness. Sometimes he whips them out just for fun. And as he holds them high, he makes the argument that he 'b'must'b' have good ideas, good sense and good preparation. After all, he\xe2\x80\x99s winning!'b'But by that reasoning, losing wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be just a fluke, just a failure of the body politic to recognize and reward majesty when they behold it. No, it would be evidence that he\xe2\x80\x99s inferior or at least unexceptional. It would destroy the brand\xe2\x80\x99s foundation.'b'His bid for the presidency is all triumphalism, all superlatives. It rejects any humility. It forbids any humbling \xe2\x80\x94 especially the first time that voting becomes actual instead of theoretical and Iowans crown a champ.'b'When he kicked off his campaign from the gilded throne of Trump Tower last June, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t merely say that he\xe2\x80\x99d create jobs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created,\xe2\x80\x9d he decreed, emphasizing a divine patrimony.'b'On the day when he and his hair move into the White House, \xe2\x80\x9cunbelievable\xe2\x80\x9d blessings will rain down on this parched land of ours. He will be \xe2\x80\x9cthe best thing that ever happened to women,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe best security president.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And did you know that he has \xe2\x80\x9cthe world\xe2\x80\x99s greatest memory,\xe2\x80\x9d by his own estimation?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s one thing everyone agrees on,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, which is wrong, because many of us at The Times don\xe2\x80\x99t agree at all, especially not after the most recent Republican debate, on Thursday night. He was asked then about his proposal, made during a recent meeting with the newspaper\xe2\x80\x99s editorial board, for a 45 percent tax on Chinese goods brought into this country. And his magic powers of recollection eluded him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s The New York Times. They are always wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Except we weren\xe2\x80\x99t, not about this. A transcript and an audio recording of the meeting unequivocally demonstrate as much.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re probably losers anyway. That\xe2\x80\x99s the designation he assigns to anyone who fails to genuflect in his presence.'b'He has meted it out promiscuously \xe2\x80\x94 and diversely. The megastar Cher is a \xe2\x80\x9closer.\xe2\x80\x9d So are the mogul Mark Cuban, the basketball player Chris Jackson, the war hero John McCain.'b'The ranks of talk show hosts, journalists, pundits and political consultants are especially robust with losers, including Ana Navarro, Bill Maher and Karl Rove, who\xe2\x80\x99s not just a \xe2\x80\x9closer\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cdopey\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal fool,\xe2\x80\x9d as Trump tweeted. His 'b'testy Twitter feed'b' is his Hall of Shame. It\xe2\x80\x99s where the losers are rounded up and publicly flogged.'b'And his go-to arguments for why someone is a loser, a dope or a dummy is that he or she has made erroneous predictions or been repudiated by the ratings, the marketplace, the audience. A television personality is a loser if not all that many viewers tune in.'b'So what if not all that many Iowans turn out for Trump? What if, at the least, more of them choose Cruz? How can Trump dismiss the precise kind of judgment and measurement with which 'b'he 'b'dismisses everyone else?'b'Lately he\xe2\x80\x99s started to hedge, alternating prophecies that he\xe2\x80\x99ll win Iowa with statements that he hopes to. It\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ca little too close for comfort,\xe2\x80\x9d he told voters in Cedar Falls last week. I\xe2\x80\x99ll say.'b'For other candidates a loss is a part of the process, a prompt for self-examination, a cause for a reset and maybe an embarrassment. For Trump it\xe2\x80\x99s an existential crisis. Who is he if he can\xe2\x80\x99t look down on all of his rivals? What does he become if he has to look up to one of them, especially if the one is a natural-born irritant like Cruz?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cComeback kid\xe2\x80\x9d won\xe2\x80\x99t fit Trump. It\xe2\x80\x99s a middle seat in coach for a titan with his own planes \xe2\x80\x94 plural. (His own helicopters, too.) If he\xe2\x80\x99s wedged into it, he\xe2\x80\x99ll come unglued. I mean, more than he already has.'b'When he 'b'appeared'b' on the late-night talk show \xe2\x80\x9cJimmy Kimmel Live\xe2\x80\x9d last month, Kimmel teased him by claiming to have written a children\xe2\x80\x99s book for Trump. Its title? \xe2\x80\x9cWinners Aren\xe2\x80\x99t Losers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is my point, and this is Trump\xe2\x80\x99s pickle. If Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s voters don\xe2\x80\x99t swoon for him, it erases the whole gaudy prelude to that moment. He ceases to be the best, the most, the greatest. Trump will have been trumped, which means he\xe2\x80\x99s not the same Trump at all.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99M a climate scientist who has just been told I have Stage 4 pancreatic cancer.'b'This diagnosis puts me in an interesting position. I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent much of my professional life thinking about the science of 'b'climate change'b', which is best viewed through a multidecadal lens. At some level I was sure that, even at my present age of 60, I would live to see the most critical part of the problem, and its possible solutions, play out in my lifetime. Now that my personal horizon has been steeply foreshortened, I was forced to decide how to spend my remaining time. Was continuing to think about climate change worth the bother?'b'After handling the immediate business associated with the medical news \xe2\x80\x94 informing family, friends, work; tidying up some finances; putting out stacks of unread New York Times Book Reviews to recycle; and throwing a large \xe2\x80\x9cLimited Edition\xe2\x80\x9d holiday party, complete with butlers, I had some time to sit at my kitchen table and draw up the bucket list.'b'Very quickly, I found out that I had no desire to jostle with wealthy tourists on Mount Everest, or fight for some yardage on a beautiful and exclusive beach, or all those other things one toys with on a boring January afternoon. Instead, I concluded that all I really wanted to do was spend more time with the people I know and love, and get back to my office as quickly as possible.'b'I work for 'b'NASA'b', managing a large group of expert scientists doing research on the whole 'b'Earth'b' system (I should mention that the views in this article are my own, not NASA\xe2\x80\x99s). This involves studies of climate and weather using space-based observations and powerful computer models. These models describe how the planet works, and what can happen as we pump carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The work is complex, exacting, highly relevant and fascinating.'b'Last year was the warmest year on record, by far. I think that future generations will look back on 2015 as an important but not decisive year in the struggle to align politics and policy with science. This is an incredibly hard thing to do. On the science side, there has been a steady accumulation of evidence over the last 15 years that climate change is real and that its trajectory could lead us to a very uncomfortable, if not dangerous, place. On the policy side, the just-concluded climate conference in Paris set a goal of holding the increase in the global average temperature to 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels.'b'While many have mocked this accord as being toothless and unenforceable, it is noteworthy that the policy makers settled on a number that is based on the best science available and is within the predictive capability of our computer models.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that we\xe2\x80\x99ll hold the line at 2 degrees Celsius, but we need to give it our best shot. With scenarios that exceed that target, we are talking about enormous changes in global precipitation and temperature patterns, huge impacts on water and food security, and significant sea level rise. As the predicted temperature rises, model uncertainty grows, increasing the likelihood of unforeseen, disastrous events.'b'All this as the world\xe2\x80\x99s population is expected to crest at around 9.5 billion by 2050 from the current seven billion. Pope Francis and a think tank of retired military officers have drawn roughly the same conclusion from computer model predictions: The worst impacts will be felt by the world\xe2\x80\x99s poorest, who are already under immense stress and have meager resources to help them adapt to the changes. They will see themselves as innocent victims of the developed world\xe2\x80\x99s excesses. Looking back, the causes of the 1789 French Revolution are not a mystery to historians; looking forward, the pressure cooker for increased radicalism, of all flavors, and conflict could get hotter along with the global temperature.'b'Last year may also be seen in hindsight as the year of the Death of Denial. Globally speaking, most policy makers now trust the scientific evidence and predictions, even as they grapple with ways to respond to the problem. And most Americans \xe2\x80\x94 70 percent, according to a recent 'b'Monmouth University poll'b' \xe2\x80\x94 believe that the climate is changing. So perhaps now we can move on to the really hard part of this whole business.'b'The initial heavy lifting will have to be done by policy makers. I feel for them. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to take a tough stand on an important but long-term issue in the face of so many near-term problems, amid worries that reducing emissions will weaken our global economic position and fears that other countries may cheat on their emissions targets.'b'Where science can help is to keep track of changes in the Earth system \xe2\x80\x94 this is a research and monitoring job, led by NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and their counterparts elsewhere in the world \xe2\x80\x94 and use our increasingly powerful computer models to explore possible futures associated with proposed policies. The models will help us decide which approaches are practicable, trading off near-term impacts to the economy against longer-term impacts to the climate.'b'Ultimately, though, it will be up to the engineers and industrialists of the world to save us. They must come up with the new technologies and the means of implementing them. The technical and organizational challenges of solving the problems of clean energy generation, storage and distribution are enormous, and they must be solved within a few decades with minimum disruption to the global economy. This will likely entail a major switch to nuclear, solar and other renewable power, with an electrification of our transport system to the maximum extent possible. These engineers and industrialists are fully up to the job, given the right incentives and investments. You have only to look at what they achieved during World War II: American technology and production catapulted over what would have taken decades to do under ordinary conditions and presented us with a world in 1945 that was completely different from the late 1930s.'b'What should the rest of us do? Two things come to mind. First, we should brace for change. It is inevitable. It will appear in changes to the climate and to the way we generate and use energy. Second, we should be prepared to absorb these with appropriate sang-froid. Some will be difficult to deal with, like rising seas, but many others could be positive. New technologies have a way of bettering our lives in ways we cannot anticipate. There is no convincing, demonstrated reason to believe that our evolving future will be worse than our present, assuming careful management of the challenges and risks. History is replete with examples of us humans getting out of tight spots. The winners tended to be realistic, pragmatic and flexible; the losers were often in denial of the threat.'b'As for me, I\xe2\x80\x99ve no complaints. I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful for the experiences I\xe2\x80\x99ve had on this planet. As an astronaut I spacewalked 220 miles above the Earth. Floating alongside the International Space Station, I watched hurricanes cartwheel across oceans, the Amazon snake its way to the sea through a brilliant green carpet of forest, and gigantic nighttime thunderstorms flash and flare for hundreds of miles along the Equator. From this God\xe2\x80\x99s-eye-view, I saw how fragile and infinitely precious the Earth is. I\xe2\x80\x99m hopeful for its future.'b'And so, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to work tomorrow.'b'NORMALLY, I would have finished this column weeks ago. But I kept putting it off because my New Year\xe2\x80\x99s resolution is to procrastinate more.'b'I guess I owe you an explanation. Sooner or later.'b'We think of procrastination as a curse. Over 80 percent of college students are 'b'plagued'b' by procrastination, requiring epic all-nighters to finish papers and prepare for tests. Roughly 20 percent of adults 'b'report'b' being chronic procrastinators. We can only guess how much higher the estimate would be if more of them got around to filling out the survey.'b'But while procrastination is a vice for productivity, I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned \xe2\x80\x94 against my natural inclinations \xe2\x80\x94 that it\xe2\x80\x99s a virtue for creativity.'b'For years, I believed that anything worth doing was worth doing early. In graduate school I submitted my dissertation two years in advance. In college, I wrote my papers weeks early and finished my thesis four months before the due date. My roommates joked that I had a productive form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Psychologists have coined a term for my condition: 'b'pre-crastination'b'.'b'Pre-crastination is the urge to start a task immediately and finish it as soon as possible. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a serious pre-crastinator, progress is like oxygen and postponement is agony. When a flurry of emails land in your inbox and you don\xe2\x80\x99t answer them instantly, you feel as if your life is spinning out of control. When you have a speech to give next month, each day you don\xe2\x80\x99t work on it brings a creeping sense of emptiness, like a dementor is sucking the joy from the air around you (look it up \xe2\x80\x94 now!).'b'In college, my idea of a productive day was to start writing at 7 a.m. and not leave my chair until dinnertime. I was chasing \xe2\x80\x9c'b'flow'b',\xe2\x80\x9d the mental state described by the psychologist 'b'Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi'b' in which you are so completely absorbed in a task that you lose a sense of time and place. I fell so deeply into that zone of concentration that my roommates once gave a party while I was writing and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even notice.'b'But procrastinators, as the writer Tim Urban describes it on the blog 'b'Wait But Why'b', are at the mercy of an Instant Gratification Monkey who inhabits their brains, constantly asking questions like \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would we ever use a computer for work when the Internet is sitting right there waiting to be played with?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a procrastinator, overcoming that monkey can require herculean amounts of willpower. But a pre-crastinator may need equal willpower to 'b'not 'b'work.'b'A few years ago, though, one of my most creative students, Jihae Shin, questioned my expeditious habits. She told me her most original ideas came to her after she procrastinated. I challenged her to prove it. She got access to a couple of companies, surveyed people on how often they procrastinated, and asked their supervisors to rate their creativity. Procrastinators earned significantly higher creativity scores than pre-crastinators like me.'b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t convinced. So Jihae, now a professor at the University of Wisconsin, designed some experiments. She asked people to come up with new business ideas. Some were randomly assigned to start right away. Others were given five minutes to first play Minesweeper or Solitaire. Everyone submitted their ideas, and independent raters rated how original they were. The procrastinators\xe2\x80\x99 ideas were 28 percent more creative.'b'Minesweeper is awesome, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the driver of the effect. When people played games before being told about the task, there was no increase in creativity. It was only when they first learned about the task and then put it off that they considered more novel ideas. It turned out that procrastination encouraged divergent thinking.'b'Our first ideas, after all, are 'b'usually'b' our most conventional. My senior thesis in college ended up replicating a bunch of existing ideas instead of introducing new ones. When you procrastinate, you\xe2\x80\x99re more likely to let your mind wander. That gives you a better chance of stumbling onto the unusual and spotting unexpected patterns. Nearly a century ago, the psychologist Bluma Zeigarnik found that people had a 'b'better memory'b' for incomplete tasks than for complete ones. When we finish a project, we file it away. But when it\xe2\x80\x99s in limbo, it stays active in our minds.'b'Begrudgingly, I acknowledged that procrastination might help with everyday creativity. But monumental achievements are a different story, right?'b'Wrong. Steve Jobs procrastinated constantly, several of his collaborators have told me. Bill Clinton has been 'b'described'b' as a \xe2\x80\x9cchronic procrastinator\xe2\x80\x9d who waits until the last minute to revise his speeches. Frank Lloyd Wright spent almost a year procrastinating on a commission, to the point that his patron drove out and insisted that he produce a drawing on the spot. It became Fallingwater, his masterpiece. Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter behind \xe2\x80\x9cSteve Jobs\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe West Wing,\xe2\x80\x9d is known to put off writing until the last minute. When Katie Couric asked him about it, he 'b'replied'b', \xe2\x80\x9cYou call it procrastination, I call it thinking.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So what if creativity happens not in spite of procrastination, but because of it? I decided to give it a try. The good news is that I am no stranger to self-discipline. So I woke up one morning and wrote a to-do list for procrastinating more. Then I set out to achieve the goal of not making progress toward my goals. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t go excellently.'b'My first step was to delay creative tasks, starting with this article. I resisted the temptation to sit down and start typing, and instead waited. While procrastinating (i.e., thinking), I remembered an article I had read months earlier on pre-crastination. It dawned on me that I could use my own experiences as a pre-crastinator to set the stage for readers.'b'Next, I drew some inspiration from George Costanza on \xe2\x80\x9cSeinfeld,\xe2\x80\x9d who made it a habit to 'b'quit on a high note'b'. When I started writing a sentence that felt good, I stopped in the middle of it and walked away. When I returned to writing later that day, I was able to pick up where I had left the trail of thought. Mitch Albom, author of \xe2\x80\x9cTuesdays With Morrie,\xe2\x80\x9d uses the same trick. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you quit in the middle of a sentence, that\xe2\x80\x99s just great,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'told me'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get back to it the next morning.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Once I did finish a draft, I put it away for three weeks. When I came back to it, I had enough distance to wonder, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat kind of idiot wrote this garbage?\xe2\x80\x9d and rewrote most of it. To my surprise, I had some fresh material at my disposal: During those three weeks, for example, a colleague had mentioned the fact that Mr. Sorkin was an avid procrastinator.'b'What I discovered was that in every creative project, there are moments that require thinking more laterally and, yes, more slowly. My natural need to finish early was a way of shutting down complicating thoughts that sent me whirling in new directions. I was avoiding the pain of divergent thinking \xe2\x80\x94 but I was also missing out on its rewards.'b'Of course, procrastination can go too far. Jihae randomly assigned a third group of people to wait until the last minute to begin their project. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t as creative either. They had to rush to implement the easiest idea instead of working out a novel one.'b'To curb that kind of destructive procrastination, science offers some useful guidance. First, imagine yourself failing spectacularly, and the ensuing frenzy of anxiety 'b'may jump-start'b' your engine. Second, lower your standards for what counts as 'b'progress'b', and you will be less paralyzed by perfectionism. Carving out small windows of time can help, too: The psychologist Robert Boice helped graduate students 'b'overcome writer\xe2\x80\x99s block'b' by teaching them to write for 15 minutes a day. My favorite step is 'b'pre-commitment'b': If you\xe2\x80\x99re passionate about gun control, go to the app 'b'stickK'b' and fork over some cash in advance. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t meet your deadline, your money will be donated to the National Rifle Association. The fear of supporting a cause you despise can be a powerful motivator.'b'But if you\xe2\x80\x99re a procrastinator, next time you\xe2\x80\x99re wallowing in the'b' dark playground of guilt and self-hatred'b' over your failure to start a task, remember that the right kind of procrastination might make you more creative. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re a pre-crastinator like me, it may be worth mastering the discipline of forcing yourself to procrastinate. You can\xe2\x80\x99t be afraid of leaving your work un'b'Rocco Casagrande, a former United Nations biological weapons inspector, is managing director of 'b'Gryphon Scientific'b', a consulting company that last week delivered a federally commissioned report identifying the risks and benefits of allowing research that could make certain viruses, like influenza, SARS or MERS, more dangerous.'b''b'READING'b' Of course, there\xe2\x80\x99s reading for work. The report we just delivered has 2,979 references just on the footnotes page. But I recently read two sci-fi books from the 'b'Laundry Files series'b' by Charles Stross. They were sort of a cross between 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHitchhikers Guide\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe X-Files.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' This inspired me to read the collected weird tales of H. P. Lovecraft, a horror/sci-fi writer from the 1930s, which led me to the 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe King in Yellow\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Robert Chambers, which is similar, but from the late 1800s and some of the stories are set in the far future year of 1920.'b''b'LISTENING'b' Well, this week, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been listening to some Bowie because he just died and I liked his music a lot. The first concert I went to in high school was 'b'David Bowie and the Spiders from Mars'b' at 'b'Veterans Stadium'b' in Philadelphia. But I typically listen to harder rock, including some modern stuff \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Mastodon'b' and 'b'Wolfmother'b' \xe2\x80\x94 but also bands from the \xe2\x80\x9990s like 'b'Soundgarden'b' and earlier classic metal. I think classic metal is the most like opera of all the pop forms because of the way it prizes male virtuosity, the themes having to do with demons and the theatricality.'b''b'WATCHING'b' I like to watch cartoons, which is probably some weird holdover from when I was a kid and got really disappointed at 5 p.m. when the UHF channels would switch from cartoons to 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGilligan\xe2\x80\x99s Island\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThree\xe2\x80\x99s Company.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRick and Morty\xe2\x80\x9d'b' is my current favorite, followed by 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cArcher\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and then 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSouth Park\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFuturama.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' And there\xe2\x80\x99s also 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVenture Bros.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' in which David Bowie is one of the main villains and they quote his songs in the show.'b''b'FOLLOWING'b' 'b'XKCD'b', which is a nerdy web comic, and I am anxiously awaiting the next installment of 'b'What If?'b' on the site, which closely mirrors our interview questions at my company. They ask physics questions, while ours are more life sciences and toxicology questions, like, how much would a pregnant woman have to drink before she got her baby drunk? Our company got included with places like Google and Microsoft for, like, the 10 weirdest interview questions ever.'b''b'PLAYING'b' I love to play, since I was a kid, board games. They can be strategy games, puzzle games, cooperative games. My favorite one right now is called 'b'Le Havre'b' and involves playing a businessman in a port city who buys and sells companies, buys and ships cargo, pays workers. There are a lot of games that are not Milton Bradley or about war.'b''b'CHOPPING'b' My biggest hobby and my only exercise is chopping wood. I would like lifting weights if it was for a purpose. With chopping wood, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished something. Using my woodstove, I can heat my house to a very decadent warm temperature that I would feel way too guilty doing if it were heating with gas or oil. Chopping wood is also a sensuous experience \xe2\x80\x94 it smells nice, makes a great sound, and you\xe2\x80\x99re outdoors. Since June, I think I have chopped and stacked about nine tons of wood.'b'BRETT SMILEY was no 'b'David Bowie'b'.'b'In fact, the album the 18-year-old Mr. Smiley made with the Rolling Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham in 1974, \xe2\x80\x9cBreathlessly Brett,\xe2\x80\x9d didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see the light of day until 40 years had passed.'b'But he was someone you should know. And in what seemed like some sort of cosmic coincidence, he died on Jan. 8, just two days before his immeasurably more successful contemporary.'b'The failure of Mr. Smiley \xe2\x80\x94 or Brett, as I came to know him \xe2\x80\x94 to take his own place in the pantheon of 1970s glam legends wasn\xe2\x80\x99t because of a lack of effort. He was young, American, gorgeous and wrote compelling songs delivered in a breathy, achingly vulnerable voice. Some $100,000 had been invested in starting his career. Disco magazine declared him \xe2\x80\x9cthe Most Beautiful Boy in the World.\xe2\x80\x9d He was poised, on the precipice, ready for his close-up.'b'But \xe2\x80\x9cBreathlessly Brett\xe2\x80\x9d was shelved. \xe2\x80\x9cI just refused to let them release the album,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Oldham said recently in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew it would be a disaster, and we\xe2\x80\x99d already had one \xe2\x80\x94 the 45 r.p.m. release of \xe2\x80\x98Space Ace,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d a song from the record.'b'The astronaut-themed \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Ace,\xe2\x80\x9d with its military-style snare drum rolls, \xe2\x80\x9claunchpad\xe2\x80\x9d sound effects and lush strings might have been titled \xe2\x80\x9cNot Quite Space Oddity.\xe2\x80\x9d The up-tempo, catchy B-side, \xe2\x80\x9cVa Va Va Voom,\xe2\x80\x9d would have made a much better debut. Either way, Brett\xe2\x80\x99s glam career crash-landed, and Mr. Bowie \xe2\x80\x94 and the rest of the world \xe2\x80\x94 moved on.'b'In 1977, Brett landed a part in \xe2\x80\x9cCinderella,\xe2\x80\x9d a low-budget soft-porn flick. Appearing in a movie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a big stretch; he had understudied the lead role in \xe2\x80\x9cOliver\xe2\x80\x9d on Broadway for a little over a month in 1965. But it was the last major gasp from Brett, who like so many in the hedonistic \xe2\x80\x9970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s was wooed by assorted mind-altering substances. And off he went.'b'By the time I met Brett in Central Park in 1988 while playing Frisbee, his time had passed. To me he was a skinny, friendly, vaguely beat-up-looking man who, like me, carried a guitar everywhere he went. We talked, we jammed, he played me one of his new songs \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the Head to the Heart\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and he told me to throw out one line of a new song I had just written called \xe2\x80\x9cQuittin\xe2\x80\x99 Time.\xe2\x80\x9d It was good advice.'b'We kept seeing each other in the park on weekends and then one last time, for a few hours, at a mutual friend\xe2\x80\x99s house. Eventually, he told me the story of his 15 minutes of almost-stardom, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t really care. There was no Internet and I could not look up photos, hear recordings or see his and Mr. Oldham\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on Russell Harty\xe2\x80\x99s British TV show. (But 'b'you can.)'b''b'I just liked the guy; he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a dude or a bro, but neither was he overly touchy-feely. I was aching at the time for guidance, particularly with music, and Brett gave it to me without being asked. There was something lovable about him. Such is the nature of born stars, whether they become famous or not; you just want to be around them.'b'When Brett suddenly disappeared and I eventually made inquiries, I was told he\xe2\x80\x99d succumbed again to drugs and had fled to California. I soon left New York to live in an Indian ashram. The past rapidly seemed a millennium away, and the \xe2\x80\x9980s were cemented in pop culture almost as soon as they were over.'b'I remembered Brett all through the next three decades, though \xe2\x80\x94 his face, his manner and especially the fact that he never complained about his faded career or his drug addiction; he didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to feel sorry for himself.'b'Shaken to the core in the wake of David Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s death last week, I thought of glam and decided, after all these years, to Google Brett Smiley.'b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised, knowing his history, to see the headline \xe2\x80\x9cBrett Smiley Dies at 60,\xe2\x80\x9d but was gobsmacked to see he\xe2\x80\x99d died in his Brooklyn apartment just 48 hours before Mr. Bowie. He\xe2\x80\x99d been found, the obituaries said, by family members and a friend who had been unable to contact him by phone.'b'And thus I spent the better part of the day getting to know the Brett I had never known and falling in love with the tiny, beautiful creature on the cover of \xe2\x80\x9cBreathlessly Brett\xe2\x80\x9d as one might have in 1974 \xe2\x80\x94 in the den with friends gathered around a turntable or in one\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom. There was also Andrew Loog Oldham and a nervous Brett Smiley debuting on British TV with \xe2\x80\x9cSpace Ace,\xe2\x80\x9d which Brett had expected to mime but had to perform live. His songs have played nonstop on my iPod since I downloaded them two days ago. It\xe2\x80\x99s all Brett, all the time.'b'David Bowie, by contrast, does not need me to mourn him. I saw the 1976 film \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man Who Fell to Earth\xe2\x80\x9d when it came out (though I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand it). I pulled my car over to listen to \xe2\x80\x9cAshes to Ashes\xe2\x80\x9d in 1980 the first time it came over the radio because the snapping bass guitar opening the song was so compelling; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know it was Mr. Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s song until he started singing. I watched him at Live Aid during a break from the restaurant I was working at near Washington Square Park in 1985, and I\xe2\x80\x99ve sung the words \xe2\x80\x9cThis is ground control to Major Tom\xe2\x80\x9d in public about 500 times since I was 15. I\xe2\x80\x99ve given him more than 40 years of my life, and the world will no doubt see to his legacy without my help.'b'But maybe Brett Smiley does need me to mourn him. I asked Mr. Oldham for his thoughts, and they were kind. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was an irresistible spirit, a warrior, superb writer and chronicler of his and our times,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Oldham said. \xe2\x80\x9cA good person to have as a friend, a lovable rogue. He will be missed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Brett wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Ziggy Stardust, the Thin White Duke or Major Tom, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up getting to record and hang out with John Lennon and Mick Jagger and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make millions of dollars \xe2\x80\x94 not even close. But he was the Space Ace, as well as a talented, slightly mysterious guy who was nice to me when he had no reason to be. Brett Smiley didn\xe2\x80\x99t change the world, but he\xe2\x80\x99s left it now. He lived a life, and it mattered.'b'JOHN YOUNG was born into slavery, on July 4, 1855. By 15 he was a free man and an electrifying orator, recruiting black voters around his native South Carolina to the Republican Party with \xe2\x80\x9cpyrotechnical\xe2\x80\x9d rhetoric and mustache-waggling jokes. In the late 1860s, it looked as if he might help his party make real change in the post-Civil War South.'b'But soon Young noticed white Northerners losing interest, more concerned with corruption in Washington than freedom in Charleston. His former allies, distracted by scandals, \xe2\x80\x9cjust sat back\xe2\x80\x9d and let the South \xe2\x80\x9cskin us out of our rights,\xe2\x80\x9d he later said. By the late 1870s, anger at government had helped kill Reconstruction, punishing the most vulnerable for the crimes of the most crooked. We should be wary of this today, as we grapple with race and populist rage yet again.'b'Just as in the 1870s, America is struggling against racial inequity 'b'and'b' seething at our political establishment. The two issues appear unrelated, but they have a perverse connection: Anger makes Americans dismiss government and politics altogether \xe2\x80\x94 and that dismissal makes it harder to tackle racial injustice.'b'This was certainly the case, on a far larger scale, in the 1870s, when sentiment against politicians eclipsed black political rights. Reconstruction was a moment of racial promise such as this country had never seen: A generation of former slaves became landowners, teachers, voters and elected officeholders. From 1865 to the early 1870s, the country passed constitutional amendments promising them liberty, citizenship and voting rights. Federal agents helped build schools and banks, and 'b'even crushed the Ku Klux Klan'b'.'b'But reforms in the South depended on the political will of the two-thirds of Americans living outside the region to enforce them. Ohio was typical. It furnished the generals who won the war, and the politicians who made the peace. Yet Ohio was 98.8 percent white. Each reform required persuading voters in Ohio to care about John Young in South Carolina.'b'For a time, a majority of white Northerners supported Reconstruction. Especially in the dominant Republican Party, many let their rage at the former Confederacy push them to back greater racial equality. They were especially proud of their government: The Union that had crushed secession might genuinely improve Americans\xe2\x80\x99 lives, in the South and elsewhere.'b'Political cartoons capture this triumphant faith. In the late 1860s, artists drew black characters in Union Army uniforms \xe2\x80\x94 icons of the powerful nation that had won the war. Instead of using petty politicians to represent the government, cartoonists sketched the proud, classically robed 'b'Columbia'b' (whose name endures but whose role as an avatar of strong government has disappeared).'b'Then came the scandals. In the early 1870s, President Ulysses S. Grant\xe2\x80\x99s buddies were caught stealing and bribing, speculating on gold and dodging whiskey taxes. The New York Times exposed Tammany Hall\xe2\x80\x99s Boss Tweed for stealing as much as $45 million. Tweed was a Democrat, but his thefts made the entire establishment look worse.'b'The avalanche of corruption left Americans blaming what the reformer 'b'Lydia Maria Child'b' called the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral cussedness of governments.\xe2\x80\x9d The fiery Minnesota stump speaker Ignatius Donnelly went further, condemning politicians as \xe2\x80\x9ca genus of shysters and scalawags \xe2\x80\x94 small, mean, tricky little wire-pullers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Who was blamed for white politicians\xe2\x80\x99 dirty tricks? Black leaders. A new type of racist cartoon emerged in the 1870s, depicting black officeholders in gaudy jewelry. Journalists sent accounts north from majority-black regions, mocking \xe2\x80\x9csavage\xe2\x80\x9d African-American leaders, comparing them to Tammany Hall bosses.'b'Northern whites began to give up on the idea that the federal government could or should improve race relations. Horace Greeley, once America\xe2\x80\x99s most influential abolitionist editor, ran against Grant in 1872, combining anger at politicians with hostility toward Reconstruction. He lost, terribly, but not before claiming that blacks \xe2\x80\x9cassume that they need more help from outside than they actually do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This was how the 'b'elephant'b' came to symbolize the Republican Party, as a criticism of an organization that looked bloated and bullying. Former slaves pictured a different beast: Their Republican Party was a war elephant, protecting them from the guerrilla campaign terrorizing black voters. The dispute questioned the fundamental role of parties in American democracy: Were they alliances, protecting the rights of constituents, or \xe2\x80\x9crings,\xe2\x80\x9d conspiring to loot the public?'b'Angry at politicians, and spurred by the crushing depression of 1873, voters gave the Democrats control of Congress in 1874. It was one of the largest landslide shifts in party control in American history. Reconstruction, on the ground, was mostly finished after that. Federal soldiers and agents largely withdrew from the South, and political support for black politicians dried up. The abandonment, wrote a slave-turned-politician in Mississippi, felt \xe2\x80\x9cpathetic in the extreme.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No generation of Americans had more reason to go after the crooks in government, and no generation misplaced its rage so devastatingly. But anger at politicians did not stop with Reconstruction. In the Gilded Age, faith in leadership dimmed even further. Gone was the triumphant Columbia, replaced by caricatures of thieving officeseekers stuffing their pockets with public money. Government stepped back from protecting those rights it had promised after the war.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ve got nothing on the 1870s today. That era saw the largest terrorist conspiracy in our history, suppressing black voters and killing hundreds if not thousands, while corrupt officials stole millions of dollars. But themes from that era \xe2\x80\x94 suspicion of government, struggles over race \xe2\x80\x94 run through American history. And sometimes, one issue blares so loudly that it drowns out the rest.'b'In 2016, political outrage again threatens to overwhelm calls for racial change. If we\xe2\x80\x99re serious about addressing ingrained inequality, from schools to prisons to workplaces, Americans will need to trust government to make reforms, and support the kind of leadership we\xe2\x80\x99ve come to view so cynically. Otherwise, our tendency toward vague, angry rhetoric will discourage risk-taking, and ultimately maintain the racial status quo.'b'Yet our era, like the years after the Civil War, also presents a rare moment of possibility. If we keep both issues in focus, Americans might bring unprecedented racial change 'b'and'b' clean up government. We could use the momentum of one to affect the other, joining the new crop of black activists with older white voters mobilized against business as usual. We might achieve what John Young had been working for all along.'b'TWO of our most vital industries, health care and education, have become increasingly subjected to metrics and measurements. Of course, we need to hold professionals accountable. But the focus on numbers has gone too far. We\xe2\x80\x99re hitting the targets, but missing the point.'b'Through the 20th century, we adopted a hands-off approach, assuming that the pros knew best. Most experts believed that the ideal \xe2\x80\x9cproducts\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 healthy patients and well-educated kids \xe2\x80\x94 were too strongly influenced by uncontrollable variables (the sickness of the patient, the intellectual capacity of the student) and were too complex to be judged by the measures we use for other industries.'b'By the early 2000s, as evidence mounted that both fields were producing mediocre outcomes at unsustainable costs, the pressure for measurement became irresistible. In health care, we saw hundreds of thousands of deaths from medical errors, poor coordination of care and backbreaking costs. In education, it became clear that our schools were lagging behind those in other countries.'b'So in came the consultants and out came the yardsticks. In health care, we applied metrics to outcomes and processes. Did the doctor document that she gave the patient a flu shot? That she counseled the patient about smoking? In education, of course, the preoccupation became student test scores.'b'All of this began innocently enough. But the measurement fad has spun out of control. There are so many different hospital ratings that 'b'more than 1,600 medical centers'b' can now lay claim to being included on a \xe2\x80\x9ctop 100,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chonor roll,\xe2\x80\x9d grade \xe2\x80\x9cA\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d hospitals list. Burnout rates for doctors top 50 percent, far higher than other professions. A 2013 study found that the electronic health record was a dominant culprit. Another 2013 study found that emergency room doctors clicked a mouse 4,000 times during a 10-hour shift. The computer systems have become the dark force behind quality measures.'b'Education is experiencing its own version of measurement fatigue. Educators complain that the focus on student test performance comes at the expense of learning. Art, music and physical education have withered, because, really, why bother if they\xe2\x80\x99re not on the test?'b'At first, the pushback from doctors and teachers was dismissed as whining from entitled and entrenched guilds spoiled by generations of unfettered autonomy. It was natural, went the thinking, that these professionals would resist the scrutiny and discipline of performance assessment. Of course, this interpretation was partly right.'b'But the objections became harder to dismiss as evidence mounted that even superb and motivated professionals had come to believe that the boatloads of measures, and the incentives to \xe2\x80\x9clook good,\xe2\x80\x9d had led them to turn away from the essence of their work. In medicine, doctors no longer made eye contact with patients as they clicked away. In education, even parents who favored more testing around Common Core standards worried about the damaging influence of all the exams.'b'Even some of the measurement behemoths are now voicing second thoughts. Last fall, the Joint Commission, the major accreditor of American hospitals, announced that it was suspending its annual rating of hospitals. At the same time, alarmed by the amount of time that testing robbed from instruction, the Obama administration called for new limits on student testing. Last week, Andy Slavitt, Medicare\xe2\x80\x99s acting administrator, announced the end of a program that tied Medicare payments to a long list of measures related to the use of electronic health records. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to get the hearts and minds of physicians back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Slavitt. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve lost them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Thoughtful and limited assessment can be effective in motivating improvements and innovations, and in weeding out the rare but disproportionately destructive bad apples.'b'But in creating a measurement and accountability system, we need to tone down the fervor and think harder about the unanticipated consequences.'b'Measurement cannot go away, but it needs to be scaled back and allowed to mature. We need more targeted measures, ones that have been vetted to ensure that they really matter. In medicine, for example, measuring the rates of certain hospital-acquired infections has led to a greater emphasis on prevention and has most likely saved lives. On the other hand, measuring whether doctors documented that they provided discharge instructions to heart failure or asthma patients at the end of their hospital stay sounds good, but turns out to be an exercise in futile box-checking, and should be jettisoned.'b'We also need more research on quality measurement and comparing different patient populations. The only way to understand whether a high mortality rate, or dropout rate, represents poor performance is to adequately appreciate all of the factors that contribute to these outcomes \xe2\x80\x94 physical and mental, social and environmental \xe2\x80\x94 and adjust for them. It\xe2\x80\x99s like adjusting for the degree of difficulty when judging an Olympic diver. We\xe2\x80\x99re getting better at this, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not good enough.'b'Most important, we need to fully appreciate the burden that measurement places on professionals, and minimize it. In health care, some of this will come through advances in natural language processing, which may ultimately allow us to assess the quality of care by having computers \xe2\x80\x9cread\xe2\x80\x9d the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s note, obviating the need for all the box-checking. In both fields, simulation, video review and peer coaching hold promise.'b'Whatever we do, we have to ask our clinicians and teachers whether measurement is working, and truly listen when they tell us that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. Today, that is precisely what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying.'b'Avedis Donabedian, a professor at the University of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s School of Public Health, was a towering figure in the field of quality measurement. He developed what is known as Donabedian\xe2\x80\x99s triad, which states that quality can be measured by looking at outcomes (how the subjects fared), processes (what was done) and structures (how the work was organized). In 2000, shortly before he died, he was asked about his view of quality. What this hard-nosed scientist answered is shocking at first, then somehow seems obvious.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe secret of quality is love,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Our businesslike efforts to measure and improve quality are now blocking the altruism, indeed the love, that motivates people to enter the helping professions. While we\xe2\x80\x99re figuring out how to get better, we need to tread more lightly in assessing the work of the professionals who practice in our most human and sacred fields.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Arguably, the world is changing faster than at any point in history \xe2\x80\x94 in global warming, migration, technology, terrorism, national borders and genetics. The overriding challenge for the next president will be to coolly assess, prioritize and act on these daunting threats and opportunities.'b'Our first instinct is to recoil from change, taking refuge in a simpler, more prosperous time, 1950s Middle America, for example. The Constitution also looms large as a touchstone, to which literalists brook no challenge. If we can just turn back the clock following the letter of its 1787 precepts, change can be held at bay.'b'Yet the founding fathers were not at all terrified by change, but instead embraced it in the Constitution. They would, no doubt, be appalled by the political discourse of today and by those who claim to be disciples asserting a monopoly over their thinking and masterpiece. Their genius lay precisely in knowing that future crises could not be imagined in their time, leaving us the flexibility to respond to change and avoiding the pitfalls of rigid prescriptions.'b'Overreaction to change can also sap our strength. American exceptionalism, once shorthand for our can-do spirit and self-confidence, has been stood on its head as a bulwark against change on immigration, taxes and health. Seen from abroad, where I served for three decades, it conveys arrogance and a belief that entities like the World Court, and treaties on the Law of the Sea, the environment and human rights, simply don\xe2\x80\x99t apply to us.'b'Our next president must not shrink from long overdue reforms, but must lead with them. Both the president and Congress must keep in mind Chief Justice John Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s 1821 dictum that \xe2\x80\x9ca constitution is framed for ages to come, and is designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.\xe2\x80\x9d Put differently, effective governance lies somewhere between revisionism and textualism.'b'RICHARD L. JACKSON'b'Wellington, Fla.'b''b'The writer is a retired diplomat, college president and freelance writer.'b''b'The single most urgent function of our Constitution is to ensure that the rights of those who lack the votes to enact policy are not wrongfully diminished or debased because of their minority status. That imperative is timeless and should not be subject to changing mores, concepts or language.'b'But to the extent that the Constitution also serves as a blueprint for governance, it is foolish to worship words or concepts crafted in another time to deal with a very different world. Many of the founders had perspectives about slavery, race, punishment, women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and social relationships that are out of step with modern thought and philosophy. Because they knew that change was inevitable, and necessary, they bequeathed to their posterity a document that can live, breathe and adapt.'b'To insist that today\xe2\x80\x99s legal and moral issues be resolved only by reference to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s 18th-century language is not justified. That approach straitjackets our society and inhibits its continued growth and world leadership.'b'GERALD HARRIS'b'New York'b''b'The writer is a retired criminal court judge.'b''b'I would go even further than Mr. Jackson: Constitutional originalism, which opposes constitutional flexibility, is a bankrupt philosophy. To the extent that we know their views, the founders disagreed about most important matters, and generally understood the need to adapt to changing circumstances. Given that we are today a postindustrial society governed by a preindustrial document, thank heavens that the Constitution itself is often naggingly vague; it could not have otherwise survived.'b'Of course the document\xe2\x80\x99s text and \xe2\x80\x9coriginal meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d to the extent it can be discerned, still matter. But those who swear fealty to originalism play a legal fool\xe2\x80\x99s game by pretending that the most profound societal changes somehow cannot or should not factor into present decisions.'b'ROBERT J.

The founding fathers don\xe2\x80\x99t need Mr. Jackson to come to their defense. No one has accused them of being terrified of change. They deliberately provided a constitutional process for amending the Constitution.'b'In fact, the founding fathers provided a second mechanism for amending the Constitution: It requires Congress to call a constitutional convention to propose amendments when two-thirds of the states apply for such a convention. But if you mention that option, you will find all the liberals running as fast as they can in the other direction. Who exactly is terrified of change?'b'Liberals don\xe2\x80\x99t want \xe2\x80\x9cwe the people\xe2\x80\x9d to amend the Constitution in the ways prescribed by the founding fathers. They want liberal justices to stealthily amend the Constitution. That has worked for them in the past.

Do you look at what they were trying to achieve, the general principles they were trying to apply, or do you assume that those are self-evident from words they chose?'b'That question becomes more complicated when the very definitions of the words change over time. What is intended, for example, by the words \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed\xe2\x80\x9d? Does that mean all arms of every description, for all people regardless of age or past criminal record? Or the words \xe2\x80\x9ca well-regulated militia.\xe2\x80\x9d Are those words meant to apply to a group of armed government protesters who deem themselves a militia?

The most gifted of them could not have imagined our world of today. Other nations with written constitutions often revamp them as changing times demand. Arguably, we should do the same, though always with careful, thoughtful deliberation and never in haste.'b'JOHN C. FRANDSEN'b'Auburn, Ala.'b'Some so-called conservatives claim that the Constitution should be read only in the most constricted manner possible and that amendments are the only legitimate means to resolve vital new questions. Should those brittle prescriptions ever be broadly adopted, their folly would soon be evident, but not before risking our entire legal system, if not the Republic. Even if the arduous amendment process could be made to address every unforeseen issue, our Constitution would become ever longer and more complicated, its great principles diluted until one day it would be a broken-down pile of words on its way to the scrap heap of history.

I did not mean to imply, as Mr. Maitland suggests, that the founding fathers were in any way afraid of change or in need of defense. It is their self-proclaimed literalist disciples of today that concern me. As Judge Harris writes, the founders purposely designed a document that can \xe2\x80\x9clive, breathe and adapt\xe2\x80\x9d to changes that they could have never foreseen. The specific questions aptly posed by Mr. Mantis are ones that thankfully the Constitution gives us the flexibility to confront \xe2\x80\x9cwith careful, thoughtful deliberation and never in haste,\xe2\x80\x9d just as Mr. Frandsen proposes.'b'I do not, however, share Mr. Wheeler\xe2\x80\x99s fear that the amendment process could one day leave the Constitution a \xe2\x80\x9cbroken-down pile of words\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cthe scrap heap of history.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, at least for the time being, I take heart in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s full embrace in his State of the Union speech of \xe2\x80\x9cchange that\xe2\x80\x99s reshaping the way we live, the way we work, our planet and our place in the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'RICHARD JACKSON'b'Wellington, Fla.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'OVER the last two decades, more and more Americans have begun patronizing their local farmers markets. From 1994 to 2014, the number of farmers markets throughout the country increased almost fivefold. Many consumers frequent these markets because they believe that the foods they purchase there are healthier and safer than the same items sold at supermarkets, posing less risk of food-borne illness.'b'Yet no one really knows whether what is sold at farmers markets is less likely to make you sick. For one thing, the publicly available data on food-borne illness from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are limited: Only the location where the food was prepared is available, and even that is not always recorded. You cannot use these data to link an outbreak or case of food-borne illness to the specific place where the food was purchased.'b'But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that you can\xe2\x80\x99t look for intriguing correlations. Two colleagues and I recently assembled a data set that matched the number of cases and outbreaks of food-borne illness with the number of farmers markets in each state and in each year for 2004, 2006, and 2008 to 2013.'b'As we will report in an updated version of an unpublished 'b'working paper'b' released last summer, we found correlations that, in statistical parlance, are too robust to ignore. First, we found a positive correlation between the number of farmers markets per capita in a given state and in a given year and the number of reported outbreaks, regardless of type, of food-borne illness per capita in that state that year. Then, we found a similar positive correlation between farmers markets per capita and reported individual cases of food-borne illness per capita.'b'More interestingly, we found similar positive correlations between farmers markets per capita and outbreaks per capita of 'b'norovirus'b', a common cause of gastroenteritis. Likewise, we found a similar positive correlation between farmers markets per capita and outbreaks per capita of 'b'Campylobacter jejuni'b', a bacterium typically found in animal feces that is also a common cause of gastroenteritis.'b'Our analysis also uncovered a number of dogs that did not bark. We found no statistically significant relationship between farmers markets per capita in a given state in a given year and reported outbreaks or cases of salmonella, E. coli or staph.'b'Throughout our analyses, we controlled for those factors that remain constant over time for each state. For a case of food-borne illness to show up in our data, for example, the person who becomes ill must consult a doctor. That doctor then has to notify county health authorities. Finally, county health authorities have to notify the Centers for Disease Control.'b'States, however, vary in how assiduously they report food-borne illness to the C.D.C. Controlling for constant factors allows us to rule out the possibility that our results are driven by states that both are better at reporting food-borne illness and have more farmers markets per capita.'b'Similarly, our analyses control for income per capita and, because the consumers who shop at farmers markets tend to be more educated than those who do not, for the proportion of college graduates in each state and in each year.'b'My co-authors and I are applied economists, not farmers, food scientists or epidemiologists. It is important to emphasize that our findings are correlations and that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Given available data and methods, we can\xe2\x80\x99t say whether the rise of farmers markets has actually caused an increase in the number of cases and outbreaks of food-borne illness.'b'And even if our results did identify a causal relationship between farmers markets and food-borne illness, it would not be possible to identify the precise mechanisms through which this happens, and it would be a critical mistake to conclude that the foods sold at farmers markets are themselves to blame. That is because most cases of illness are caused by consumers who undercook or fail to wash their food. Indeed, our results may suggest that many people erroneously believe that food bought at farmers markets needn\xe2\x80\x99t be washed because it is \xe2\x80\x9cnatural.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Farmers markets are now part and parcel of the American food landscape. The correlations we have identified certainly constitute an issue that farmers, distributors, vendors, consumers and academics should look into more closely. Though more research is needed to identify any possible causes, policy prescriptions could be as simple as encouraging patrons of farmers markets to wash their produce more thoroughly.'b'Lawrence, Kan. \xe2\x80\x94 I TOOK my first secretarial job in college, where I worked down the hall from a Triga Mark II nuclear reactor. I lasted just two lonely weeks, waiting to answer nonexistent phone calls and compulsively checking my radiation exposure badge.'b'Three years and three secretarial jobs later, my new employers referred to me as an \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative assistant.\xe2\x80\x9d They seemed to believe that the new title conferred greater respect for my work; yet no one has ever suggested that the secretary of state should be called the administrative assistant of state.'b'About the same time that I became an administrative assistant, I finished my master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in creative writing. My mother, who named me after a college I would never attend, expected me to pursue a doctorate and become a professor. My grandmother knew better. After all, she was the one who trained me to be a secretary.'b'For most of my childhood, my after-school day care involved walking the five blocks over to the law office where my grandmother worked. There, I sat in the back room and read library books while my grandmother answered phones, took dictation and typed letters. She would not have looked out of place on the set of \xe2\x80\x9cMad Men\xe2\x80\x9d: poised, perfectly coifed, lipsticked and imperturbable. The quintessential secretary.'b'Her manicured nails produced a delicious clicking against the keys of her new electric typewriter that roused me from my reading. Her retired Underwood No. 5, a hulking tangle of keys and levers, glistened black and chrome under a layer of dust in the storage room. When I made my first attempts at it, I barely had the strength to depress the keys and engage the steel trap of its type hammers.'b'Other women, on hearing my first tentative pecks, might have shooed me away, but my grandmother gave me a stack of discarded paper and showed me how to spool it into the typewriter. From there, I was hooked. Not just on the mechanical pleasures of keys striking paper and leaving a mark, but on what it all was for: the words on the page.'b'By then, Grandma was using an IBM Selectric II typewriter, producing mountains of onionskin legal filings from that humming, chattering beast at 120 words per minute. When Grandma deemed my typing adequate, she gave me real letters to practice on. When they were perfect, they went to the lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s desk for his signature. Even then, it was clear to me that without a secretary, the lawyer wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to do much lawyering if he had also needed to type briefs, answer the phone and make his own coffee.'b'The other thing I understood was that this was how books were made. I\xe2\x80\x99d seen photos of Ernest Hemingway and Pearl Buck at work on their novels, and I knew if I was going to be a writer, I would need to be able to type. In my mind, typing was necessary to writing, and secretaries were the foremost experts in typing.'b'When the time came to choose between a secretarial career or the uncertain prospect of a job in academia, the choice was easy. The secretaries I knew seemed happier than the doctoral students I knew, and when they left work at the end of the day, the secretaries had plenty of time for gardening and needlepoint. I skipped all the lesson planning and paper grading, and made writing my after-hours hobby.'b'I became a career secretary in the late 1990s, just as everything was changing. Typewriters gave way to computers. The mimeograph machine that started me down the road to tendinitis gave way to a photocopier. Electronic mail and calendars promised to make secretaries obsolete \xe2\x80\x94 even if they haven\xe2\x80\x99t yet succeeded. And men started to return to the field, after a 100-year hiatus.'b'Calling secretaries \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative assistants\xe2\x80\x9d was supposed to make our work more dignified, but it often feels like a thin veneer over a contempt for women\xe2\x80\x99s work. That\xe2\x80\x99s nowhere more clear than in offices where men have recently been hired as administrative assistants. Even if he has no prior secretarial experience, a man will often receive a higher salary than his fellow secretaries who are female.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s just the start of it. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had every aspect of my appearance critiqued by supervisors, from my hair being \xe2\x80\x9ctoo curly\xe2\x80\x9d to a boss who told me to \xe2\x80\x9cnever wear that dress again,\xe2\x80\x9d because it reminded him of his mother. I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a polo- and khaki-clad male administrative assistant policed on his appearance.'b'In one job I had a few years back, in an office of five secretaries, it was impossible not to notice that the lone man was never expected to answer phones or wash dishes. I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen male supervisors made so uncomfortable by a man performing \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s work\xe2\x80\x9d that, having hired him, they conspired to promote him, no matter how poorly qualified he was.'b'The sad fact is that so many people who utterly rely on secretaries still consider the work demeaning. \xe2\x80\x9cSecretary\xe2\x80\x9d comes from the same Latin root that gives us \xe2\x80\x9csecret,\xe2\x80\x9d and a secretary is, above all, the repository of institutional knowledge. Institutional secrets. A secretary is the bedrock of any office \xe2\x80\x94 something people choose to overlook until she is unexpectedly out sick and chaos reigns.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the secretary who deals with walk-ins, including the homeless woman who dresses like a nun and insists on dousing everything with her \xe2\x80\x9choly water,\xe2\x80\x9d which contains a higher concentration of vodka than most holy water. It\xe2\x80\x99s the secretary who solves the jammed copy machine and finds the right condolence card.'b'And she is everyone\xe2\x80\x99s confidante, whether she wants to be or not.'b'The truth is, even after 20 years of working as a secretary, I am less of one than my grandmother was. I abandoned pantyhose and heels, and I never achieved 120 w.p.m. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also been promoted into management \xe2\x80\x94 a career move once impossible for a woman. I supervise a handful of secretaries and, be they male or female, I do my best to ensure they\xe2\x80\x99re treated with the dignity they deserve.'b'As a manager, I retain the aura of a former secretary. No one expects me to make coffee, but they think nothing of asking me to type up minutes for their meetings. When they do, I try to channel my Grandma\xe2\x80\x99s spirit. I freshen up my lip gloss, tidy my unruly hair and never look at my hands when I type.'b'Last week I suffered through another 'b'dust-dry Republican debate'b' in which a slimmed-down roster of seven candidates leveled many of the same attacks and regurgitated many of the same staid pitches.'b'There were a few flashes of life that caught my attention or made me chuckle:'b'Ted Cruz debuting some entertaining lines of attack to rebuff the questions the real estate developer keeps raising about whether Cruz is indeed a \xe2\x80\x9cnatural born citizen\xe2\x80\x9d and able to become president.

They are describing a coming apocalypse from which we must be saved, not a future that is full of light. Indeed, it is as if they must inflate some mythical beast so that they will appear more valiant in their quest to slay it.

At least Ben Carson, with his meandering, absent-minded answer, came across as positive \xe2\x80\x94 not by his policies so much as by his soft-spoken, easy to laugh, slow to attack demeanor. But even that, during the most recent debate, didn\xe2\x80\x99t work. Carson came off as more jester than that cogent candidate.

At some point, someone among the Republican candidates will have to offer a positive message to reach the middle of the voter spectrum and the crossover voters that one needs to win the presidency. If not, this field is destined to be remembered as a group of hyperbolic doomsayers rather than as successful presidential politicians.'b'The Treasury Department 'b'announced'b' last week that it would start demanding the identities of the people behind the shell companies that rich foreigners use to buy real estate in Manhattan and Miami-Dade County. This is a good step that should help law enforcement agencies crack down on money laundering, tax evasion and other crimes. But the program should be broadened to cover the whole country, and it must be forcefully carried out.'b'In recent years, oligarchs, corrupt politicians, business executives and suspected criminals have stashed billions of dollars of wealth in the United States by buying condominiums, mansions and other costly assets. As 'b'documented by The Times'b' last year, these purchases are generally made through limited liability corporations that are not required to disclose their owners or beneficiaries. The secrecy is so complete that even law enforcement officials say they are often unable to identify the true owners.'b'The crux of the problem is that states \xe2\x80\x94 especially Delaware, Nevada and Wyoming \xe2\x80\x94 have made it easy for people to set up shell companies without providing any personal information. While limited liability corporations have many legitimate purposes, there is no justification for allowing owners to shield their identities even from law enforcement and regulators. These states appear to be mainly motivated by a desire to earn corporation filing fees, legal costs and related revenue.'b'Unfortunately, efforts by lawmakers like Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Representative Carolyn Maloney, Democrat of New York, to require greater disclosure have been thwarted by lobbying from the financial and real estate industries and state governments. That makes it even more important that the Treasury Department take stronger action than it has so far.'b'The department currently requires mortgage lenders to know the identities of the true owners of shell companies in transactions that 'b'involve loans. 'b' Lenders also have to report suspicious activity to the department. Under the new policy, the department\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 'b'will require real estate title companies to report to it the true owners of limited liability companies that buy properties without loans. However, the order applies only to Manhattan and Miami-Dade County, and will be effective for only 180 days, starting in March.'b'At the end of that period, after studying trends and activities, the agency will decide whether to extend and broaden the program. It is absurd that regulators would not require such basic transparency as a matter of course. The current system practically condones money laundering and tax evasion. It lays out the welcome mat for foreigners hiding assets from their governments, making the United States one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'biggest tax havens'b'.'b'For the same reasons, the Treasury Department should adopt 'b'pending regulations'b' that would require banks, brokerages and other financial firms to know who owns the limited liability companies whose accounts they manage. The rule ought to apply to existing and new accounts. Washington should also share the data it collects with other governments to help them identify tax evasion and other crimes. The 'b'United States already requires'b' banks in other countries to report money Americans hold abroad. It is only fair that this country reciprocate.'b'Supporters of the current system may argue that requiring more transparency would burden financial institutions without ending money laundering and tax evasion. While determined criminals will find ways to thwart the law, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t justify doing nothing about this hole in financial regulations.'b'Washington \xe2\x80\x94 THE other day while I was crossing the street in Beijing, a car almost flattened me. Both the driver and I were outraged at the other\xe2\x80\x99s ineptitude. In 'b'China'b', if you want to avoid being hit, you keep your head down and avoid eye contact with the oncoming driver, since looking at him would signal that you saw the car and know you should let it pass. In the United States, the opposite rule applies: Making eye contact confirms that the driver has seen you and should yield to the vulnerable pedestrian.'b'Something similar is occurring now between China and global financial markets. Billions in renminbi and dollars could be lost while trying to untangle the lines of communication.'b'Chinese bureaucrats believe that they have the right to intervene in their country\xe2\x80\x99s economy whenever they want, not only to promote certain industries but also to prevent sudden downturns and reduce volatility. Officials believe that they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to defend or explain their decisions in real time to market participants. In fact, being opaque preserves their discretion to make changes on the fly.'b'This approach goes against the operating principles of global financial markets: clarity and timely transparency. Intervention should be the exception, not the norm.'b'The job of regulators should be to ensure a fair market, but China\xe2\x80\x99s stock market is worse than a casino, as Chinese regulators\xe2\x80\x99 goals and the basic rules of the game can shift without warning. With China\xe2\x80\x99s housing market in disarray in 2014, authorities invited investors to shift their capital to the stock market and then took a series of steps to facilitate high returns. When the market started to nose-dive last summer, officials wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let the bubble that had inevitably formed fully burst. Instead they suspended trading for some companies, mopped up shares, ordered large shareholders not to sell and accused market analysts of spreading false rumors.'b'Regulators were at it again earlier this month, delaying the trading of stocks that had been frozen since last summer and even suddenly declaring that the market would temporarily halt trading if the Shanghai index rose or fell 5 percent. All this did was give investors just enough time to hit the sell button when markets restarted. About four days after it was started, this tool was abandoned without apology. Some investors have lost their shirts, but no regulators have lost their jobs.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s currency missteps have been equally maddening. The market suggests that the renminbi is overvalued because a strengthening or even stable renminbi is inconsistent with the country\xe2\x80\x99s expanding debt burden and slowing economic growth. China\xe2\x80\x99s central bank has taken some steps to liberalize the exchange rate, measuring the renminbi against a broader basket of currencies instead of the dollar. But because Chinese officials continue to publicly assert the renminbi is not overvalued, they are intervening daily to prop up the currency. And they have imposed a range of capital controls.'b'Based on my interviews, Chinese officials believe these steps are preserving economic stability and facilitating gradual change, while investors who see policies change constantly with little apparent rationale have had their confidence in officials\xe2\x80\x99 ability badly shaken.'b'Frustration with China has prompted calls for a regulatory response. Some in Congress have long clamored for the Treasury Department to label China a currency manipulator and issue sanctions. Even Donald J. Trump has advocated for a 45 percent across-the-board tariff on Chinese imports. But given that China is not trying to depress its currency to make its products more competitive, penalties are not justified. Nor would they work; they might make Washington feel better, but American investors, producers and consumers would all suffer from the resulting tit-for-tat.'b'The Obama administration instead should take a page out of the human rights playbook and privately raise the harmful effects of interventionism and delaying liberalization with the Chinese every chance it gets until the message gets through. And if it does not, American officials should step before the cameras and let markets know how disappointed they are with China\xe2\x80\x99s policies. President Xi Jinping claimed that last summer\xe2\x80\x99s emergency measures were necessary to prevent \xe2\x80\x9csystemic risks\xe2\x80\x9d to China\xe2\x80\x99s economy, but at a summit meeting in September President Obama essentially did nothing to push Mr. Xi on that issue publicly or privately, implying that the United States accepted this explanation and related policies.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s economic management should also be a central part of multilateral diplomacy. The Group of 7 and Group of 20 nations have issued general calls for flexible exchange rates, transparent market management and greater coordination of macroeconomic policies. But if Chinese interventionism continues to roil global markets, the conversation ought to become much more pointed. At a minimum, governments and world markets deserve far more detailed information from China provided in a far timelier manner than is now the case.'b'If the world economy does not want to be flattened by a Chinese state apparently unaware of how risky its actions are, then we may need to make the conversation about China\xe2\x80\x99s markets much more public. The two sides may not see eye to eye, but no one should avert their glance.'b'IT is no secret that Donald J. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ruinous rise in the Republican presidential primaries has been powered, in large part, by a naked agenda of religious division and fear-mongering \xe2\x80\x94 an agenda that will likely inform his speech today at Liberty University, a conservative Christian college in Lynchburg, Va.'b'But while his anti-Muslim provocations have rightly drawn the largest share of public outrage, Mr. Trump has in fact been using his bully pulpit throughout this election season to attack religious minorities of all stripes. He deploys this tactic on the campaign trail whenever it suits his political purposes, and his religious digs and dog whistles are often so cartoonishly retro that they sound as if they\xe2\x80\x99re being delivered by a billionaire Archie Bunker.'b'In the Gospel According to Trump, there is only one blessedly normal, all-American faith: mainline Protestant Christianity. The Presbyterians, the Methodists, the Baptists \xe2\x80\x94 those believers who once made up this country\xe2\x80\x99s midcentury religious mainstream \xe2\x80\x94 are Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cchosen ones.\xe2\x80\x9d He regards their customs and values as essentially as American as apple pie, while all other faith communities, even other forms of Christianity, seem to rest somewhere on a spectrum from exotic to sinister.'b'Take Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bizarre speech last month to the Republican Jewish Coalition, where he kept inexplicably returning to the same well-worn tropes that anti-Semites have been using for a century. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a negotiator, like you folks,\xe2\x80\x9d he proclaimed to the crowd. Later, he sought to signal defiant distance from the Republican establishment by informing them: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to support me because I don\xe2\x80\x99t want your money.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'While speaking to a crowd of Florida supporters in October, Mr. Trump publicly hinted that there might be something nefarious about Ben Carson\xe2\x80\x99s Seventh-day Adventist faith. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m Presbyterian,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cBoy, that\xe2\x80\x99s down the middle of the road, folks, in all fairness. I mean, Seventh-day Adventist, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about. I just don\xe2\x80\x99t know about.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More recently, he tried to blunt Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s surge in the Iowa polls by using the senator\xe2\x80\x99s Cuban heritage to exoticize his Christian faith. \xe2\x80\x9cI do like Ted Cruz,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump said at a rally in Des Moines, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not a lot of evangelicals come out of Cuba.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is an absurdity in seeing Donald Trump trying to play the role of 2016 religion referee. This is a man whose sincerest praise for the Bible is to deem it 'b'even better'b' than his best-selling book \xe2\x80\x9cThe Art of the Deal,\xe2\x80\x9d a man whose most famous religious experience is having reportedly struck up a romance with his second wife among the pews of a Manhattan church (while he was still married to Ivana).'b'But Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s religious posturing is not about theology, it\xe2\x80\x99s about branding \xe2\x80\x94 and if his religious worldview seems impossibly dated, that\xe2\x80\x99s by design. His entire message, right down to his \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again\xe2\x80\x9d campaign slogan, is rooted in a gnawing nostalgia and economic anxiety that grips much of the country\xe2\x80\x99s white working class. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s target demographic is not America\xe2\x80\x99s most devout, but its most anxious and aggrieved, and what he\xe2\x80\x99s selling isn\xe2\x80\x99t salvation, but a bygone era of plentiful factory jobs, robust pension funds and safe, monochromatic suburbs dotted with little white churches that everyone in town attended on Sundays.'b'By focusing his rhetorical firepower largely on minority faiths that have grown in size and influence in the United States over the past 60 years \xe2\x80\x94 displacing the old Protestant monopoly \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trump is stoking a tribal hostility toward those who worship differently, one that hucksters have seized on throughout history to infect and co-opt America\xe2\x80\x99s faith communities. It is the same visceral force that animated the witch trials in Salem and set fire to the crosses in front of black churches.'b'Encouragingly, recent elections have suggested there\xe2\x80\x99s room in the presidential arena to showcase America\xe2\x80\x99s growing religious diversity. Yet even before he became a candidate, Mr. Trump seemed skeptical that a new era of ecumenical progress might be seeping into American politics. When I interviewed him in 2014, he argued vigorously \xe2\x80\x94 despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary \xe2\x80\x94 that Mitt Romney lost the 2012 election because many Christian voters were put off by his alien faith. Eventually, I had to to interrupt him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m actually Mormon,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.'b'He raised his eyebrows. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He promptly recalibrated, telling me about a Jewish friend (\xe2\x80\x9cgreat guy, rich guy\xe2\x80\x9d) who had moved to Utah and fallen in love with the local creedal breed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cpeople don\xe2\x80\x99t understand the Mormon thing. 'b'I'b' do. 'b'I'b' get it. They are great people!\xe2\x80\x9d But alas, not everyone was so enlightened as Trump. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a religious undercurrent there,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, then hastened to add, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'unfortunately'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Health reform is the signature achievement of the Obama presidency. It was the biggest expansion of the social safety net since 'b'Medicare'b' was established in the 1960s. It more or less achieves a goal \xe2\x80\x94 access to 'b'health insurance'b' for all Americans \xe2\x80\x94 that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations. And it is already producing dramatic results, with the percentage of uninsured Americans falling to 'b'record lows'b'.'b'Obamacare is, however, what engineers would call a kludge: a somewhat awkward, clumsy device with lots of moving parts. This makes it more expensive than it should be, and will probably always cause a significant number of people to fall through the cracks.'b'The question for progressives \xe2\x80\x94 a question that is now central to the Democratic primary \xe2\x80\x94 is whether these failings mean that they should re-litigate their own biggest political success in almost half a century, and try for something better.'b'My answer, as you might guess, is that they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, that they should seek incremental change on health care (Bring back the public option!) and focus their main efforts on other issues \xe2\x80\x94 that is, that Bernie Sanders is wrong about this and Hillary Clinton is right. But the main point is that we should think clearly about why health reform looks the way it does.'b'If we could start from scratch, many, perhaps most, health economists would recommend single-payer, a Medicare-type program covering everyone. But single-payer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a politically feasible goal in America, for three big reasons that aren\xe2\x80\x99t going away.'b'First, like it or not, incumbent players have a lot of power. Private insurers played a major part in killing health reform in the early 1990s, so this time around reformers went for a system that preserved their role and gave them plenty of new business.'b'Second, single-payer would require a lot of additional tax revenue \xe2\x80\x94 and we would be talking about taxes on the middle class, not just the wealthy. It\xe2\x80\x99s true that higher taxes would be offset by a sharp reduction or even elimination of private insurance premiums, but it would be difficult to make that case to the broad public, especially given the chorus of misinformation you know would dominate the airwaves.'b'Finally, and I suspect most important, switching to single-payer would impose a lot of disruption on tens of millions of families who currently have good coverage through their employers. You might say that they would end up just as well off, and it might well be true for most people \xe2\x80\x94 although not those with especially good policies. But getting voters to believe that would be a very steep climb.'b'What this means, as the health policy expert 'b'Harold Pollack'b' points out, is that a simple, straightforward single-payer system just isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen. Even if you imagine a political earthquake that eliminated the power of the insurance industry and objections to higher taxes, you\xe2\x80\x99d still have to protect the interests of workers with better-than-average coverage, so that in practice single-payer, American style, would be almost as kludgy as Obamacare.'b'Which brings me to the Affordable Care Act, which was designed to bypass these obstacles. It was careful to preserve and even enlarge the role of private insurers. Its measures to cover the uninsured rely on a combination of regulation and subsidies, rather than simply on an expansion of government programs, so that the on-budget cost is limited \xe2\x80\x94 and can, in fact, be covered without raising middle-class taxes. Perhaps most crucially, it leaves employer-based insurance intact, so that the great majority of Americans have experienced no disruption, in fact no change in their health-care experience.'b'Even so, achieving this reform was a close-run thing: Democrats barely got it through during the brief period when they controlled Congress. Is there any realistic prospect that a drastic overhaul could be enacted any time soon \xe2\x80\x94 say, in the next eight years? No.'b'You might say that it\xe2\x80\x99s still worth trying. But politics, like life, involves trade-offs.'b'There are many items on the progressive agenda, ranging from an effective climate change policy, to making college affordable for all, to restoring some of the lost bargaining power of workers. Making progress on any of these items is going to be a hard slog, even if Democrats hold the White House and, less likely, retake the Senate. Indeed, room for maneuver will be limited even if a post-Trump Republican Party moves away from the scorched-earth opposition it offered 'b'President Obama'b'.'b'So progressives must set some priorities. And it\xe2\x80\x99s really hard to see, given this picture, why it makes any sense to spend political capital on a quixotic attempt at a do-over, not of a political failure, but of health reform \xe2\x80\x94 their biggest victory in many years.'b'The debate over whether it\xe2\x80\x99s safer for a healthy woman to have a baby at home or in the hospital just tilted a bit in favor of hospital deliveries. The risks in both cases are very low, but a new study suggests that the risk to babies could be higher for out-of-hospital births.'b'A study, based on data from Oregon and published in the 'b'New England Journal of Medicine'b' in December, found that the risk of a baby dying was 3.9 per 1,000 births for deliveries at home or in birth centers, versus 1.8 deaths per 1,000 births in hospitals.'b'Although the vast majority of births occur in hospitals, the percentage of deliveries at home or in birth centers outside hospitals rose to 1.28 percent in 2012, up from 0.79 percent in 2004, in part because a growing number of women want to avoid the high-tech interventionist environment of hospitals. In fact, the study found that planned out-of-hospital births had decreased odds of induced labor, cesarean delivery and other obstetric procedures.'b'Earlier studies in this country and abroad found that deliveries outside hospitals were as safe as hospital deliveries. In late 2014, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s National Health Service 'b'concluded'b' that for healthy women expecting uncomplicated deliveries, it was actually safer for both mother and child if the birth was at home rather than in a hospital maternity ward, where doctors were more likely to use surgical interventions or spinal anesthetics that could cause harm.'b'But one problem with previous studies was that if a crisis developed during a home or birth center delivery that required a transfer to a hospital and the baby subsequently died, it was counted as a hospital death, not as a problem that developed outside the hospital. The latest study is superior because, using data newly available in Oregon, it more accurately shows where the problem occurred, not just where the women ended up giving birth.'b'It is seldom wise to rely too heavily on a single study; nevertheless, the study in the New England Journal of Medicine offers data that doctors and patients should consider.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Judith Shulevitz (\xe2\x80\x9c'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s Payback Time for Women'b',\xe2\x80\x9d Sunday Review, Jan. 10) provides a very interesting economic model for helping to reduce the gap between the haves and the have-nots \xe2\x80\x94 a universal basic income.

The world is now safer for this.'b'The International Atomic Energy Agency verified on Saturday that Iran has shipped over 8.5 tons of enriched uranium to Russia so Iran can\xe2\x80\x99t use that in bomb-making, disabled more than 12,000 centrifuges and poured concrete into the core of a reactor at Arak designed to produce plutonium.'b'On Sunday, President Obama hailed these steps as having \xe2\x80\x9ccut off every single path Iran could have used to build a bomb\xe2\x80\x9d and noted that engagement with Iran has created a \xe2\x80\x9cwindow to try to resolve important issues.\xe2\x80\x9d Most important of all, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve achieved this historic progress through diplomacy, without resorting to another war in the Middle East.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, there are daunting challenges ahead, including ensuring the deal is strictly adhered to, an obligation for the United States, Russia, China and Europe. Cheating should be much harder, given that Iran will be subjected to continuous and intrusive monitoring by the I.A.E.A. of its nuclear enrichment facilities, centrifuge production and uranium mines. And even if the Iranians were to attempt to produce enough nuclear fuel for a bomb, it will now take them more than a year to do so. Before the agreement, that breakout time was two to three months.'b'The deal is a testament to patient diplomacy and President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s visionary determination to pursue a negotiated solution to the nuclear threat, despite relentless attempts by his political opponents to sabotage the initiative. After more than 30 years of hostility between the two countries, President Hassan Rouhani of Iran and his foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who took office in 2013, pursued the nuclear deal and its implementation with a pragmatic and constructive attitude.'b'This is also a moment to celebrate the release of the Washington Post journalist Jason Rezaian and three other Americans of Iranian descent who were detained by Iran, in some cases for years. Mr. Rezaian and the others should never have been held in the first place. Their freedom came in exchange for seven Iranians arrested by the United States on charges of violating sanctions on Iran. Separately, another American who was recently detained was also freed. Resolving disputes often requires compromise, and these developments make it more likely, although far from certain, that the United States and Iran could cooperate in the future.'b'The value of increased American-Iranian engagement was obvious last week when Iran quickly released 10 American sailors after their two patrol 'b'boats mistakenly'b' drifted into Iranian waters in the Persian Gulf. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s hard-line military boarded the ships and released photos of the sailors in custody, a possible violation of the Geneva Conventions. Ordinarily, this would cause a crisis \xe2\x80\x94 and American hard-liners tried to make it so by denouncing Mr. Obama and denouncing Iran. But after a series of phone calls between Secretary of State John Kerry and Mr. Zarif, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, backed Mr. Rouhani and Mr. Zarif, who moved quickly to defuse the incident. Both sides knew a prolonged standoff could put the nuclear deal at risk.'b'Of course, neither compliance with the nuclear agreement nor the release of the Americans means that Iran should not be subject to criticism or new sanctions for violation of other United Nations resolutions or American laws. Once the detained Americans left Iran, Mr. Obama moved quickly to impose new, limited sanctions on 11 Iranian companies and individuals for their involvement in two recent ballistic missile tests.'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s critics are incensed that in return for complying with the nuclear deal, the country will get access to $100 billion of its money that has been frozen in overseas banks and that lifting sanctions will enable it to integrate into the international economy. The critics fear Iran will use the money to destabilize the region further, but Mr. Rouhani\xe2\x80\x99s greater imperative is to spend the funds on the many social and economic needs of Iranians. His promises to improve their lives will be tested during next month\xe2\x80\x99s parliamentary elections.'b'Leaders don\xe2\x80\x99t give up their nuclear weapons for nothing. A bargain with Iran was necessary. It might even serve as an example for dealing with North Korea, which may have enough fuel for 16 weapons and is producing many more.'b'Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \xe2\x80\x94 THE world is watching Iran for signs of change, hoping it will evolve from a rogue revolutionary state into a respectable member of the international community. But Iran, rather than confronting the isolation it has created for itself, opts to obscure its dangerous sectarian and expansionist policies, as well as its support for terrorism, by leveling unsubstantiated charges against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.'b'It is important to understand why Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are committed to resisting Iranian expansion and responding forcefully to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s acts of aggression.'b'Superficially, Iran may appear to have changed. We acknowledge Iran\xe2\x80\x99s initial actions regarding the agreement to suspend its program to develop a nuclear weapon. Certainly, we know that a large segment of the Iranian population wants greater openness internally and better relations with neighboring countries and the world. But the government does not.'b'The Iranian government\xe2\x80\x99s behavior has been consistent since the 1979 revolution. The constitution that Iran adopted states the objective of exporting the revolution. As a consequence, Iran has supported violent extremist groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and sectarian militias in Iraq. Iran or its proxies have been blamed for terrorist attacks around the world, including the bombings of the 'b'United States Marine barracks in Beirut'b' in 1983 and the 'b'Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia'b' in 1996, and the assassinations in 'b'the Mykonos restaurant in Berlin'b' in 1992. And by some estimates Iranian-backed forces have killed over 1,100 American troops in Iraq since 2003.'b'Iran uses attacks on diplomatic sites as an instrument of its foreign policy. The 1979 takeover of the American Embassy in Tehran was only the beginning. Since then, embassies of Britain, Denmark, Kuwait, France, Russia and Saudi Arabia have been attacked in Iran or abroad by Iranian proxies. Foreign diplomats and domestic political opponents have been assassinated around the world.'b'Hezbollah, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s surrogate, tries to control Lebanon and wages war against the Syrian opposition \xe2\x80\x94 and in the process helps the Islamic State flourish. It is clear why Iran wants Bashar al-Assad of Syria to remain in power: In its 2014 report on terrorism, 'b'the State Department wrote'b' that Iran views Syria \xe2\x80\x9cas a crucial causeway to its weapons supply route to Hezbollah.\xe2\x80\x9d The report also noted, citing United Nations data, that Iran provided arms, financing and training \xe2\x80\x9cto support the Assad regime\xe2\x80\x99s brutal crackdown that has resulted in the deaths of at least 191,000 people.\xe2\x80\x9d The same report for 2012 noted that there was \xe2\x80\x9ca marked resurgence of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s state sponsorship of terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d with Iranian and Hezbollah\xe2\x80\x99s terrorist activity \xe2\x80\x9creaching a tempo unseen since the 1990s.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Yemen, Iran\xe2\x80\x99s support for the takeover of the country by the Houthi militia helped cause the war that has killed thousands.'b'While Iran 'b'claims'b' its top foreign policy priority is friendship, its behavior shows the opposite is true. Iran is the single-most-belligerent-actor in the region, and its actions display both a commitment to regional hegemony and a deeply held view that conciliatory gestures signal weakness either on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s part or on the part of its adversaries.'b'In that vein, Iran 'b'tested a ballistic missile'b' on Oct. 10, just months after reaching an agreement on its nuclear program, in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. In December, an Iranian military ship 'b'fired a missile'b' near American and French vessels in international waters. Even since signing the nuclear accord, the supreme leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has defended the country\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous slogan \xe2\x80\x9cDeath to America.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Saudi Arabia will not allow Iran to undermine our security or the security of our allies. We will push back against attempts to do so.'b'In an outlandish lie, Iran maligns and offends all Saudis by saying that my nation, home of the two holy mosques, brainwashes people to spread extremism. We are not the country designated a state sponsor of terrorism; Iran is. We are not the nation under international sanctions for supporting terrorism; Iran is. We are not the nation whose officials are on terrorism lists; Iran is. We don\xe2\x80\x99t have an agent 'b'sentenced to jail for 25 years'b' by a New York federal court for plotting to assassinate an ambassador in Washington in 2011; Iran does.'b'Saudi Arabia has been a victim of terrorism, often at the hands of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s allies. Our country is on the front line of fighting terrorism, working closely with our allies. Saudi Arabia has arrested thousands of terrorism suspects and prosecuted hundreds. Our fight against terrorism is continuing as we lead multinational efforts to pursue those who participate in terrorist activities, those who fund them and those who foment the mind-set that promotes extremism.'b'The real question is whether Iran wants to live by the rules of the international system, or remain a revolutionary state committed to expansion and to defiance of international law. In the end, we want an Iran that works to solve problems in a way that allows people to live in peace. But that will require major changes in Iran\xe2\x80\x99s policy and behavior. We have yet to see that.'b'Oakland, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 ACROSS the country, some 400,000 women, mostly immigrants, work in agriculture, toiling in fields, nurseries and packing plants. Such work is backbreaking and low-paying. But for many of these women, it is also a nightmare of sexual violence.'b'In a 2010 study from the University of California, Santa Cruz, more than 60 percent of the 150 female farmworkers interviewed said they had experienced some form of sexual harassment. In a 2012 report, 'b'Human Rights Watch 'b' surveyed 52 female farmworkers; nearly all of them had experienced sexual violence, or knew others who had. One woman told investigators that her workplace was called the \xe2\x80\x9cfield de calz\xc3\xb3n,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfield of panties.\xe2\x80\x9d As an Iowa immigrant farmworker told her lawyer, \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought it was normal in the United States that in order to keep your job, you had to have sex.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The reasons behind this epidemic aren\xe2\x80\x99t hard to fathom. Fields are vast and sparsely monitored; workers are often alone. It\xe2\x80\x99s particularly bad for immigrant workers: The Department of Labor estimates that about half of farmworkers 'b'don\xe2\x80\x99t have legal immigration papers'b', which makes them especially vulnerable.'b'So do low wages and competition for jobs: Male farmworkers make an estimated $16,250 a year and female ones $11,250 a year. With depressed wages and so many workers competing for the same job, women are hesitant to complain.'b'The problem is hardly a secret. Two decades ago the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, along with California Rural Legal Assistance, a legal service program that promotes the interests of migrant laborers and the rural poor, created a joint project to concentrate on sexual harassment in the fields.'b'In 2005, 'b'the commission won a $994,000 victory for Olivia Tamayo'b', a worker at one of California\xe2\x80\x99s largest cattle-feeding operations, who was repeatedly raped by her supervisor. \xe2\x80\x9cHe took advantage because he knew I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to say anything,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'she told Ms. Magazine.'b' \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a trauma that followed me everywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In September, in one of the largest settlements of its kind, the commission won over $17 million for five farmworkers in Florida who had accused their supervisors of rape and harassment. Some 18 similar cases nationally after 2009 'b' have given women farmworkers $4 million'b'.'b'Yet these cases involve only a tiny percentage of women who work in agriculture. Research shows that harassment and abuse are much more widespread \xe2\x80\x94 and case-by-case litigation isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough to change that.'b'When women do file complaints, investigations can takes months, even years, which can discourage other women from speaking up. And even when a case is won, 'b'criminal prosecution of the harasser or rapist'b' rarely follows.'b'There are several steps we can take to slow this scourge. Education and outreach are critical \xe2\x80\x94 not just for women working in the industry, but also for consumers who can put pressure on the industry to crack down. At the same time, employers themselves often don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in their own fields.'b'Still, many employers do know \xe2\x80\x94 and use threats and intimidation to keep their workers quiet. We need stronger laws against retaliation, and protections for undocumented workers who come forward.'b'The administrative barriers to complaints must also be addressed. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has few offices in rural areas; they\xe2\x80\x99re usually open only when women are working; and the staff often don\xe2\x80\x99t speak Spanish, much less indigenous languages. What\xe2\x80\x99s more, many government agencies require complaints to be filed online. Many farmworkers do not have access to computers. The commission could make filing complaints easier by setting up a 24/7 hotline in multiple languages, with an actual person answering the phone, instead of automated messages.'b'Criminal prosecution of sexual assault cases needs to increase as well. District attorneys and state prosecutors must step in, making indictments and fining bosses who tolerate harassment. Women will feel safer filing complaints if they know their attackers can\xe2\x80\x99t just walk away. There has been some success along these lines, including a recent conviction in San Benito.'b'But perhaps the biggest impediment to fighting harassment in the fields is America\xe2\x80\x99s immigration policy itself. Federal regulations forbid legal aid organizations like California Rural Legal Assistance from directly representing undocumented people, and the illegal nature of their work situations makes it difficult for them to come forward. Finding a path toward documentation and legal employment for these women would also empower them to report those who rape and harass them.'b'Last year, California Rural Legal Assistance settled a $1.3 million case for a farmworker who was assaulted in a raspberry field, and then sent back to work in her bloody and ripped clothes. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the saddest thing that has happened to me in my life \xe2\x80\x94 for me it\xe2\x80\x99s like a wound that\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x9d our client said during the sentencing phase of the case. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to get out of this trauma.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lawmakers who oppose taking action to lower greenhouse gas emissions by putting a price on carbon often argue that doing so would hurt businesses and consumers. But the energy policies adopted by some American states and Canadian provinces demonstrate that those arguments are simply unfounded.'b'Around the world, nearly 40 nations, including the 28-member European Union, and many smaller jurisdictions are engaged in some form of carbon pricing. In this hemisphere, British Columbia, Quebec, California and nine Northeastern states have raised the cost of burning fossil fuels without damaging the economy. 'b'Alberta'b', Canada\xe2\x80\x99s biggest oil and gas producer, and 'b'Ontario'b' have said they will adopt similar policies.'b'Carbon pricing comes in two forms: a direct tax on emissions or a cap on emissions. British Columbia, for instance, has levied a tax on emissions from fuels like gasoline, natural gas and heating oil. California and Quebec, which are working together, place a ceiling on overall emissions and allow utilities, manufacturing plants, fuel distributors and others to buy and sell permits that entitle them to emit greenhouse gases. Like the cap itself, the number of permits decline over time, becoming more expensive.'b'Many economists regard carbon taxes as the simpler and more elegant solution, and cap-and-trade systems like the one that failed in the United States Congress as complex and hard to explain. But both systems effectively raise the price of using fossil fuels, which encourages utilities and other producers to generate more energy from low-carbon sources like solar, wind and nuclear power.'b'British Columbia, which is home to 4.7 million people, has placed the highest price on emissions in North America, taxing a ton of carbon emitted at 30 Canadian dollars, or about $21. By comparison, emission permits in California and Quebec are 'b'trading'b' at about $13 a ton. And permits sold for $7.50 a ton in a 'b'December auction'b' in the Northeastern trading system known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. That system covers emissions from power plants in nine states that include Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts.'b'British Columbia started taxing emissions in 2008. One big appeal of its system is that it is essentially revenue-neutral. People pay more for energy (the price of gasoline is up by about 17 cents a gallon) but pay less in personal income and corporate taxes. And low-income and rural residents get special tax credits. The tax has raised about $4.3 billion while other taxes have been cut by about $5 billion. Researchers 'b'have found'b' that the tax helped cut emissions but has had no negative impact on the province\xe2\x80\x99s growth rate, which has been about the same or slightly faster than the country as a whole 'b'in recent years'b'.'b'Meanwhile, jurisdictions using the cap-and-trade approach like 'b'California'b', the nine Northeastern states and 'b'Quebec'b' are investing the revenue generated by auctioning emission permits in mass transit, energy efficiency, renewable energy and other strategies to reduce carbon emissions. Some of the revenue is also dedicated to helping low-income families cope with higher energy costs.'b'In recent months, the leaders of Ontario and 'b'Manitoba'b' said they would join the California-Quebec cap-and-trade system. In October, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York said he was interested in 'b'linking'b' the Northeastern system to the California-Quebec trading platform.'b'In Alberta, a new government announced in November that it would impose a tax of 30 Canadian dollars on most greenhouse gas emissions by the 'b'start of 2018'b'. The province\xe2\x80\x99s leaders also said they would phase out the use of 'b'coal power plants'b' and impose caps on carbon and methane emissions from Alberta\xe2\x80\x99s oil and gas industry.'b'These actions deserve applause. But their real value may lie in providing a template for the rest of the world. Broad participation is essential to keeping warming below a point of no return; as a practical matter, it is also essential to keep companies from moving their operations to nations that do not impose a cost on carbon emissions.'b'In that context, China\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'announcement last year'b' that it would set up a national cap-and-trade system was hugely encouraging \xe2\x80\x94 the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest emitter agreeing to tax itself to help solve a problem that, only a few years ago, it barely acknowledged. Yet Congress has refused to act even as it becomes clear that putting a price on greenhouse gas emissions is the most direct and cost-effective way to address climate change.'b'A vaguely written \xe2\x80\x9cgay propaganda\xe2\x80\x9d law passed in 2013 created a toxic environment for gay men and lesbians in Russia. Now, some lawmakers want to further denigrate and stigmatize gay people. A new bill scheduled for debate on Friday in the lower house of Parliament would allow the authorities to impose fines and even jail time for public displays of affection between people of the same sex.'b'The law 'b'would criminalize'b' \xe2\x80\x9cthe public expression of nontraditional sexual relations, manifested in a public demonstration of personal perverted sexual preferences in public spaces.\xe2\x80\x9d If such displays of affection happen in educational or cultural institutions, a jail sentence of up to 15 days can be imposed.'b'Ivan Nikitchuk, one of the lawmakers who introduced the bill, described it as an effort to preserve longstanding social norms. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is our country, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve always respected traditions, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve always had and still have today a conscience and the concept of shame,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the 'b'Russian news site Meduza'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd all these bearded men kissing is nothing but nauseating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is not clear how much support the bill has, but its consideration can serve only to stir hatred toward people who are gender-nonconforming or gay. That further threatens a community that has faced widespread violence. Human Rights Watch 'b'documented a rise in harassment'b' of gay people and violent attacks after passage of the 2013 law, which outlawed promotion of what the government classified as \xe2\x80\x9cnontraditional sexual relationships.\xe2\x80\x9d The authorities in Russia have done little to prosecute hate crimes targeting gay people, many of whom have endured beatings.'b'President Vladimir Putin has not made it clear whether he backs the new bill. He signed the 2013 propaganda bill into law, but he has sought at times to dispel the notion that Russia has institutionalized homophobia. In the lead-up to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Mr. Putin sought to dispel concerns that gay athletes and spectators could be vulnerable. He 'b'later claimed'b', \xe2\x80\x9cWe have no persecution at all.\xe2\x80\x9d That, of course, was a lie.'b'Mr. Putin has said the propaganda law protects children from being exposed to behaviors he regards as abnormal. The new bill would take that preposterous rationale one step further and criminalize an act as harmless and natural as holding hands in public.'b'Allowing the bill to move forward would create greater peril for Russians who are already vulnerable.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'In \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Conservative Case for Solar Subsidies'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Op-Ed, Jan. 5), Ben Ho demonstrates that solar subsidies are not incompatible with a free-market philosophy.

In New Hampshire, overdose deaths linked to opiate abuse have 'b'more than doubled'b' over the past two years.'b'Ted Gatsas, the Republican mayor of Manchester, N.H., said he had had many opportunities to talk to Republican candidates, including Mr. Bush, Mr. Christie, Donald J. Trump, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Gov. John Kasich of Ohio, about the heroin and prescription-painkiller abuse in his state. He thinks that the overdose problem has been severely underestimated, not just in his city and state, but nationwide.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody, until you put the numbers and talk to them about it, knows that it\xe2\x80\x99s this bad across this country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Nearly 50 years into the \xe2\x80\x9cwar on drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d which both Republican and Democratic leaders have waged in various ways, with various disastrous outcomes, drug overdoses reached a 'b'record high'b' in 2014. From 2001 to 2014, the United States had more than a 'b'threefold increase'b' in deaths from opioid pain relievers, and a sixfold increase in heroin overdoses, according to the National Institutes of Health. During the same period, overdose deaths from prescription drugs like Valium and Klonopin \xe2\x80\x94 sedatives called benzodiazepines \xe2\x80\x94 increased by five times.'b'In speaking about their own experiences, Republican candidates are not only allowing themselves to be vulnerable in front of voters, they\xe2\x80\x99re also straying from the just-say-no message of Ronald Reagan, whose legacy includes a tough legislative stance on drugs and drug sentencing. They\xe2\x80\x99re also hoping that voters, especially in early primary states, will empathize.'b'Grant Smith, a lobbyist with 'b'Drug Policy Action'b', said it was remarkable how much airtime addiction was getting. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you look over the last two decades, we\xe2\x80\x99ve definitely seen a transformation in how elected officials talk about people who use drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s more empathy, less scolding. He is glad to see the new rhetoric about addiction, but notes that candidates have become more open about this issue as it has started to take a real toll on largely white communities.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no question that the shift in who is being impacted by overdose and the attendant harms of drug use to rural and suburban communities has made lawmakers as well as candidates for office more comfortable talking about these issues,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just that African-American communities have endured high overdose rates for decades, and few lawmakers in Washington cared.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At a forum at Southern New Hampshire University earlier this month, Governor Kasich 'b'spoke'b' with refreshing candor about what some call this \xe2\x80\x9cgentrification of addiction.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I wonder how African-Americans must have felt when drugs were awash in their community and nobody watched,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow it\xe2\x80\x99s in our communities, and now all of a sudden we\xe2\x80\x99ve got forums, and God bless us, but think about the struggles that other people had.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'So far, the proposed plans from the candidates to combat addiction have remained frustratingly vague. Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s plan is one exception: It would 'b'increase'b' access to drug courts, which allow some nonviolent drug offenders to undergo medical treatment instead of serving jail time, and would also reduce some mandatory minimum sentences.'b'Beyond criminal justice reform, there is the public health aspect of providing assistance. The Affordable Care Act 'b'requires'b' health insurance plans to cover treatment for substance abuse. The Republican candidates who want to repeal Obamacare should answer this question: If you succeed, how will you fund treatment for drug users?'b'Finally, there remains the problem of the government classification of different drugs. The Drug Enforcement Administration, formally if not informally, still 'b'considers'b' marijuana more dangerous and more addictive than the prescription painkillers and sedatives that accounted for more than 25,000 overdose deaths in 2014.'b'In Manchester, as Mayor Gatsas welcomes a parade of candidates, he also sees plenty of constituents dealing with the ravages of addiction. Mothers crying, parents writing obituaries that frankly state that their sons and daughters died from heroin overdoses.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith this epidemic, it\xe2\x80\x99s crossed every boundary. It\xe2\x80\x99s young to old, rich to poor, white to black,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell them, \xe2\x80\x98If it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t affected you yet, just wait. It will.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if it\xe2\x80\x99s a universal issue \xe2\x80\x94 which is something the candidates are starting to realize too.'b'Members  of the Republican governing class are like cowering freshmen at halftime of a high school football game. Some are part of the Surrender Caucus, sitting sullenly on their stools resigned to the likelihood that their team is going to get crushed. Some are thinking of jumping ship to the Trump campaign with an alacrity that would make rats admire and applaud.'b'Rarely has a party so passively accepted its own self-destruction. Sure, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are now riding high in some meaningless head-to-head polls against Hillary Clinton, but the odds are the nomination of either would lead to a party-decimating general election.'b'The Tea Party, Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s natural vehicle, has 'b'17 percent popular support'b', according to Gallup. The idea that most women, independents or mainstream order-craving suburbanites would back a guy who declares his admiration for Vladimir Putin is a mirage. The idea that the G.O.P. can march into the 21st'b''b' century intentionally alienating every person of color is borderline insane.'b'Worse is the prospect that one of them might somehow win. Very few presidents are so terrible that they genuinely endanger their own nation, but Trump and Cruz would go there and beyond. Trump is a solipsistic branding genius whose \xe2\x80\x9cpolicies\xe2\x80\x9d have no contact with Planet Earth and who would be incapable of organizing a coalition, domestic or foreign.'b'Cruz would be as universally off-putting as he has been in all his workplaces. He\xe2\x80\x99s always been good at tearing things down but incompetent when it comes to putting things together.'b'So maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time for governing Republicans to actually do something. Yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m talking to you state legislators, or local committeepersons, or members of Congress and all your networks of donors and supporters. If MoveOn can organize, if the Tea Party can organize, if Justin Bieber can build a gigantic social media movement, why are you incapable of any collective action at all?'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is a grass-roots movement that stands for governing conservatism, built both online and through rallies, and gets behind a single candidate sometime in mid- to late February. In politics, if A (Trump) and B (Cruz) savage each other then the benefits often go to Candidate C. But there has to be a C, not a C, D, E, F and G.'b'This new movement must come to grips with two realities. First, the electorate has changed. Less-educated voters are in the middle of a tidal wave of trauma. Labor force participation is dropping, wages are sliding, suicide rates are rising, heroin addiction is rising, faith in American institutions is dissolving.'b'Second, the Republican Party is not as antigovernment as its elites think it is. Its members no longer fit into the same old ideological categories. Trump grabbed his lead with an ideological grab bag of gestures, some of them quite on the left. He is more Huey Long than Calvin Coolidge.'b'Given the current strains on middle- and working-class families, many Republican voters want a government that will help the little guy; they just don\xe2\x80\x99t want one that is incompetent, corrupt or infused with liberal social values.'b'In addition, younger voters and college-educated voters are more moderate than party leaders. According to one of the smartest conservative analysts, 'b'Henry Olsen'b', somewhere around 35 to 40 percent of the G.O.P. electorate is only \xe2\x80\x9csomewhat conservative.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s needed is a coalition that combines Huey Long, Charles Colson and Theodore Roosevelt: working-class populism, religious compassion and institutional reform.'b'Years ago, reform conservatives were proposing a Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Club Republicanism, which would actually provide concrete policy ideas to help the working class, like wage subsidies, a higher earned-Income tax credit, increased child tax credits, subsidies for people who wanted to move in search of work and exemption of the first $20,000 in earnings from the Medicare payroll tax. This would be a conservatism that emphasized social mobility at the bottom, not cutting taxes at the top.'b'Maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time a center-right movement actually offered that agenda.'b'And maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s time some Republicans took a stand on what is emerging as the central dispute of our time \xe2\x80\x94 not between left and right but between open and closed. As the political scientist 'b'Matthew MacWilliams has found'b', the key trait that identifies Trump followers is authoritarianism. His central image is a wall. With their emphasis on anger and shutting people out, Trump and Cruz are more like European conservatives than American ones.'b'Governing conservatism has to offer people a secure financial base and a steady hand up so they can welcome global capitalism with hope and a sense of opportunity. That\xe2\x80\x99s the true American tradition, emphasizing future dynamism not tribal walls. There\xe2\x80\x99s a silent majority of hopeful, practical, programmatic Republicans. You know who you are.'b'Please don\xe2\x80\x99t go quietly and pathetically into the night.'b'If you think Congress is hopelessly divided on party lines on every issue, think again. When it comes to regulating \xe2\x80\x94 more precisely, deregulating \xe2\x80\x94 corporate America, Republicans and Democrats are all too eager to find common ground.'b'This week a bipartisan group of senators \xe2\x80\x94 four Republicans, three Democrats and one independent \xe2\x80\x94 is expected to introduce legislation that would slow and complicate the already laborious process by which federal regulations are issued and enforced.'b'The winners would be big banks and big businesses. The losers would be ordinary Americans who would be deprived of timely and effective protection from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other bank regulators, as well as from agencies that oversee consumer product safety, nuclear safety, investor safeguards, workplace rights and a host of other issues and activities. These agencies are supposed to work independently, with Congress providing oversight. Under the legislation, however, Congress would actively interfere in the rule-making process.'b'One provision would require that the Congressional Budget Office review and approve the costs and benefits of proposed rules. The C.B.O. has no particular expertise in regulation; its reviews could indefinitely delay the process. Besides, the rule-making process already allows for public comment on proposals as well as legal challenges to final rules.'b'Another provision would establish a commission of political appointees to advise Congress on regulations that should be modified or repealed. That would undermine the authority of regulators because it would effectively create a political hit list. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to review regulations that are on the books \xe2\x80\x94 and regulatory agencies routinely do so. Such reviews are aimed not only at relieving unnecessary burdens but also at strengthening regulations where necessary. Much of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, for example, is devised to create or improve rules authorized before the financial crisis but never properly developed or enforced. A regulatory review commission whose aim is to curtail or end regulation would be a step backward.'b'This is not what Americans need. Regulation is essential in today\xe2\x80\x99s complex economy, as demonstrated by the financial crisis and by a number of corporate failures \xe2\x80\x94 fatal ignition switches, poisoned food, environmental pollution, invasions of privacy. Proponents of deregulation invariably claim that regulation kills jobs, but lack of regulation has killed more jobs and people than regulation ever has.'b'The Democrats behind the effort are Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Mark Warner of Virginia and Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, joined by Angus King Jr., an independent from Maine. The Republicans are Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Rob Portman of Ohio, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Roy Blunt of Missouri. The group is trying to recruit more co-sponsors, especially among Democrats.'b'In an election year, it is tempting to take a tough line against regulation because it is an easy way to please corporate contributors. But an indiscriminate effort to delay and undermine the regulatory process is a public disservice, unworthy of support.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Owner of New Republic Puts It Back on Market'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Business Day, Jan. 12): The present owner of The New Republic, Chris Hughes, confesses that having bought the magazine less than four years ago to \xe2\x80\x9censure its survival,\xe2\x80\x9d he has now \xe2\x80\x9ccome to the conclusion that it is time for new leadership and vision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Members of my family and I owned the weekly journal of political opinion and culture for 38 years, in the last years along with some former students of mine at Harvard and a few businessmen who were also intellectuals.

Estranged for the last three and a half decades, the American and Iranian governments are talking and working with each other once again.'b'The 'b'implementation'b' of the nuclear deal and the lifting of sanctions on 'b'Iran'b', as well as the prisoner exchange, combined to make it a rare, hopeful day for Washington and Tehran. But Iran remains a powerful adversary of America across nearly all the conflicts of the Middle East. 'b'President Obama'b' and his successor in the White House will be tested by whether they can find the right balance between cooperation on nuclear issues and containment of Iranian aggression.'b'The deal will have multiple consequences. With the lifting of sanctions, Iran becomes a major player in global energy markets. It will also cease to be a political pariah in much of the world. Most important, a possible third major Middle East war has been averted and Iran\xe2\x80\x99s bid for 'b'nuclear weapons'b' stymied, at least for now. At a time of upheaval in the region, this is an unusual piece of positive news.'b'Despite criticism of the agreement from congressional opponents, there are clear benefits for American security. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'nuclear program'b' will be frozen for 10 to 15 years now that its plutonium production and uranium enrichment facilities have been largely dismantled. A vast majority of its enriched uranium has been 'b'shipped'b' abroad. Tehran will be subject to tight international supervision and monitoring.'b'The commitments made by Tehran\xe2\x80\x99s lead negotiator, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, will be difficult to disavow in the future without major costs to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s global reputation. If it tries to trim or cheat on its obligations, the world will be watching.'b'The return of diplomacy as a preferred tool of American strategy is another of the deal\xe2\x80\x99s most promising results. Mr. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry can take much credit. Their decision to engage in a risky two-year negotiation with arguably our most difficult regional adversary has paid off. By emphasizing the primacy of diplomacy in the wake of the interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq, Mr. Obama believes he is redefining American leadership in the world in a more constructive and realistic way.'b'Despite the nuclear deal\xe2\x80\x99s many promises, however, the road to a more normal American-Iranian relationship will be long and rocky. That is how I saw it when I helped to negotiate sanctions against Iran for the Bush administration a decade ago. It remains true today.'b'One immediate challenge will be to deal with two Iranian governments at once. Mr. Kerry pounded out the agreement with the American-educated Mr. Zarif, who was backed by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s reformist president, Hassan Rouhani. But real power still rests with Iran\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader, Ayatollah 'b'Ali Khamenei'b', a recluse who is supremely distrustful of all things American and closer to the hard-line Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps than to the reformists.'b'The guards corps\xe2\x80\x99s influence over Iran\xe2\x80\x99s national security strategy has been visible since the nuclear deal was announced. In recent weeks, Iran 'b'tested'b' ballistic missiles in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions and fired rockets close to American warships in the Strait of Hormuz. After detaining American sailors last week, Iran 'b'released'b' a demeaning video of the incident.'b'The guards corps is also driving Iran\xe2\x80\x99s continued support for Houthi rebels in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria and the bloody government of President Bashar al-Assad. It is the guards corps that may be tempted to cheat on Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear obligations and return to taking American hostages.'b'Dealing with these rival camps will be a challenge. Mr. Kerry is right to test whether Iran will be more cooperative in the negotiations to end the war in Syria and in the fight against the Islamic State. But the administration will need to be equally determined to contain the worst aspects of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s aggression in the region.'b'The president made a start Sunday by 'b'announcing'b' sanctions against Iran for its missile tests. Mr. Obama will also need to repair our damaged relationships with Israel and Saudi Arabia to limit the mayhem Iran may yet cause in Syria. He should also counter any Iranian attempt to encourage its clients Hezbollah and Hamas to resume rocket attacks on Israel.'b'This will be a difficult set of issues to manage in a polarized election year. Is it too much to hope that some G.O.P. leaders might drop their opposition and help implement the deal? Or that more Democrats will back a tough-minded approach to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s troublemaking?'b'One thing is clear: The United States will face a major strategic challenge from Iran this year and next. In order to realize the long-term benefits of this historic deal, the United States must continue to balance engagement with deterrence.'b'Some people cannot stand good news. It troubles their fixed view of the world. These would include Senator Marco Rubio, the Republican presidential candidate, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, who were cast into a huff by the confirmed reversal of 'b'Iran'b'\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'nuclear program'b' and its release of several Americans, including Jason Rezaian of The Washington Post.'b'Try a smile, guys. Toughness is no more than empty aggression when it will not admit to misjudgment. Diplomacy delivers.'b'Rezaian is coming home after a year and a half of groundless imprisonment. An American pastor and a former Marine will be reunited with their families. Iran had more than 19,000 first-generation centrifuges installed; that number is now 6,104. Its advanced centrifuges have been slashed from over 1,000 to zero. Its low-enriched uranium stockpile has been cut to 660 pounds from over 19,000.'b'The plutonium route to a bomb has been cut off. Iran is subject to what President Obama called \xe2\x80\x9cthe most comprehensive, intrusive inspection regime ever negotiated to monitor a nuclear program.\xe2\x80\x9d The country\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbreak-out\xe2\x80\x9d time \xe2\x80\x94 the period needed to rush for a bomb \xe2\x80\x94 has been extended to a year from two to three months.'b'The trauma-induced Iranian-American psychosis, ongoing since the birth of the Islamic Republic in 1979, has been overcome. Two tireless diplomats, Secretary of State John Kerry and the University of Denver-educated Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, speak when needed. American sailors who strayed into Iranian waters are released within 24 hours. A financial dispute outstanding since 1981 is resolved. The world\xe2\x80\x99s 18th-largest economy is about to rejoin the world at a time when the sinking global economy sure could use a jolt. The nuclear deal, even in these early days, is not hermetic. It opens doors.'b'To all of which Rubio responds that Obama has put \xe2\x80\x9ca price on the head of every American abroad\xe2\x80\x9d when he should have used \xe2\x80\x9ccrippling sanctions\xe2\x80\x9d (oh, please, not that crippled phrase again).

We can all go guessing in the Iranian bazaar. Nothing comes cheaper than an Iran pontificator.'b'What is clear is that Iran is much further from a nuclear weapon because of the courageous diplomacy of Obama and Kerry and Zarif and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who all confronted hostile constituencies at home to get the deal done.'b'For Iran, the arrival of \xe2\x80\x9cimplementation day\xe2\x80\x9d means the lifting of all nuclear-related sanctions and access to about $100 billion in frozen assets. A big nation is open for business again, back in the global financial system and world oil market.'b'Netanyahu, Rubio and their ilk believe Iran will use the windfall to do its worst. That cannot be discounted. The United States and Iran remain hostile on most fronts, from Syria to Israel. Revolutionary Guard hard-liners have not drunk the Kool-Aid at the Rouhani-Zarif school of diplomacy. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of mild new sanctions for banned missile tests was a reminder of differences.'b'But if the developments of recent days demonstrate one thing, it is that Iran, 37 years from its revolution, is delicately poised between hard-liners and reformers, neither of whom can dictate the country\xe2\x80\x99s course, each of whom need the other for now. Imminent parliamentary elections may indicate which camp is ascendant. Whatever happens, it is hard to argue that greater contact with the world will be bad for the large, modernizing, highly educated younger generation. Iran is a pro-American country with a tired anti-American refrain. It has a successful diaspora community ready to help revive the country \xe2\x80\x94 if allowed to do so.'b'The breakthrough with Iran is Obama\xe2\x80\x99s greatest foreign policy achievement, one that may have a transformative effect on the region. The next decade will show to what degree. That potential is what has American allies from Saudi Arabia to Israel so perturbed. They preferred the status quo.'b'Of course it could all unravel. Predicting Doomsday is easy. But with hard work, I believe the chances are greater that American-Iranian diplomatic relations will be restored within five years.'b'The Economist had a good summary of why Iran\xe2\x80\x99s reintegration is so important and consequential. It noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prospects in a post-deal Iran are vast.\xe2\x80\x9d The country is not \xe2\x80\x9can oil-soaked rentier state,\xe2\x80\x9d like some of its neighbors, but a \xe2\x80\x9cregional power with an industrial economy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 if a grossly mismanaged one. Its population of 80 million is well-educated, its oil and gas reserves enormous. The country\xe2\x80\x99s pent-up need for foreign investment may amount to $1 trillion. Iran, it concluded, is \xe2\x80\x9cpreparing for takeoff.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Try saying the word Iran without saying the word \xe2\x80\x9cnuclear.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s time. In fact, it\xe2\x80\x99s past time, even if good news is too much for some.'b'SINGAPORE \xe2\x80\x94 The attack that killed four civilians and four terrorists in central Jakarta last Thursday may be a harbinger of more violence to come. It certainly suggests that 'b'ISIS'b', which claimed responsibility, has already transformed the terrorism threat in 'b'Indonesia'b', after years of mostly foiled plots.'b'Indonesia, the country with the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest Muslim population, has a tiny jihadist movement relative to its size. Many factors have kept radicalism in check: a stable, democratic government, little internal conflict, peaceful neighbors and tolerance for advocates of Islamic law. It also has an effective counterterrorism police unit, set up after the 2002 Bali bombings.'b'The Bali bombings, which killed more than 200 people, marked the high point of terrorist capacity in Indonesia. The bombers were from Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), trained on the Afghan-Pakistani border and funded by Al Qaeda. Although those attacks were carried out in the name of the global jihad, most JI members \xe2\x80\x94 like many other local extremist groups \xe2\x80\x94 were focused on avenging the deaths of Muslims in Christian-Muslim fighting in two areas of eastern Indonesia, Maluku and Poso. The groups involved in that struggle in the late 1990s and early 2000s laid the basis for the extensive network of jihadist cells that exists in Indonesia today.'b'With the arrests that followed the Bali attacks and the end of local wars, the jihadist movement weakened and fragmented. But it did not disappear. By the mid-2000s, JI decided violence was largely counterproductive and redirected its efforts toward rebuilding its membership through religious outreach and education. Other extremist groups, some of them splinters from JI, remained committed to jihad, but they lacked JI\xe2\x80\x99s training regimen, indoctrination process and discipline. From 2010 until last week, out of dozens of attempted bomb attacks in Indonesia, not one bomb worked as intended, and three suicide attacks killed only the attackers themselves.'b'But then ISIS emerged, and suddenly there was the potential for Indonesian extremists to go to Syria and get military training, combat experience, ideological indoctrination and international contacts. What had become a low-level threat became more serious again.'b'Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s attacks were reportedly organized and funded by Bahrun Naim, an Indonesian computer expert said to be in Syria. Last August, three men were arrested in Solo, in central Java, for planning to bomb a police post, a church and a Chinese temple on Mr. Naim\xe2\x80\x99s instructions. (The temple was targeted as retaliation for Buddhist violence against Muslims in Myanmar.) In December, four more of Mr. Naim\xe2\x80\x99s men were picked up for plotting attacks against senior police officials and Shiite institutions.'b'Even as terrorist activity has picked up in the last year, Indonesia has been shielded from its effects by the incompetence of would-be attackers, as well as police vigilance. In 2015, the total death toll from terrorism was just eight people; in 2014, it was four. The terrorists of the Solo plot, for example, apparently couldn\xe2\x80\x99t figure out the right chemicals to make explosives. Last Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s attacks could have been much deadlier had the perpetrators been better trained.'b'This weakness could lead Mr. Naim or other terrorists in the Middle East to send operatives back to Indonesia to instruct local extremists. And if the Jakarta attack did not cause the mass casualties its organizers were hoping for, the saturation news coverage it generated may turn that near-failure into a success of sorts, and encourage more attacks. Other ISIS sympathizers in Indonesia may want to strike in the hope of attracting similar attention. The rivalry between the two men who are said to be vying for the leadership of Indonesian fighters in Syria, Bahrumsyah and Abu Jandal, could blow back to Indonesia in the form of lethal competition among their supporters.'b'The need for more preventive measures has therefore become pressing. One necessity is plugging the holes in Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s anti-terrorism law, which at present does not ban membership in ISIS or similar organizations, or participation in terrorist-training camps abroad. Even when the Indonesian police know that individuals are actively recruiting for ISIS, they have few legal tools to stop them.'b'Another necessary step is to improve supervision and post-release monitoring of convicted terrorists. Pro-ISIS networks are able to disseminate information and contacts in Indonesian prisons, in part because almost every inmate has ready access to a smartphone. At any one time, some 300 individuals are either in prison or police custody awaiting trial on terrorism charges \xe2\x80\x94 many of them still in regular communication with peers on the outside. Dozens are released every year after serving their sentences, and the state authorities do not monitor them afterward.'b'The government must also develop a program for deportees who have been returned to Indonesia. So far some 200 Indonesians who tried to join ISIS have been sent back by Turkish authorities, some 60 percent of them women and minors, and if there ever was a target population for a deradicalization program, this is it. These people, often especially the women, have proved their determination to go to Syria or Iraq, and they may try to do so again. Their whereabouts are known, at least for the moment, and many need assistance because they sold everything before leaving. The Ministry of Social Affairs provides them temporary shelter, but no structured program assists them beyond that. The Indonesian government must work with local civil society organizations to draw these people into new social networks.'b'Finally, Indonesia needs to engage young, computer-savvy Indonesians to develop anti-ISIS messaging on social media and online, where Mr. Naim and other radical groups are actively spreading ISIS propaganda.'b'So far, the combination of Indonesia\xe2\x80\x99s moderate majority, good police work and the incompetence of Indonesian extremists has kept the death toll from terrorist attacks low. But with ISIS now clearly present as a new threat, the government must urgently develop more programs to prevent its appeal from spreading.'b'A 'b'Hong Kong'b' publisher specializing in books banned in 'b'China'b' has disappeared mysteriously, sowing fear among Hong Kongers that the Chinese government is growing bolder about encroaching on their liberties. As the saga continues to unfold, Beijing is reacting bizarrely, and in ways that suggest that the story is the extension of a long-running power struggle at the highest levels of the Chinese Communist Party.'b'Mighty Current is an obscure Hong Kong publishing company that churns out gossipy titles about China and its top leaders. On Dec. 30, Lee Bo, 65, an editor at the company, received a phone order for a dozen books, including several about the private life of President Xi Jinping. That evening he went to get the books in a warehouse in a quiet part of town. He never returned. Two of the company\xe2\x80\x99s co-owners and two employees had disappeared before him, one after the other, beginning last October.'b'Within days of his disappearance, Mr. Lee called his wife, and faxed a message to colleagues saying he was \xe2\x80\x9cO.K.\xe2\x80\x9d and had gone to China \xe2\x80\x9cin his own way.\xe2\x80\x9d This was ominous, for his wife had found Mr. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s travel documents at home; she began to worry that he had been abducted and forcibly brought to the mainland by Chinese government operatives.'b'Concern deepened after the mainstream Hong Kong newspaper Ming Pao reported that the local police were in possession of footage from surveillance cameras at the book warehouse showing Mr. Lee being shadowed by strangers as he walks into an elevator. A witness claims to have seen him being forced into a car by several men and driven off.'b'Gui Minhai, one of Mr. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s missing colleagues, who left his home in Thailand under extremely suspicious circumstances a few months ago, appeared earlier this week on Chinese state TV, in China, looking sullen and mouthing an implausible mea culpa about voluntarily returning to the mainland because of a deadly car accident many years ago.'b'The case of the disappearing booksellers has touched a nerve in Hong Kong: Once again, the Chinese authorities seem willing to violate the territory\xe2\x80\x99s Basic Law, its mini constitution since 1997, which guarantees Hong Kongers various political rights, many unavailable in China. Those rights include freedom from arbitrary arrests, especially by Chinese law enforcement agents. They also include the right to eventually elect Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s top leader, the chief executive, by universal suffrage: It was Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to undermine that right that set off the Umbrella Movement in 2014.'b'Leung Chun-ying, the current chief executive, who is widely regarded as a Communist Party minion, has done little to quiet Hong Kongers\xe2\x80\x99 anxieties. On Jan. 5, hard pressed and visibly embarrassed, he appealed to Mr. Lee \xe2\x80\x9cto come forward and reveal what had happened.\xe2\x80\x9d Angered by this evasiveness and hypocrisy, several thousand people marched through the Central District of Hong Kong on Jan. 10, demanding that Mr. Leung press mainland authorities for an explanation.'b'The official response from the Chinese government has been baffling. Several articles and editorials in the Global Times, an ultranationalistic Communist Party newspaper in Beijing, have claimed that the Hong Kong publishers violated Chinese law and were subject to arrest for selling books banned in China that were then brought to the mainland. (Communist Party officials themselves are known to be avid readers of such political gossip.)'b'The Global Times has also argued that China\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive power-wielding departments\xe2\x80\x9d could resort to covert, extraterritorial enforcement so long as they did not \xe2\x80\x9ctie up a captive like a major criminal, manhandle him into a car and drive across the border.\xe2\x80\x9d The statement came across as another expression of the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s blatant disregard for the Basic Law, and it further fanned anti-Beijing passions in Hong Kong.'b'Then the story took an intriguing turn. Citing sources close to the central government, two Hong Kong newspapers in good standing with Beijing, Sing Tao Daily and the Hong Kong Economic Times, claimed that the Global Times did not represent the views of the Communist Party leadership and that its statements had damaged China\xe2\x80\x99s image.'b'Why would there be two conflicting accounts of the same story from known proxies of the Chinese government?'b'Perhaps because the very top of the Communist Party itself is split. During and after his long tenure as the party\xe2\x80\x99s general secretary and China\xe2\x80\x99s president, Jiang Zemin was known to be at odds with Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao, later the country\xe2\x80\x99s president and prime minister, respectively. Tensions carried over to Mr. Xi, who in turn became president with the backing of Mr. Hu and Mr. Wen.'b'Bo Xilai, a princeling and Jiang prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9, was purged during the final days of the Hu-Wen rule. After Mr. Xi became president in 2012, Zhou Yongkang \xe2\x80\x94 security czar, member of the politburo\xe2\x80\x99s standing committee and a Jiang man \xe2\x80\x94 was sidelined on corruption charges.'b'The Falun Gong\xe2\x80\x99s theology, or its claim that the Chinese authorities are harvesting human organs, may not be everyone\xe2\x80\x99s cup of tea, but the spiritual movement has often proved correct in its analysis of power plays in Beijing. According to a recent article in Epoch Times, a Falun Gong publication, even as Mr. Xi has tried to muffle so-called small channel news, political gossip supposedly leaked from the inner circles of the Communist Party, the Jiang faction has continued to feed Mr. Lee and his partners juicy stories about the Xi family.'b'Indeed, among the books Mr. Lee was picking up when he disappeared was one titled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Six Women of Xi Jinping.\xe2\x80\x9d (A previous marriage of Mr. Xi\xe2\x80\x99s ended in divorce, and his current wife was chosen from the cultural troupe of the People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Army, which is often derisively portrayed as a harem for top Communist Party officials.) Mr. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s wife was a long-time columnist at Ta Kung Pao, one of two official Communist Party newspapers in Hong Kong, which published gushing stories about Zhou Yongkang. (Her column was abruptly suspended recently.)'b'Of course, many Hong Kongers care little about the details of Mr. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s political connections. What matters to them is that his suspected abduction represents yet another attack on their freedoms, and yet another sign that the \xe2\x80\x9cone country, two systems\xe2\x80\x9d formula that supposedly protects Hong Kong\xe2\x80\x99s autonomy from Beijing is steadily being eroded.'b'The fear and outrage that is spreading in Hong Kong is feeding anti-Communist and separatist sentiments there. This should worry Beijing, and so should the condemnation it has received from Western governments. (Mr. Gui is a naturalized Swedish citizen, and Mr. Lee holds a British passport.) But the fallout was also so predictable that one wonders how China\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, supposedly grandmasters of strategic machination, went about this political calculus.'b'The Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s questionable management of its financial markets recently has already suggested that it is seriously disconnected from reality. And now it is using brute force to snuff out a tiny Hong Kong publisher of two-bit political gossip. Is the Communist Party simply becoming more ruthless in quashing dissenting voices, or is its political judgment slipping?'b'It was inevitable that the prisoner exchange with 'b'Iran'b' would be questioned as soon as it was announced \xe2\x80\x94 and not just by Republicans who mechanically assail anything 'b'President Obama'b' does. The notion of making concessions to a hostile adversary to secure the release of one\xe2\x80\x99s fellow citizens has always been controversial, pitting the innate longing to win their freedom against the risk that handing over money or releasing prisoners in exchange will only encourage the captors to seize more. This dilemma has bedeviled many presidents and governments through history, with no simple or single answer. In this case, President Obama did the right thing.'b'It was right because the negotiations that led to the prisoner exchange were part of a diplomatic process that also produced the landmark agreement on 'b'Iran\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear program'b' that has lessened at least one source of tension in a very dangerous corner of the world. Iran\xe2\x80\x99s release of its prisoners was not actually a part of the nuclear deal, but it was a conciliatory gesture signaling what the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, described 'b'on Twitter'b' as \xe2\x80\x9ca new chapter in our relations w/ the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'However much the Republican candidates would like to portray it as such, the Iranian case was far different from the kidnappings practiced by terrorist groups like Al Qaeda or the Islamic State, in which the goal is either huge ransoms or the perverse publicity of cruel executions. The United States, unlike some European governments, has long refused to submit to terrorist extortion. The freelance journalist James Foley, for example, was reportedly executed by the Islamic State in 'b'August 2014'b' after the United States refused to pay a 100-million-euro ransom.'b'There is no way to know whether Mr. Foley\xe2\x80\x99s tragic death prevented any other Americans from being executed \xe2\x80\x94 or whether paying a ransom would have saved his life. That is the terrible unknown that governments must confront in their responsibility to protect their citizens in an increasingly dangerous and complex world. But if there is a heart-wrenching logic to refusing to surrender to blatant ransom demands, the preferred option whenever possible must be to turn to diplomacy \xe2\x80\x94 as the United States did in the many prisoner swaps of the Cold War, including the one dramatized in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cBridge of Spies,\xe2\x80\x9d and as Mr. Obama did with Russia in 2010, and with the Taliban and 'b'Cuba in 2014'b'. And as he did with Iran.'b'The Americans released by Iran will not be the last Americans taken captive in some distant land, and President Obama will not be the last leader to anguish over how to set captives free. And the thaw with Iran might yet take an unwelcome turn. But in the meantime, we should celebrate the safe return of our fellow citizens and the diplomatic achievements of the president and Secretary of State 'b'John Kerry'b' in Iran.'b'In the week after the Dec. 2 'b'terrorist attack in San Bernardino'b' that left 14 dead, both the House and Senate voted on 'b'legislation to ban the sale of guns and explosives'b' to people on 'b'the F.B.I.\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated terrorist watch list'b'.'b'In case you\xe2\x80\x99re wondering if such sales are a bogus issue, the 'b'Government Accountability Office reported last March that'b' individuals named on the F.B.I. list had sought to buy guns or explosives 2,233 times during nearly 11 years between 2004 and 2014. Federal officials approved 2,043 of these sales, or 91 percent. The accompanying table illustrates the G.A.O. data.'b'In the report, David C. Maurer, the director of homeland security and justice issues at the G.A.O., wrote:'b'Who could be against a bill to keep pistols, rifles, assault weapons and such commercially available explosives as 'b'Tannerite'b', 'b'ammonium nitrate and aluminum powder'b', and potassium chlorate out of the hands of those on the terrorist list?'b'The answer is 'b'53 of 54 Senate Republicans'b' and 'b'every one of the 241 House Republicans'b', who voted on Dec. 2 and Dec. 10, respectively, against taking up legislation to ban those on the F.B.I. list from buying explosives or guns.'b'On one level, Republican votes against restrictions on weapons sales to terrorism suspects reflect the power of the 'b'National Rifle Association'b' and the more extreme 'b'Gun Owners of America'b'. These two groups have a tight grip on the Republican Party.'b'On another level, these votes illuminate a conservative orthodoxy that dominates Republican politics. In some way, this orthodoxy is analogous to the liberal orthodoxy known as political correctness.'b'In the current presidential campaign, Republicans have escalated their 'b'attacks on liberal 'b'dogma \xe2\x80\x93 including college speech codes, bans on hate speech, 'b'exclusionary language'b', 'b'trigger warnings'b' and 'b'sensitivity training'b'.'b'Not only are gun rights sacrosanct, there are conservative prohibitions against the acknowledgment of 'b'climate change'b'; opposition to abortion is mandatory; immigration reform is rejected; and top priority goes to tax cuts.'b'In a successful effort to secure compliance, the right has institutionalized enforcement through such groups as 'b'Americans for Tax Reform'b', 'b'Freedom Works'b', the 'b'Club for Growth'b' and the network of national and local Tea Party organizations. These watchdog groups ensure that Republicans toe the line, ready to foster \xe2\x80\x94 and finance \xe2\x80\x94 primary challenges against those who deviate from the party line.'b'There are adverse consequences for the nation in adherence to doctrinal conservatism.'b''b'A majority of economists'b' surveyed in 2012 by the University of Chicago found that, despite Republican demands for austerity, the $831 billion 'b'American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009'b' stimulus legislation significantly reduced unemployment. Every 'b'Republican in the House'b' voted against the bill on Feb. 13, 2009, as did 'b'38 of 41 Republican senators'b' on the same day.'b'Republican opposition to raising taxes, in turn, resulted in a decade-long delay before the enactment last year of 'b'long-term Highway Trust Fund legislation'b'. During the delay, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure continued to decay, with one out of nine bridges considered 'b'structurally deficient'b'; the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that airport overcrowding and delays 'b'cost the nation $22 billion annually'b'; and 'b'42 percent of major urban highways'b' were congested.'b'Similarly, Republican cuts to the I.R.S. budget have resulted in a loss of tax revenue. In an 'b'April 2015 speech'b', John Koskinen, the commissioner of the I.R.S., noted that over the previous five years, as the number of taxpayers has grown, the I.R.S. budget was pared by $1.2 billion (to $10.9 billion from $12.1 billion), its lowest level since 1998, adjusted for inflation. In addition to a sharp reduction in the quality of services to taxpayers \xe2\x80\x94 the I.R.S. in 2015 answered only 37 percent of taxpayer phone inquiries \xe2\x80\x94 Koskinen said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe drop in audit and collection case closures this year will translate into a loss for the government of at least $2 billion in revenue that otherwise would have been collected.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Republican rejection of climate change and global warming'b' is having a substantial impact at both the national and state levels.'b'In two votes on Nov. 17, 2015, for example, Senate Republicans voted by identical 49 to 3 margins to disapprove a proposed 'b'E.P.A. regulation of carbon pollution emissions'b' and an 'b'E.P.A. regulation of greenhouse gas emissions'b'. Two weeks later, House 'b'Republicans voted 231 to 10 to'b' disapprove the greenhouse gas regulations and 'b'231 to 2'b' to disapprove the carbon pollution emission guidelines.'b'It is more interesting to see how climate change opposition plays out in Republican-controlled states facing the brunt of rising seawaters.'b'In Florida, present and former 'b'state employees contend'b' that the words \xe2\x80\x9cclimate change\xe2\x80\x9d have been banned from state documents, although Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, denies any such edict.'b'In North Carolina, where communities along the Atlantic are threatened, the Legislature 'b'voted in 2012 to bar'b' the state Coastal Resources Commission from defining \xe2\x80\x9crates of sea-level change for regulatory purposes\xe2\x80\x9d before July 1, 2016. The real estate industry was a major backer of the legislation.'b''b'In Mississippi this year, Republican leaders'b' of the state House changed the electronic display board where the votes of members show up in lights.

Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s platform is that we can solve our most onerous economic problems if we just tax \xe2\x80\x9cThe Man\xe2\x80\x9d more.

Unless we go to negative interest rates, the best the Fed can do now is rescind the tiny rate hike made in December. Meanwhile, after all the vital government spending to stimulate demand after the 2008 crisis, there is no consensus in the country for another big round.'b'These what-ifs constitute the real policy landscape that will confront the next president.

The states should never have been allowed standing to sue in the first place, and their substantive claims are groundless.'b'There are more than 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States. No one, besides Donald Trump, believes the nation has the resources, or the will, to deport them all. The clearest solution is to focus on removing those who pose an actual threat to public safety while deferring action on most of the rest and helping them \xe2\x80\x9ccome out of the shadows.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2012, the Obama administration 'b'allowed young immigrants'b' who were brought here as children to be given work permits and be exempted from deportation, a program that has worked well. In November 2014, the president 'b'announced a plan'b' to offer work permits and a three-year reprieve from deportation to as many as five million undocumented parents of American citizens or permanent residents, provided they had no criminal record and had lived in the country at least five years.'b'Getting hardworking people who have deep roots in their communities out of the shadows isn\xe2\x80\x99t a new issue. In a 'b'1980 presidential debate'b', George Bush decried the harsh efforts to marginalize undocumented immigrants. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re creating a whole society of really honorable, decent, family-loving people that are in violation of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Mr. Obama, along with other reality-based politicians on both the left and the right, understands this, but congressional Republicans have refused to pass any meaningful immigration reform.'b'Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s pragmatic deportation exemption programs are well within his legal and constitutional authority. The Supreme Court 'b'expl'b''b'icitly stated'b' in 2012 that the federal government had \xe2\x80\x9cbroad, undoubted power over the subject of immigration and the status of aliens\xe2\x80\x9d under the Constitution.'b'But Texas and other states \xe2\x80\x94 mostly conservative ones along the southern border \xe2\x80\x94 immediately cried foul, and 'b'steered a lawsuit'b' to Judge Andrew Hanen of Federal District Court in Brownsville, Tex. Last February, Judge Hanen 'b'ruled in the states\xe2\x80\x99 favor'b' and blocked the president\xe2\x80\x99s action. In November, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit 'b'voted 2 to 1'b' to affirm that ruling.'b'In their brief to the Supreme Court, the states 'b'concede'b' that the president has discretion to enforce immigration laws in individual cases. But they argue he does not have power to alter the legal status of entire classes of people.'b'This mischaracterizes the president\xe2\x80\x99s actions. Presidents of both parties have long used their authority to enforce immigration laws selectively, so as to be \xe2\x80\x9cefficient, rational and humane,\xe2\x80\x9d as a group of former immigration and Homeland Security officials wrote in a 'b'brief to the court'b'. For example, both the Reagan and first Bush administrations provided relief from deportation to spouses and children of those eligible for legalization \xe2\x80\x94 a class of people whom Congress had expressly declined to protect in the 1986 immigration reform law.'b'Apart from the fallacious argument on the president\xe2\x80\x99s powers, the states have no standing to sue. Texas claims that it has that right simply because it thinks the president\xe2\x80\x99s orders would harm its economy. If the court were to accept this kind of claim, it would mean that any time a state or city opposed a federal action, it could drag that political dispute into the courts.'b'As Judge Carolyn King noted in her 'b'dissent'b' in the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, this argument \xe2\x80\x9cappears to allow limitless state intrusion into exclusively federal matters \xe2\x80\x94 effectively enabling the states, through the courts, to second-guess federal policy decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Congress should have passed comprehensive immigration reform years ago, rather than, say, 'b'threatening to impeach the president'b' when he took on the issue. Mr. Obama is wholly within his authority to make wise use of limited enforcement resources.

I received an advance copy. Titled \xe2\x80\x9cTurning the Tide,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s the work primarily of the Harvard Graduate School of Education, though scores of educators \xe2\x80\x94 including the presidents and deans of admission at many of the country\xe2\x80\x99s elite institutions of higher education \xe2\x80\x94 contributed to or endorsed it. Top administrators from Yale, M.I.T. and the University of Michigan are scheduled to participate in a news conference at which it\xe2\x80\x99s unveiled.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTurning the Tide\xe2\x80\x9d sagely reflects on what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with admissions and rightly calls for a revolution, including specific suggestions. It could make a real difference not just because it has widespread backing but also because it nails the way in which society in general \xe2\x80\x94 and children in particular \xe2\x80\x94 are 'b'badly served'b' by the status quo.'b'Focused on certain markers and metrics, the admissions process warps the values of students drawn into a competitive frenzy. It 'b'jeopardizes'b' their mental health. And it fails to include \xe2\x80\x94 and identify the potential in \xe2\x80\x94 enough kids from less privileged backgrounds.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really time to say \xe2\x80\x98enough,\xe2\x80\x99 stop wringing our hands and figure out some collective action,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Richard Weissbourd'b', a senior lecturer at Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s education school, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a pivot point.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Weissbourd is one of the directors of the school\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Making Caring Common'b' project, which produced the report. He\xe2\x80\x99s also the author of research that was one motivation for it \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, 'b'a survey'b' of more than 10,000 middle- and high-school students that asked them what mattered most: high individual achievement, happiness or caring for others. Only 22 percent said caring for others.'b'The new report contemplates how the admissions process contributes to that psychology and how it might be changed. Some of those alterations would simultaneously level the playing field for kids applying to college from less advantaged backgrounds.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cColleges spend a huge sum each year sending signals that influence the behavior of millions of students,\xe2\x80\x9d the report notes. Why not rethink those signals to reshape that behavior?'b'The report recommends less emphasis on standardized test scores, which largely correlate with family income.'b'It asks colleges to send a clear message that admissions officers won\xe2\x80\x99t be impressed by more than a few Advanced Placement courses. Poorer high schools aren\xe2\x80\x99t as likely to offer A.P. courses, and a heavy load of them is often cited as a culprit in 'b'sleep deprivation'b', anxiety and depression among students at richer schools.'b'The report also suggests that colleges discourage manic r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 padding by accepting information on a sharply limited number of extracurricular activities; that they better use essays and references to figure out which students\xe2\x80\x99 community-service projects are heartfelt and which are merely window dressing; and that they give full due to the family obligations and part-time work that some underprivileged kids take on.'b'Stephen Farmer, the vice provost for enrollment and undergraduate admissions at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, praised the report as consistent with his school\xe2\x80\x99s desire \xe2\x80\x9cto be humbler and more alert to the many ways in which people can stake a claim on a place here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said that the school had already, for example, downgraded the importance of \xe2\x80\x9cA.P. everything,\xe2\x80\x9d which doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily measure true ability or intellectual hunger.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust making people jump through hoops because we can \xe2\x80\x94 we don\xe2\x80\x99t want to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, especially when some hoops are so arbitrary that \xe2\x80\x9cwe might as well be admitting these people on the basis of their height or the size of their neck.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTurning the Tide\xe2\x80\x9d follows other reexaminations of the admissions process. A growing number of colleges have made the SAT or ACT optional. And late last year, more than 80 colleges, including all eight in the Ivy League, announced 'b'the formation'b' of the Coalition for Access, Affordability and Success, which is developing a website and application process intended in part to diversify student bodies.'b'Colleges are becoming more conscious of their roles \xe2\x80\x94 too frequently neglected \xe2\x80\x94 in social mobility. They\xe2\x80\x99re recognizing how many admissions measures favor students from affluent families.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re realizing that many kids admitted into top schools are emotional wrecks or slavish adherents to soulless scripts that forbid the exploration of genuine passions. And they\xe2\x80\x99re acknowledging the extent to which the admissions process has contributed to this.'b'But they still need to stop filling so much of each freshman class with specially tagged legacy cases and athletes and to quit worrying about rankings like those of U.S. News and World Report. Only then will the tide fully turn.'b'The United States and European nations lifted oil and financial sanctions on Iran on Saturday.'b'Tel Aviv \xe2\x80\x94 The Israeli novelist Dorit Rabinyan has hit the jackpot: First, her latest book, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Borderlife'b',\xe2\x80\x9d became an issue of fierce debate and controversy. Then it became a symbol of liberty and progress. And then, of course, it became a 'b'best seller'b'.'b'What spurred Ms. Rabinyan\xe2\x80\x99s good fortune? A bureaucratic decision of little importance. In December, the Ministry of Education decided not to include \xe2\x80\x9cBorderlife\xe2\x80\x9d on its list of required reading for the matriculation exams.'b'Many books are not included in the list of required reading for high school students, of course. But the decision to skip Ms. Rabinyan\xe2\x80\x99s book became an issue of national discussion. \xe2\x80\x9cBorderlife\xe2\x80\x9d chronicles a love story between a Jewish Israeli woman and a Muslim 'b'Palestinian'b' man. \xe2\x80\x9cMarrying a non-Jew is not what the education system wishes to endorse,\xe2\x80\x9d a ministry official 'b'said'b'.'b'The political brouhaha that followed was somewhat predictable. The head of the opposition, the Labor Party leader Isaac Herzog, said he had purchased \xe2\x80\x9cseveral copies\xe2\x80\x9d of the novel. Minister of Education Naftali Bennett of the Jewish Home party defended his ministry\xe2\x80\x99s decision by claiming that the book smears the 'b'Israel'b' Defense Forces. (It does not.) On the left, the decision to keep the book off the reading list became yet another sign of the looming end of our democracy, courtesy of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right-wing and religious factions. A representative from the left-wing Meretz Party called the Ministry of Education\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cracist censorship.\xe2\x80\x9d On the right, the attack on the ministry was seen as proof that the left does not care about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Jewish character.'b'Nothing in this war of words was particularly interesting on its own. But the incident brought to light Israel\xe2\x80\x99s confused approach to Jewish identity and the question of assimilation. It showed that many Israelis felt the need to adhere to one of two artificial choices: Either support banning the book or endorse marriages between Jews and non-Jews.'b'In some ways, this gets at a question at the heart of the state of Israel. Jews 'b'account for'b' one-fifth of 1 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population. Jews in Israel are a tiny minority in a vast Muslim region, and Jews in other countries are a tiny minority among Christians. The Jewish fear of demographic calamity is well founded and deeply embedded in the Jewish psyche. Jews know that in bad times they are persecuted, and so their ability to thrive as a distinct group is challenged. And they know that in good times, when Jews are welcomed and integrated, their ability to thrive as a distinct group is challenged in a different way.'b'The creation of a Jewish state was supposed to address both of these challenges, giving Jews a place where they are the majority in power, saving them from hatred and discrimination, and giving them a place where they are the majority culture, saving them from assimilation.'b'There have been complications, but as a rule, it has worked. Jews in Israel are safe from persecution and \xe2\x80\x94 unlike their brethren in other countries \xe2\x80\x94 do not assimilate. They can\xe2\x80\x99t assimilate because they are about 80 percent of the population, and they don\xe2\x80\x99t intermarry because the vast majority of other citizens of Israel are Arabs, with whom Jews have contentious relations. Also, marriage between a Jew and a non-Jew is not even legally possible.'b'This is a blessing for Jewish continuity \xe2\x80\x94 but apparently it\xe2\x80\x99s also a curse for Jewish self-awareness in Israel. When the flap over \xe2\x80\x9cBorderlife\xe2\x80\x9d forced Israeli Jews to take a position on the highly complicated matter of assimilation and intermarriage, many of them proved unequipped to deal with it.'b'On one hand were those who comically overreacted to a fictional story of unfulfilled love. Granted, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the first time the issue had come up. There have been occasional eruptions of hysterical responses to isolated incidents of interfaith relationships in the past. So, clearly, the fear of assimilation is very much alive in Israel. This suggests that many Jewish Israelis have forgotten that living in a Jewish state was supposed to rid them of this fear. If even a Jew in Israel cannot enjoy not having to worry too much about the Jewishness of his or her grandchildren, then one of the most compelling arguments for the country\xe2\x80\x99s existence becomes hollow.'b'On the other hand were those who proved unable to simultaneously reject the ministry\xe2\x80\x99s idiotic rationale for not including the book on its reading list while still accepting as reasonable the position that a Jewish state does not wish to encourage assimilation. Students should be exposed to controversial books, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the ministry\xe2\x80\x99s decision symbolized what bigoted country Israel had become. Many seem to have forgotten that a Jewish state is a place where the natural and healthy aspiration for Jewish continuity can and should be unapologetic.'b'But there was one person who refused the binary choice dominating the public discourse: Ms. Rabinyan. While she is no doubt a critic of many of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s policies, she is also a staunch Zionist. It is ridiculous for the ministry to try to portray her as a proponent of assimilation.'b'She didn\xe2\x80\x99t intend \xe2\x80\x9cto endorse romantic relations between Arabs and Jews,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me recently. She also said that she deemed it critically important to have a Jewish majority in Israel \xe2\x80\x94 a reason many Israelis, Ms. Rabinyan included, call for ending the occupation of the Palestinian population in the West Bank. Much like the conflicted love story in her novel, Ms. Rabinyan\xe2\x80\x99s nuanced response to the controversy surrounding it could serve as a good starting point for a discussion about Jewish identity \xe2\x80\x94 a discussion that the Jewish state seems to need.'b''b'Mosul Dam Is a Looming Disaster'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cIraqi dam, reclaimed from ISIS, now risks falling to neglect,\xe2\x80\x9d (News, Jan. 12): It has been approximately 16 months since the reclaiming of the Mosul Dam from fighters of the Islamic State; now there is a threat that the dam may collapse.'b'Efforts to contract the repair of the dam are proving difficult and the rainy season is fast approaching.

Perhaps the best example of this is the Munich agreement of 1938, when British and French leaders thought that Hitler would be satisfied if they gave him the Sudetenland, where the majority of the population was German.

Toney, Union, N.J.'b''b'Provost and vice president for academic affairs, Kean University'b'BENGALURU, India \xe2\x80\x94 The green benches of the lower house of 'b'India'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Parliament were mostly empty on the afternoon of Dec. 18. It was late in the winter session. An earnest but unhurried debate was taking place between Nishikant Dubey, a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, and Shashi Tharoor, a writer, former diplomat and opposition M.P., who was introducing a bill.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the vote was called, and a sudden clamor filled the hall, that the significance of the law became apparent: It proposed to decriminalize gay sex. Dozing M.P.s jumped to their feet and barked across the room. One voice was heard jeering, \xe2\x80\x9cTharoor only needs this bill for himself!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The final tally was 24 votes in favor and 71 votes against, and the bill was sent back to Mr. Tharoor\xe2\x80\x99s drafting table. Yet the debate itself was a hopeful development: Two years after sexual minorities in India were dealt a terrible setback by the Supreme Court, more elected politicians are stepping up for L.G.B.T. rights.'b'Unlike the courts, the politicians speak for constituents. Their statements come from and travel back to the hundreds of thousands of voters they represent \xe2\x80\x94 a national conversation that could do more than any learned court ruling to stop prejudice against L.G.B.T. Indians.'b'Mr. Tharoor intends to change Section 377 of India\xe2\x80\x99s penal code, a Victorian-era provision that punishes \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal\xe2\x80\x9d with life imprisonment. Convictions are rare, but the law is sometimes used to harass and blackmail gay men and transgenders.'b'In a country where every kind of sexual preference permeates cultural heritage and lived reality, Section 377 is both antiquated and incongruous. Mr. Tharoor\xe2\x80\x99s bill proposed to rewrite the provision, penalizing only intercourse with minors and nonconsensual sex.'b'For many years, the campaign against Section 377 focused on challenging the provision in court. And the strategy seemed to be succeeding: In 2009, an enlightened ruling from the Delhi High Court found that the clause violated the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s promise of equality.'b'But on Dec. 11, 2013, a panel of the Supreme Court reversed that decision, adopting an unusual position on judicial restraint. It was a bewildering abdication of the court\xe2\x80\x99s role as a guardian of civil rights, and devastating news for L.G.B.T. activists.'b'A few days later, I joined an angry gathering on the steps of the town hall in Bengaluru, the city at the heart of India\xe2\x80\x99s technology industry. Just one year earlier, the local Pride March had ended on these stairs \xe2\x80\x94 an especially colorful and buoyant parade, with veteran participants and fearless trans-folk joined by giggling tech geeks hoisting banners branded by Google and Goldman Sachs. After the Supreme Court decision, however, the protesters wore black, and chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re criminal and you know it, clap your hands!\xe2\x80\x9d The occasion was called the Day of Rage.'b'Soon, though, the insurgent anger mixed with astonishment at the outpouring of solidarity. On Twitter, even self-described \xe2\x80\x9cHindu far/extreme-right-winger patriot-capitalist-conspicuous-consumers\xe2\x80\x9d called for Section 377 to be revised by executive ordinance. The evening of the protest, the prime-time news shows were thundering against the Supreme Court decision, and inviting politicians to state their positions on it.'b'Through the gloom there was a glimmer of consolation: The action had just shifted out of the courts and into popular politics.'b'The first formal statement against the ruling came from the maverick Aam Aadmi Party, which had recently captivated the urban middle class with its campaign against corruption and politics-as-usual. It was followed by the Congress Party. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress\xe2\x80\x99s vice-president, said that sexual preferences \xe2\x80\x9cshould be left to individuals\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a mild but unprecedented statement from a leader of India\xe2\x80\x99s then-ruling party.'b'That declaration pushed the Congress\xe2\x80\x99 main rival, the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, to endorse the Supreme Court verdict. The B.J.P. won the 2014 general election, and today, after a year and a half in power, its leaders have softened their position on L.G.B.T. rights. At a literary festival in November, Arun Jaitley, the minister of finance conceded, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen millions of people the world over have alternative sexual preferences, it is too late in the day to propound a view that they should be jailed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Section 377 remains for now, and as Mr. Tharoor learned, India\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunctional Parliament is still some way from changing it. But the gradual accretion of support for reform from politicians of various persuasions is creating what a wise judicial decision might well have pre-empted: a national conversation about accepting and respecting different sexual lifestyles.'b'A progressive Supreme Court ruling would have revised the law all at once, but it would have done relatively little to change the social stigma and institutional hostility faced by sexual minorities. When major political parties affirm their support for L.G.B.T. Indians, it sends a different kind of writ to both their supporters and officials under their control.'b'In the spring, Mr. Tharoor will reintroduce his bill. He hopes that a full discussion in Parliament will be an opportunity to broadcast that L.G.B.T. rights are \xe2\x80\x9cnot about sex but about freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d The chances of the bill\xe2\x80\x99s passing are still slim, at least until the B.J.P.\xe2\x80\x99s more liberal voices prevail over the bigoted ones. Indian politicians can be expected to prevaricate, pass the buck or pander to religious conservatives in their base.'b'But some elected politicians have already begun to grapple with their responsibility toward sexual minorities, and thanks to the parallel efforts of activists, a small but growing legislative agenda for queer rights has become evident. A new bill protecting the rights of transgenders has passed in the upper house of Parliament and will be presented in the lower house this year. Last January, Madhu Bai Kinnar was elected mayor of Raigarh \xe2\x80\x94 the first transgender elected to run any Indian city.'b'Unlike in the United States, where L.G.B.T. rights are an issue too hot for many politicians to touch, in India homophobia is diffuse, and hardly features in our culture wars. And so the prospect grows brighter that Section 377 will eventually be changed through legislation \xe2\x80\x94 through a process that appeals not just to India\xe2\x80\x99s Constitution, but to its society as well.'b''b'The New York Times Opinion section presents three groundbreaking virtual reality films from the Sundance New Frontier lineup. These videos explore a range of topics and new approaches to nonfiction storytelling.'b''b'__'b'DANFUNG DENNIS'b''b'No matter how'b' enlightened any one of us may be, we are fundamentally limited to our own points of view \xe2\x80\x94 but it is human nature to try to broaden our perspective. For me, that\xe2\x80\x99s where V.R. comes in. I have found that the medium has an extraordinary capacity to convey the kinds of feelings of presence and place I\xe2\x80\x99ve always aspired to capture through photojournalism.'b'As a young photographer, I was transfixed by the iconic wartime images of great photographers like Robert Capa and James Nachtwey. Their vision of the world far transcended my own. Hoping to emulate their effect, I trained myself to follow in their footsteps, covering the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as a freelance photojournalist for The New York Times and Newsweek.'b'But I found that my photographs were not having the impact that I had hoped. There was something too abstract and flat about them, a quality that allowed anyone viewing them to remain distant from images of suffering. Frustrated by the barriers, I built a camera that could shoot steady, cinematic video in a war zone, and I made a feature-length film following a United States Marine in Afghanistan.'b'While the film provided a glimpse into the brutal reality of war, it was only a small window into that world. I wanted to go further, to pull people through that window onto the front lines and let them witness it firsthand.'b'I started the technology company Condition One in order to build a new camera to shoot in stereoscopic 3D, 360-degree video. We want to initiate a new generation of viewers jaded by flat images into the visceral emotions of being immersed in a whole new world.'b'The power of virtual reality is its command of presence \xe2\x80\x94 its ability to transport the viewer into another world, and have him feel present in it. These experiences are technically difficult to create and require significant computing power, but once presence is achieved and sustained, it is breathtaking.'b'One of the first tests I did with our prototype V.R. camera was leaving it in the path of a herd of wild American bison. When I viewed the result through a V.R. headset, I watched them walk straight up to me, snort in my ear and look me straight in the eye. I felt the strong presence of this massive animal, a descendant of a species that was once ruthlessly hunted to the brink of extinction. And I found that I cared about this bison in a much deeper way than I had before.'b'In V.R., we instinctively feel a surge of empathy for those whose experiences we are immersed in. The suffering of people in war zones becomes our suffering, just as the killing of animals in the wild and in factory farms becomes a source of our pain as well.'b'Referencing his own limitations of perspective, Einstein once wrote of grief, \xe2\x80\x9cOur task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Through V.R., we now have a chance to do just that.'b''b'Danfung Dennis is the chief executive and founder of Condition One.

There was no way they could study these findings in a controlled setting: You can\xe2\x80\x99t expose subjects to real violence. So instead they turned to V.R., building a scenario where a young man walks into a bar and finds himself violently confronted by a drunk hooligan supporting a rival team.'b'As I walked around the scene wearing goggles, I became deeply absorbed in the drama. Suddenly, I realized that the cable on my headset was straining as I tried to move closer in order to \xe2\x80\x94 intervene? Wow. It was like nothing I had ever experienced before.'b'As a journalist, I knew immediately that this was a space where important stories could be told. As a documentary filmmaker, I had often faced the challenge of having to build a visual recreation of an event from the past. And so I began to experiment: Could I use virtual reality to offer a better understanding of how events transpired, and to make people connect to stories they might otherwise ignore? Could I reach younger audiences who are accustomed to digital worlds and gaming platforms, and help them become informed global citizens? To me, these are the ultimate goals of journalism.'b'I dedicated the next seven years of my life to finding out, using sound as a foundation for storytelling. With my film \xe2\x80\x9cHunger in Los Angeles,\xe2\x80\x9d the first V.R. documentary shown at the Sundance Film Festival, in 2012, I used real audio from a food bank where a man waiting in the long line collapsed into a diabetic coma before he received food. At the premiere, I watched with amazement as my audience tried to walk around the \xe2\x80\x9cseizure victim\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground, while many emerged from the goggles crying.'b'I pushed further with \xe2\x80\x9cUse of Force,\xe2\x80\x9d using cellphone video to recreate a scene in which United States Border Patrol officers beat and Tasered a migrant to death. I brought a witness to a lab, where I motion-captured her bodily and facial movements while she recalled her memories of the night. Rather than watching a video of her telling you what happened, you hear and see her own re-creation through her body as much as her words. The story is visceral.'b'I kept experimenting with what this remarkable medium can do, concentrating on the kind of socially consequential topics that are sometimes difficult to keep an audience focused on with traditional journalism techniques. With \xe2\x80\x9cProject Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d you stand inside a thoroughly researched re-creation of a street in Aleppo as a bomb goes off. The segment is based on video and audio captured before and after the real event, photographs of the location and Google Earth maps. In \xe2\x80\x9cOne Dark Night,\xe2\x80\x9d about the shooting of Trayvon Martin by George Zimmerman, you see only the events that were documented by 911 calls, within a simulation based on architectural plans of the condominium complex and Mr. Zimmerman\xe2\x80\x99s videotaped police testimony.'b'We were able to push even further with \xe2\x80\x9cKiya,\xe2\x80\x9d a tragic story of a domestic violence homicide that you see here. In this film, two sisters try to save a third sister from being shot by her former boyfriend. It uses Freedom of Information Act material gathered after the homicide; interviews with the sisters and the police; and most important, recordings of two 911 calls that captured the entire sequence of events to re-enact a tragedy and bring new attention to the issue of domestic violence.'b'I have now seen tens of thousands of people respond to these pieces, and I know that they work. They tell important stories in an entirely new way, and they use the immersive power of virtual reality \xe2\x80\x94 its ability to generate intense empathy on the part of the viewer \xe2\x80\x94 to wring from the audience the intense emotional connection that these stories deserve.

Right away she understood the unique potential of V.R. to summon emotion in the viewer.'b'Through this medium, you not only hear Ms. Davis\xe2\x80\x99s story of survival, but you feel it. It is overwhelming, a physical force that radiates from her, detectable only by humans\xe2\x80\x99 sixth sense: empathy.

Even today, we are told that conservative solutions exist for persistent poverty, for joblessness, for the masses of people, like those in my hometown, who live lives of quiet despair. House Speaker Paul Ryan has been especially eloquent on this point. If only Republicans would get a chance to prove it.'b'That chance has arrived in a big way. Unfortunately, my party is not taking it.'b'For those not following this news \xe2\x80\x94 that is, largely my fellow conservatives \xe2\x80\x94 my hometown has been poisoned. For the last 18 months, the city\xe2\x80\x99s water supply has been contaminated with lead and iron. This was the result of a decision to use the Flint River for the city\xe2\x80\x99s drinking water until the city could hook up to a new water authority.'b'What began coming out of the tap was brown and smelled and caused some people to lose their hair or break out in rashes. Flint River water was so corrosive that it was leaching away lead in older pipes and contaminating the water. The health consequences of this may affect children, in particular, for the rest of their lives.'b'But very few people outside Flint cared, including the elected officials and public employees who, as part of their jobs, were supposed to care. Paid to care.'b'On Tuesday, Rick Snyder, the state\xe2\x80\x99s Republican governor, acknowledged that his government had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed\xe2\x80\x9d the city\xe2\x80\x99s nearly 100,000 residents. That is an understatement. His appointed task force reported late last month that the state\xe2\x80\x99s environmental agency had responded to those who tried to bring attention to this unfolding tragedy with a \xe2\x80\x9cpersistent tone of scorn and derision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No surprise there.

The location of one of the first sit-down strikes in the United States. The once proud home of General Motors. And it was where I was born and went to school.'b'My memories of growing up in that sad-sack town in the 1980s are vivid. Living near notorious drug houses. Being mugged for a bottle of soda when I was 12. Being stopped by the police at 16 because they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe a white person lived in my neighborhood. Even back then, Flint was considered one of the worst major cities in America.'b'In the decades since, nothing has seemed to go right. Because nothing has gone right. General Motors, the city\xe2\x80\x99s leading employer, left. Schools closed and crumbled. Most major grocery stores departed. Houses collapsed, as if the earth was slowly swallowing up the town.'b'We had the nation\xe2\x80\x99s highest arson rate and could afford only one full-time arson inspector. The city has long been listed among the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most violent. There were divisive recall elections and new mayors \xe2\x80\x94 almost all of them Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 were ushered in with new promises.'b'But the Republicans were never there, until 2011, that is, when the first of four state-appointed emergency managers was brought in by the Snyder administration to address the city\xe2\x80\x99s financial woes. The water switch was intended to save $5 million over two years. But even after residents complained about the water, and even after the City Council voted to switch back to Detroit for its water, the Snyder-appointed manager said no.'b'The truth is that Flint, where 40 percent of residents live below the poverty level, was never on the Republican agenda. Even now, when thousands of children subsist in a city that is toxic, this remains true.'b'But the Democrats are there \xe2\x80\x94 for better or worse, they\xe2\x80\x99ve always been there.'b'In the past few weeks, Hillary Clinton discussed Flint\xe2\x80\x99s plight in a nationally televised debate.

There were rallies involving the usual suspects \xe2\x80\x94 Jesse Jackson, the filmmaker Michael Moore and others.'b'Flint was not mentioned in the last Republican debate. Though Ben Carson, a Detroit native, on Tuesday blamed local Flint officials for the troubles, unless I missed them, no tweets in solidarity have been issued from other Republican contenders. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not an issue that right now we\xe2\x80\x99ve been focused on\xe2\x80\x9d was the best Marco Rubio could say when asked about the devastation of this American city.'b'This is the Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 chance to show their worth \xe2\x80\x94 the chance our leaders have said they always wanted. Why haven\xe2\x80\x99t they been here over the decades, running serious candidates, supporting federal aid for the city, championing pilot projects that might show what a conservative approach to urban areas might do? Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t they in Flint today, shipping in water bottles and holding fund-raisers for kids now condemned to lowered expectations because their brains were poisoned by lead?'b'It cannot be, as the left would tell us, because Flint has a large African-American population. Or that the city has always been a Democratic stronghold. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly a place Republicans should target.'b'I think it\xe2\x80\x99s because they are used to staying away. The party is accustomed to talking about policies and ideas to help urban America and then implementing them in safe, Republican-friendly areas like Idaho or Arizona. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to go to a place where nobody knows you or likes you. It\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to make change.'b'I do not for a moment question the sincerity of those voices in the party who call for a new approach to persistent poverty or who seek to welcome African-Americans and others into the fold. I don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible for conservatives to help a place like Flint. But first you have to show up.'b'Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders don\xe2\x80\x99t agree on much. Nor do the Black Lives Matter movement, the Occupy Wall Street protests and the armed ranchers who seized public lands in Oregon. But in the insurgent presidential campaigns and in social activism across the spectrum, a common thread is people angry at the way this country is no longer working for many ordinary citizens.'b'And they\xe2\x80\x99re right: The system is often fundamentally unfair, and ordinary voices are often unheard.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy (and appropriate!) to roll one\xe2\x80\x99s eyes at Trump, for a demagogic tycoon is not the natural leader of a revolution of the disenfranchised. But the populist frustration is understandable. One of the most remarkable political science studies in recent years upended everything rosy we learned in civics classes.'b'Martin Gilens of Princeton University and Benjamin I. Page of Northwestern University 'b'found'b' that in policy-making, views of ordinary citizens essentially don\xe2\x80\x99t matter. They examined 1,779 policy issues and found that attitudes of wealthy people and of business groups mattered a great deal to the final outcome \xe2\x80\x94 but that preferences of average citizens were almost irrelevant.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the United States, our findings indicate, the majority does 'b'not'b' rule,\xe2\x80\x9d they concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cMajorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One reason is that our political system is increasingly driven by money: Tycoons can\xe2\x80\x99t quite buy politicians, but they can lease them. Elected officials are hamsters on a wheel, always desperately raising money for the next election. And the donors who matter most are a small group; just 158 families and the companies they control 'b'donated almost half the money'b' for the early stages of the presidential campaign.'b'That in turn is why the tax code is full of loopholes that benefit the wealthy. This is why you get accelerated depreciation for buying a private plane. It\xe2\x80\x99s why the wealthiest 400 American taxpayers (all with income of more than $100 million) ended up paying 'b'an average federal tax rate of less than 23 percent'b' for 2013, and 'b'less than 17 percent'b' the year before.'b'Conversely, it\xe2\x80\x99s why the mostly black children in Flint, Mich., have been poisoned by lead coming out of the tap: As Hillary Clinton 'b'noted Sunday 'b'in the Democratic debate, this wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have happened in an affluent white suburb. Lead poisoning permanently impairs brain development, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not confined to Flint. Some 535,000 children across the country suffer lead poisoning, 'b'according to'b' the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.'b'Those kids never have a chance \xe2\x80\x94 not just because of the lead, but also because they don\xe2\x80\x99t matter to the American political system. American politicians are too busy chasing campaign donors to help them.'b'There are solutions \xe2\x80\x94 more about that in a moment \xe2\x80\x94 but a starting point is to recognize that this public mood of impotence and unfairness is rooted in something real. Median wages have stalled or dropped. Mortality rates for young white adults 'b'are rising,'b' partly because so many self-medicate with painkillers or heroin. Blacks have been protected from this phenomenon by another unfairness: Studies indicate that doctors discriminate against black patients and are less likely to prescribe them painkillers.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s political and economic inequalities feed each other. The richest 1 percent in the U.S. now own substantially 'b'more wealth'b' than the bottom 90 percent.'b'Solutions are complex, imperfect and uncertain, but the biggest problem is not a lack of tools but a lack of will. A basic step to equalize opportunity would be to invest in education for disadvantaged children as the civil rights issue of the 21st'b''b' century.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think any candidate seriously aiming to reduce inequality would have a mild increase in tax on the rich to fund higher school spending,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford 'b'expert on inequality'b'. I would add that investments in education should begin early, with high-quality prekindergarten for at-risk children.'b'We also need political solutions to repair our democracy so that ordinary citizens count along with the affluent. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no magic bullet that will set things right, but meaningful campaign finance reform must be at the center of a reform agenda,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilens says. \xe2\x80\x9cStates and cities are leading the way. Arizona, Maine and Connecticut have had statewide, publicly funded \xe2\x80\x98clean election\xe2\x80\x99 systems for some time with varying degrees of success.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One step toward transparency: 'b'President Obama could require'b' federal contractors to disclose political contributions.'b'Right now, the bitterness at America\xe2\x80\x99s grass roots is often channeled in ways that are divisive and destructive: at immigrants, say, or at Muslims. The challenge will be to leverage the populist frustration into constructive postelection policy. But it has been done before.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cReforms were adopted in the first Gilded Age, an era similarly plagued by government dysfunction, political corruption and enormous economic inequality,\xe2\x80\x9d Gilens notes. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps they will be again.\xe2\x80\x9d For the sake of our country, let\xe2\x80\x99s work for an encore.'b'On Wednesday, the 'b'Supreme Court'b' gave an important victory to regular Americans, ruling that companies may not avoid class-action lawsuits by offering to buy off the individual plaintiffs before they can establish a class of similarly harmed people.'b'The 6-to-3 decision was a surprising break from a long line of 'b'extremely pro-business and anti-class-action rulings'b' by the five conservative justices, led by Chief Justice John Roberts Jr.'b'Class-action suits are a critical type of litigation that allows people with relatively small claims to band together to hold corporations liable for wrongdoing. A single lawsuit by one individual is often not worth a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s time, even if a company has violated the rights of large numbers of people. That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s crucial to allow all those harmed to seek the same relief in a single suit.'b'Obviously, companies want to evade such litigation at all costs, and with the help of sympathetic justices they have devised all sorts of ways to do that. Over the last decade, the court\xe2\x80\x99s conservatives have consistently made it harder for 'b'consumers'b' and 'b'workers'b' to vindicate their rights, either by increasing the requirements for bringing a class action or by 'b'eliminating the option altogether'b' through 'b'strict arbitration clauses'b'.'b'This 'b'case, Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez,'b' started in 2006, when Jose Gomez received a text message from Campbell-Ewald, a company the United States Navy had hired to recruit young people who had consented to getting such messages. Mr. Gomez was nearly 40 at the time and had not consented. He sued the company for $1,500 \xe2\x80\x94 the maximum remedy under a federal law that protects people against unwanted telephone solicitations. He also began the process of bringing a class-action lawsuit to represent thousands of people who had been sent the same messages without permission.'b'Rather than fight, Campbell-Ewald offered to pay Mr. Gomez what he asked for, but declined to admit it had broken the law. He refused the money, and proceeded with his class action. The company argued that its offer ended the lawsuit, and thus the basis for a class action, since there was no longer any controversy for a court to rule on.'b'The Supreme Court disagreed. In an 'b'opinion'b' written by Justice 'b'Ruth Bader Ginsburg'b', the court ruled that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s legal claim is not voided if he or she does not accept a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offer, even if the offer is exactly what the plaintiff requested. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a plaintiff rejects such an offer \xe2\x80\x94 however good the terms \xe2\x80\x94 her interest in the lawsuit remains just what it was before. And so too does the court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to grant her relief,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Ginsburg wrote.'b'This was the right outcome. Had the court ruled the other way, it would have allowed companies to make settlement offers just to head off class-action suits \xe2\x80\x94 preventing many class actions from ever getting through the courthouse door. Chief Justice Roberts, who was joined in dissent by Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito Jr., was not concerned with deeply damaging the class-action process. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the defendant is willing to give the plaintiff everything he asks for, there is no case or controversy to adjudicate, and the lawsuit is moot,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. But following that reasoning \xe2\x80\x9cwould place the defendant in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Ginsburg replied, since it costs a company virtually nothing to pay off an individual plaintiff.'b'The court left open the question of whether a company could still dodge liability by depositing the full amount of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim in an account, leading a trial court to rule in favor of the plaintiff. Under the logic of Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, the justices should close that loophole when corporations try to exploit it and protect what remains of the class action from the unrelenting efforts of business to undermine it.'b'IN his vitriolic dissent last June from the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'same-sex marriage decision'b', Justice Antonin Scalia accused the majority of having carried out a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial putsch.\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Scalia should know. He and his four conservative colleagues were then in the process of executing one themselves.'b'On June 30, four days after handing down the marriage decision, Obergefell v. Hodges, the court announced that it would hear a major challenge to the future of public-employee labor unions. That case, 'b'Friedrichs v. California Teachers Association'b', was argued last week. As was 'b'widely reported'b', the outcome appears foreordained: the court will vote 5 to 4 to overturn 'b'a precedent'b' that for 39 years has permitted public-employee unions to charge nonmembers a \xe2\x80\x9cfair-share\xe2\x80\x9d fee representing the portion of union dues that go to representing all employees in collective bargaining and grievance proceedings. As the exclusive bargaining agent, a union has a legal duty to represent everyone in the unit, whether members or not; the fee addresses the problem of \xe2\x80\x9cfree riders\xe2\x80\x9d and the resentment engendered by those who accept the union\xe2\x80\x99s help while letting their fellow workers foot the bill.'b'The stakes are obviously high for the millions of workers and thousands of contracts covered by these arrangements in the 23 states that now permit them. If the court accepts the argument that the mandatory fees amount to compelled speech in violation of the objecting employees\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment rights, public-employee unions would forfeit hundreds of millions of dollars in dues revenue. New York and 20 other states filed a brief in support of California, which is defending its fair-share system, to argue that these provisions \xe2\x80\x9care important to ensuring a stable collective-bargaining partner with the wherewithal to help devise workplace arrangements that promote labor peace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I want to focus here, however, not on the implications the Friedrichs case holds for the public workplace, but on what it means for the Supreme Court. Actually, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t express my concern better than Justice Stephen G. Breyer did last week when he questioned Michael A. Carvin, the lawyer for the 10 California teachers who are challenging the state\xe2\x80\x99s labor law. Justice Breyer was referring to the compromise at the heart of the 1977 precedent, Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, that Mr. Carvin was asking the court to overrule. The court in that case upheld the constitutionality of the fair-share fee as long as it was limited to the union\xe2\x80\x99s collective-bargaining expenses and did not subsidize the union\xe2\x80\x99s political or other \xe2\x80\x9cnonchargeable\xe2\x80\x9d activities.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, in your mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Breyer asked Mr. Carvin, \xe2\x80\x9cthat you can say from the point of view of this court\xe2\x80\x99s role in this society in that if \xe2\x80\x94 of course, we can overrule a compromise that was worked out over 40 years and has lasted reasonably well \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d The justice ruminated for a moment on his own practice of filing dissenting opinions, and then returned to his point: \xe2\x80\x9cYou start overruling things, what happens to the country thinking of us as a kind of stability in a world that is tough because it changes a lot?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed. Exactly seven years ago, in a public-employee labor case from Maine, Justice Breyer wrote an opinion that cited the Abood decision and included this sentence: \xe2\x80\x9cThe First Amendment permits the government to require both public sector and private sector employees who do not wish to join a union designated as the exclusive collective-bargaining representative at their unit of employment to pay that union a service fee as a condition of their continued employment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The opinion continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe court has determined that the First Amendment burdens accompanying the payment requirement are justified by the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing free riding by nonmembers who benefit from the union\xe2\x80\x99s collective bargaining activities and in maintaining peaceful labor relations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The case was 'b'Locke v. Karass'b'. The decision was unanimous.'b'What changed since 2009? How could the court go from unquestioning acceptance of a long-lived precedent to a situation in which all that remains in doubt is whether that same precedent will be overturned in early June or late June? In the answer to that question lie some disturbing observations about the Roberts court.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s no secret that in recent years, major segments of the Republican Party have declared open season on public employee unions \xe2\x80\x94 selectively, of course. Police unions and correctional officers\xe2\x80\x99 unions, which have stood in the way of reform-minded policy initiatives in states and cities across the country, have been exempt as targets. Conservative and Tea Party ire has instead been focused on teachers\xe2\x80\x99 unions. It\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'not an accident'b' that when Mr. Carvin (a leading figure behind the two failed challenges to the Affordable Care Act) and the right-wing foundations supporting his lawsuit set out to recruit plaintiffs, they looked for teachers and not prison guards.'b'Reading the 'b'transcript'b' of last week\xe2\x80\x99s argument, I felt as though I had stumbled into the inner sanctum of 'b'Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s union-busting governor'b', Scott Walker. Both Justice Scalia and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy suggested that when it comes to public employment, there can be no real distinction between a union\xe2\x80\x99s workplace activities and its political activities.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is that everything that is collectively bargained with the government is within the political sphere, almost by definition,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Scalia said, addressing Edward C. Dumont, California\xe2\x80\x99s solicitor general.'b'Justice Kennedy elaborated at length: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s almost axiomatic. When you are dealing with a governmental agency, many critical points are matters of public concern. And is it not true that many teachers strongly, strongly disagree with the union position on teacher tenure, on merit pay, on merit promotion, on classroom size?\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cThe term is \xe2\x80\x98free rider.\xe2\x80\x99 The union basically is making these teachers \xe2\x80\x98compelled riders\xe2\x80\x99 for issues on which they strongly disagree.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s about as unconstrained and revealing a rant as I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the Supreme Court bench. It happens also to be based on some false premises. California labor law does not in fact permit collective bargaining over teacher tenure or standards for termination or budget-driven layoffs. I\xe2\x80\x99m no expert on California labor law; I read it in the 'b'union\xe2\x80\x99s brief'b'. But the details hardly matter. What matters is the glaring anti-union animus and the obvious fact that if everything a public employee union does is deemed political, the Abood compromise, based on a distinction between collective-bargaining activities and everything else, necessarily collapses.'b'And what exactly is it about the California teachers union\xe2\x80\x99s activities that the plaintiffs find objectionable? Impossible to say. The initial complaint referred only to their dislike of \xe2\x80\x9cmany of the union\xe2\x80\x99s public policy positions, including positions taken in collective bargaining,\xe2\x80\x9d but the plaintiffs refused to be more specific or to cooperate with the union in developing an evidentiary record. Instead, the plaintiffs under Mr. Carvin\xe2\x80\x99s direction sought to lose the case as quickly as possible, to speed it on its way to the Supreme Court. They asked the Federal District Court to rule against them, which it did, and they then asked the United States Court of Appeals to affirm that negative judgment, which it promptly did in a two-page summary opinion, observing that the outcome was \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned by controlling Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To call this litigation pathway unusual is an understatement. But it was hardly a shot in the dark. In majority opinions in 'b'2012'b' and again in 2014, Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. \xe2\x80\x94 yes, the same Justice Alito who signed Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion back in 2009 \xe2\x80\x94 suggested that he was ready and willing to revisit the Abood precedent. In the more recent case, 'b'Harris v. Quinn'b', he called Abood \xe2\x80\x9ctroubling\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cquestionable on several grounds.\xe2\x80\x9d But neither of those two cases offered a target for a direct hit. The current case was manufactured to serve that role.'b'If the political atmosphere surrounding public employee unions has changed, so has the court\xe2\x80\x99s vision of the role of the First Amendment. The court issued the 'b'Citizens United decision'b', with its embrace of a First Amendment right to unlimited corporate (and union) political spending, a year to the day after Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in the Maine labor case. In the intervening six years, the Roberts court has waved the First Amendment banner ever higher to undermine long-accepted governmental regulatory authority. Not too long ago, it was federalism \xe2\x80\x94 states\xe2\x80\x99 rights \xe2\x80\x94 that seemed to energize conservatives on the Supreme Court. The Abood regime is in fact more than respectful of states\xe2\x80\x99 rights: states are enabled but not required to adopt a fair-share fee system, and 22 states have chosen against it. But federalism can\xe2\x80\x99t save the unions from the ever more powerful First Amendment.'b'So what we have here are the majority\xe2\x80\x99s policy preferences conveniently clad in First Amendment armor. But even the best armor is vulnerable, and as the court strides recklessly into a danger zone, I\xe2\x80\x99m left with Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s question: What\xe2\x80\x99s the country to think?'b'In November, I was the guest speaker at the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s annual dinner. Before I spoke, the group called to the stage a longtime investigative journalist who had done tremendous work bringing the Flint water crisis to light. His name was Curt Guyette. He, in turn, recognized the scientists, doctors, politician, lawyers and activists who had helped in that quest.'b'I was embarrassed to admit that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t heard about this crisis before that night, but the details they laid out hit me with the force of a train.'b'Local officials made the decision to switch the city\xe2\x80\x99s water supply in 2014 from its longtime source supplied by the city of Detroit, which contained corrosion-control chemicals, to the Flint River, which did not contain those chemicals. It was billed as a cost-saving measure for a city facing financial distress.'b'But the Flint River water corroded the city\xe2\x80\x99s pipes and leached poisonous metals into the city\xe2\x80\x99s water supply, including lead, which is particularly dangerous if consumed by children or pregnant women.'b'Some of the water 'b'tested so high for lead contamination'b' that it was \xe2\x80\x9cmore than twice the amount at which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency classifies water as hazardous waste,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Guyette.'b''b'According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo safe blood lead level in children has been identified. Lead exposure can affect nearly every system in the body. Because lead exposure often occurs with no obvious symptoms, it frequently goes unrecognized.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The residents of Flint consumed this poisonous water, knowing that something was wrong because of its changing colors and smells, but mostly unaware of just how dangerous it was.'b'An entire American city exposed to poisoned water. How could this be?'b'It is hard to imagine this happening in a city that didn\xe2\x80\x99t have Flint\xe2\x80\x99s demographic profile \xe2\x80\x94 mostly black and disproportionately poor.'b'And, it got worse: Officials apparently kept assuring residents that things were under control, even though many residents knew intuitively that they were not.'b'As The New York Times 'b'reported in October'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll along, through months of complaints from residents of this city about the peculiar colors and odors they said were coming from their faucets, the overriding message from the authorities here was that the water would be just fine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And not only did the city not respond quickly, according to Guyette\xe2\x80\x99s reporting, it artificially suppressed finding on lead levels, and when the federal Environmental Protection Agency offered to help remedythe problem, city officials apparently declined the help.'b'The damage done by this misguided decision, and the callous apathy on the part of officials to quickly admit their error and work expeditiously to correct it, displays a staggering level of ineptitude, if not criminal negligence.'b'Lawsuits are sure to spring up by the thousand. It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear whether anyone will be held criminally responsible, but it is highly likely that civil suits for damages could be successful, so much so that they could bring the state to its knees.'b'The possible damage seems almost incalculable and one can imagine that a jury would find that the monetary damages should match.'b'I have not stopped thinking about Flint since November, and now the story has gained new urgency as it has become a cause celebre and entered the national political debate.'b'Bernie Sanders has called for the resignation of Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan, 'b'saying in a statement'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no excuses. The governor long ago knew about the lead in Flint\xe2\x80\x99s water. He did nothing. As a result, hundreds of children were poisoned. Thousands may have been exposed to potential brain damage from lead. Governor Snyder should resign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hillary Clinton has condemned the Snyder administration, called for the federal government to \xe2\x80\x9cstep up\xe2\x80\x9d in the crisis and 'b'dispatched two top campaign aides'b' to meet with Flint\xe2\x80\x99s mayor.'b'(On Tuesday that mayor, Karen Weaver, 'b'endorsed Clinton for president'b'.)'b'The Rev. Jesse Jackson 'b'said Sunday of the situation'b' that the city should have tape around it \xe2\x80\x9cbecause Flint is a crime scene.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Celebrities, including P. Diddy and Magic Johnson, have 'b'expressed their outrage'b', and some, like Cher and Meek Mill, have pledged 'b'large donations of water'b' to the city.'b'The Flint native Michael Moore, in an online petition, demanded that President Obama visit the city when he went to Michigan on Wednesday, 'b'writing'b':'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis week, you are coming to Michigan to attend the Detroit Auto Show. We implore you to come to Flint, less than an hour\xe2\x80\x99s drive north of Detroit. Do not ignore this tragedy taking place every day. This may be Gov. Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s Katrina, but it will become your Bush-Flying-Over-New Orleans Moment if you come to Michigan and then just fly away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'(Obama did not go to Flint during his visit to the state, but 'b'did address it while there'b', and met with the mayor of Flint in Washington the day before.)'b'Snyder conceded Monday that the Flint water crisis was 'b'indeed his Katrina'b' and on Tuesday, during a State of the State address, 'b'apologized for the crisis'b'.'b'But Moore tweeted a response Tuesday that might well capture the outrage many feel about this story:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn Sat, I called Flint \xe2\x80\x98Governor Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s Katrina.\xe2\x80\x99 Today he said he accepts that comparison. Except Bush didn\xe2\x80\x99t cause the hurricane. 'b'#'b'Jail'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gov. Matt Bevin of Kentucky is 'b'dismantling'b' the state\xe2\x80\x99s highly successful exchange on which people buy private 'b'health insurance'b' policies or enroll in 'b'Medicaid'b' under the Affordable Care Act. His shortsighted and pointless show of defiance against the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s health care reforms could harm thousands of people in Kentucky, who may fall between the cracks as the state shifts their coverage from its own exchange, known as Kynect, to the federally run exchange at 'b'HealthCare.gov'b'.'b'If Mr. Bevin, a Republican, wanted to take a stand against cooperation with the federal government, he picked an odd way to do it. He is shutting down an independent state program and turning instead to the federal government to run the exchange. While the federal website appears to be working well, the transition to a different system could cause problems.'b'The Kentucky exchange has made it extremely easy for people to enroll in a plan appropriate for them. If someone tries to sign up for private insurance but is judged by the exchange to be poor enough to qualify for Medicaid, the application is forwarded to Medicaid, which enrolls the person. If someone tries to sign up for Medicaid but is deemed ineligible by that program, the application is forwarded to the exchange for enrollment.'b'With the switch from Kynect to HealthCare.gov, the transfer of electronic information from the exchange to Medicaid is likely to be cumbersome, at least initially. People rejected by the exchange will need to submit a new application to Medicaid; some may not realize their information was not automatically forwarded or could get annoyed by the process and end up uninsured. Mr. Bevin needs to put a very high priority on providing a smooth exchange of information and enough enrollment assistants to help people find the right coverage.'b'The more vexing issue is what Mr. Bevin will do about Medicaid, which has enrolled far more people in Kentucky since its expansion in January 2014 than have the private plans sold on Kynect. The previous governor, a Democrat, had greatly expanded the Medicaid program with the help of very generous federal matching funds. Mr. Bevin, however, campaigned on a pledge to \xe2\x80\x9cscale back\xe2\x80\x9d the Medicaid expansion (by how much, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t say). Now he says he will apply for a waiver from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to administer the program using conservative approaches, like charging certain Medicaid patients premiums or co-pays.'b'Kentucky received $290 million in federal grants to build Kynect, of which $57 million has not yet been spent. Federal officials have suggested that the state should repay the $57 million. But surely a state that is willfully destroying an exchange that was working well should be forced to return the whole $290 million.'b'Sarah Palin is really falling apart.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy, it has exposed not just that tragic, the ramifications of that betrayal of a transformation of our country, but too, he has exposed the complicity on both sides of the aisle that has enabled it, O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d Palin told the crowd at her big announcement endorsing Donald Trump.'b'The man himself was standing next to her, with a half-smile. Hard to tell if it was self-satisfaction or the look someone might get when trapped at a dinner party next to a stranger who\xe2\x80\x99s describing how she met President William Henry Harrison in a past life.'b'Even though Palin seemed to have a script, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t help. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is from the private sector, not a politician. Can I get a hallelujah? Where in the private sector you actually have to balance budgets in order to prioritize, to keep the main thing, the main thing, and he knows the main thing,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued.'b'Got that? It\xe2\x80\x99s been quite a while since the world outside the Tea Party has checked in on Sarah Palin, but I think it\xe2\x80\x99s safe to say there hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been a whole lot of personal growth. The absolute high point of her rather long, rambling address was the moment when she complained that the United States pays for Middle Eastern \xe2\x80\x9csquirmishes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The next day, Palin spoke at another Trump rally, where she appeared to blame Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s veterans policy for her son\xe2\x80\x99s domestic violence arrest this week. Republicans seem currently O.K. with blaming the president for anything, including sunspots. But even some of them must have found it a little creepy.'b'Still, Trump has been having a super week. Palin wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even the high point. That came when Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s six-term Republican governor, Terry Branstad, urged voters to reject Trump\xe2\x80\x99s main competitor, Ted Cruz.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTed Cruz is ahead right now. But what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is, we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to do is educate the people of Iowa. He is the biggest opponent of renewable fuels,\xe2\x80\x9d Branstad told a press conference.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRenewable fuels\xe2\x80\x9d is code for the government ethanol program, which has been stupendously profitable for the Iowa corn industry. Cruz has broken one of the great traditions of the Iowa caucus (First in the Nation! Forever!), which is that every major presidential candidate falls down to worship Big Corn.'b'Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s many, many corn farmers have always gotten lots of government aid \xe2\x80\x94 the Environmental Working Group says that between 1995 and 2012, they received more than $15 billion in subsidies. On top of that, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got the ethanol program, which requires gasoline to be mixed with biofuel, usually corn. This causes corn prices to soar and creates environmental problems due to overplanting. \xe2\x80\x9cA triple-layer subsidy cake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Scott Faber of the E.W.G.'b'All this is the opposite of fiscal conservatism, but generally, politicians find a way to evolve on the subject when they get to Iowa. This year Cruz has hung tough. Perhaps it\xe2\x80\x99s because he\xe2\x80\x99s close to Big Oil, which wants the gas tanks for itself. But whatever the reason, he\xe2\x80\x99s paying the price. A pro-ethanol group, which happens to be led by the governor\xe2\x80\x99s son, ran a mess of ads against him. Cruz seemed to waver, then stiffened. Out charged Branstad with his warning. A popular governor\xe2\x80\x99s antipathy could be a big deal.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a minute to feel sympathy for Ted Cruz. Poor guy.'b'O.K., time\xe2\x80\x99s up.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDear Friend,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote Cruz to his mailing list on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x9cI literally have no time to explain. \xe2\x80\xa6 The longest-serving Republican career politician in the nation and his politically connected family is coordinating with establishment politicians and super PACs to lead an 11th-'b''b'hour attack against us and sink our campaign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ted said he is responding with \xe2\x80\x9ceverything I have.\xe2\x80\x9d But that would be much easier if he had another $265,000 in donations posthaste.'b'Meanwhile, Donald Trump is supremely happy. \xe2\x80\x9cThe governor just made a very big statement that was appreciated by many,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a gathering of \xe2\x80\x94 yes! \xe2\x80\x94 the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association before going on to announce that he was not only in favor of requiring corn in every tankful of gas, but he wanted to see the proportion go higher.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs president I will encourage Congress to be cautious in attempting to \xe2\x80\xa6 change 'b'any part 'b'of the R.F.S.,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. That would be renewable fuel standard. Trump was reading this speech, which he claimed he had written himself. It was deep into ethanol-speak. All of you who think he\xe2\x80\x99s still just a free spirit flying around the country saying whatever the hell comes into his mind, be aware. This is now an increasingly careful politician.'b'Cruz, he said, without actually mentioning any names, is a tool of the oil companies. \xe2\x80\x9cHe goes wherever the votes are,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said contemptuously.'b'None of that here, God knows.'b'As a political journalist, you never forget the first time you stop just covering a politician and start identifying with her. The first time you wed your high-minded vision of what politics should be to a real candidate\xe2\x80\x99s perishable breath.'b'My first time arrived in 2008. It lasted only a short while. Her name was Sarah Palin.'b'Let me explain. That spring, in between the Republican primary and the fall campaign, my friend Reihan Salam and I had published a book called \xe2\x80\x9cGrand New Party: How Republicans Can Win the Working Class and Save the American Dream.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the title suggests, we were calling for the G.O.P. to change, but not to moderate in the way that a lot of centrist pundits favored, returning to a Rockefeller-Republican model of fiscally prudent social liberalism. Rather, we thought the party\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity (and the country\xe2\x80\x99s) lay in a kind of socially conservative populism, which would link the family-values language of the religious right to an economic agenda more favorable to the working class than what the Republicans usually had offered.'b'Unfortunately this message conspicuously lacked a tribune in 2008. Mike Huckabee flirted with populism in the primary but never fleshed out an agenda, and the eventual nominee, John McCain, was an \xe2\x80\x9chonor and country\xe2\x80\x9d candidate who didn\xe2\x80\x99t care much about economic policy.'b'But in Alaska, there was a young, rising-star governor. She was pro-life, evangelical, a working mom. And her record way up north was 'b'reformist in a distinctly nonideological way'b': She was best known for fighting a corrupt nexus of politicians and the oil-and-gas industry, tackling crony capitalism on behalf of ordinary Alaskans.'b'And then, shockingly, McCain picked her as his running mate.'b'At which point the chattering classes went temporarily insane. Or maybe I went insane, who can say? But either way it seemed like everything I hated, a mix of sneering social liberalism, fecundophobia, anti-evangelical paranoia and class contempt, was being hurled at a candidate who seemed to fit exactly with the \xe2\x80\x9cGrand New Party\xe2\x80\x9d mold.'b'So I defended her. I assailed her critics. And then \xe2\x80\x94 well, you know what happened then.'b'Palin gave interviews \xe2\x80\x94 terrible, terrible interviews. She was in over her head. Her own paranoia took center stage. She became her critics\xe2\x80\x99 caricature, embracing a mix of willful ignorance and proud ressentiment. What was distinctive about her Alaskan career was subsumed into a much more conventional sort of movement conservatism, which she picked up from the professional ideologues who rallied to her during her trial by fire. And eventually the movement tired of her, the culture tired of her, and her act ceased to be interesting even as reality TV.'b'But now that she has re-emerged to endorse Donald Trump, uniting her brand with 'b'his \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again\xe2\x80\x9d nationalism'b', it\xe2\x80\x99s worth revisiting the original Palin, the outsider who took on a corrupt Alaskan establishment.'b'A lot of conservatives, especially in Ted Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, have acted shocked or disappointed that Palin would endorse a figure like Trump, who has no plausible claim to be a principled conservative.'b'But given Palin\xe2\x80\x99s Alaskan past, the endorsement makes perfect sense. Her real roots are not in Reaganism or libertarianism or the orthodoxies of the donor class. They\xe2\x80\x99re in the same kind of blue-collar, Jacksonian, \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x99s looking out for you?\xe2\x80\x9d populism that has carried Trump to the top of the Republican polls. And it\xe2\x80\x99s a populism that the G.O.P. is discovering has 'b'a lot more appeal'b' to many of its voters than the litmus tests of the official right.'b'Which means that in a certain way, Trump and Palin together on a stage is the closest American politics has come to offering the populist grand new party that Salam and I called for two presidential campaigns ago.'b'Except that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t what we called for, because we wanted a populism with substance \xe2\x80\x94 one that actually offered policy solutions to stagnant wages and rising health care costs, one that could help Republicans reach out to upwardly mobile blacks and Hispanics as well as whites, and so on down an optimistic wish list.'b'Whereas Trump-era populism, while it plays very effectively on economic anxiety, mostly offers braggadocio rather than solutions, and white identity politics rather than any kind of 'b'one-nation conservatism'b'.'b'I would like to tell you that this is all the fault of the Republican leadership \xe2\x80\x94 that had they been more receptive to populist ideas in 2008 or 2012, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be facing a Trumpian revolt today.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s roughly the argument that 'b'David Frum makes'b' in this month\xe2\x80\x99s Atlantic, in a sweeping essay on the roots of Trumpism. And he makes a strong case. A large part of the Republican donor class would rather lose with \xe2\x80\x9cyou didn\xe2\x80\x99t build that!\xe2\x80\x9d than compromise on upper-bracket tax cuts. It would rather try to win Hispanics with immigration reform a hundred times over than try to win them once on pocketbook issues. It prefers to campaign as though it\xe2\x80\x99s always 1980, and has little to say to people who have lost out from globalization and socioeconomic change.'b'A critique that stops with G.O.P. elites, though, might let the voting public off the hook. Because it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that Trumpism, in all its boastful, lord-of-misrule meretriciousness, is what many struggling Americans actually want.'b'That is, at a certain point disillusionment with the system becomes so strong that no wonkish policy proposal is likely to resonate anymore. So you can talk all you want (as Marco Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s water-treading campaign has tried to do) about improving vocational education or increasing the child-tax credit, and people will tune you out: They want someone who will arm-wrestle the Chinese, make Mexico pay for the wall, smite our enemies and generally stand in solidarity with their resentments, regardless of the policy results.'b'Since this is a recipe for American-style Putinism, it\xe2\x80\x99s not exactly a good sign for the republic that it seems to be resonating. But those of us who want a better, saner and more decent populism than what Donald Trump is selling need to reckon with the implications of his indubitable appeal.'b'Maybe \xe2\x80\x94 hopefully \xe2\x80\x94 there\xe2\x80\x99s a bridge from Trumpism to a more responsible alternative, as there was between Huey Long and F.D.R. or from 'b'George Wallace to Richard Nixon'b'.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that my fellow eggheads and I are grasping at a dream that\xe2\x80\x99s already slipped behind us \xe2\x80\x94 lost back in the land of might-have-beens, where the dark fields of Wasilla roll on under the night.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Justices to Hear State Challenge on Immigration'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 20):'b'This is how our constitutional republic works and has pretty much worked for more than two centuries: The three branches of government keep one another in check and balance.

Last year, the 51 'b'cases of wild poliovirus reported here'b' represented the bulk of all 70 cases reported throughout the world.'b'Even so, last year\xe2\x80\x99s count is cause for optimism, since it was a huge drop from the 294 cases reported in Pakistan in 2014, and because it seems to be a product of some clever adjustments the country has made to its longstanding polio eradication program, with help from the Pakistani Army and smartphone-based technology.'b'Since 1978, the country has had an official 'b'Expanded Program on Immunization'b', in which vaccinators go door to door to immunize against many childhood and other diseases \xe2\x80\x94 tuberculosis, hepatitis, meningitis, measles and more. But when the goal became finally stamping out the last traces of polio, the regimen had to be ramped up to include more than these periodic household visits.'b'As part of the World Health Organization\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013\xe2\x80\x932018'b', for example, the government announced that April 25 will be a National Switch Day for updating the kind of vaccine used, to account for the fact that Types 2 and 3 of the polio virus appear to have already been eliminated in Pakistan, with only Type 1 remaining. Recognizing that, the W.H.O. recommended a switch from a trivalent oral polio vaccine to a version that can target Type 1 more effectively.'b'The next milestone will be phasing out the oral vaccine, which is built from a weakened live virus, and replacing it with an inactive polio vaccine administered by injection. Starting in Punjab, that strategy will supplement the live-virus vaccine schedule with one dose of the inactive version, which eliminates even the small risk of contracting the disease from the live virus vaccine. One reason the inactive vaccine is coming into use only now is that it is five times more expensive than the live oral type. To overcome that obstacle, GAVI, a public-private organization funded by various countries, charities and international institutions, will help cover the cost. On Tuesday, GAVI and Unicef tweeted that the inactive vaccine is now available in all of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s provinces (#Pakistan h/t @UNICEF_Pakistan).'b'At the same time, Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s government has supplied vaccinators with motorcycles, for which Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Fund for International Development, along with Unicef, will provide fuel allowances. Lack of fuel has been a popular excuse for vaccinators who miss their vaccine targets because they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to travel to the far-flung areas where they are most needed. Security for vaccinators is an even bigger issue, illustrated by the bombing last Wednesday of a polio eradication center in Quetta that killed 14 policemen during an immunization drive.'b'Indeed, a 'b'long campaign of disinformation spread by the Taliban'b' helps explain why Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s polio eradication program has not yet wiped out the disease. In 2006, the extremist group declared vaccination to be a Western plot to sterilize Pashtun children and stunt their growth. It threatened to kill parents who had their children immunized, and violently attacked polio vaccinators in Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s tribal areas and in metropolitan Karachi. Celebrities joined campaigns to counter the propaganda, and religious leaders issued fatwas declaring that Islam permitted the immunization of children, but those efforts did nothing to stop the attacks.'b'In 2012, Taliban commanders and clerics affiliated with the movement also halted the immunization program in North Waziristan, in protest against American drone attacks that had followed the killing of Osama bin Laden by American Special Forces; subsequent revelations that the C.I.A. had used a bogus vaccination program to capture DNA material from Bin Laden\xe2\x80\x99s relatives gave the Taliban additional ammunition with which to besmirch all vaccinators as spies for America.'b'But much of that changed last January, after the Taliban disrupted a three-day immunization drive in Sindh Province by killing three polio workers. First, vaccinators refused to work until they were given more protection. Then, the Pakistani Army provided the vaccinators with visible security.'b'By that point, the army had already begun a nationwide anti-militant campaign in the wake of an attack on an army-run public school. When the offensive drove militants out of North Waziristan\xe2\x80\x99s tribal areas and Karachi\xe2\x80\x99s no-go zones, parents finally lowered their resistance to immunizing their children. What followed was the 70 percent drop in new polio cases over the full year.'b'Nevertheless, the Taliban\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to fight the campaign continue, as do management problems within the national immunization campaign. Some officials have been accused of siphoning money from its programs, or of using expired vaccines, and some vaccination plans have had difficulty targeting vulnerable populations.'b'One effort to resolve that problem was the introduction in Punjab last year of a smartphone app on which the region\xe2\x80\x99s 3,700 vaccinators could keep track of their work. Now, instead of going household to household, they go to a center where children have been assembled for vaccination. The vaccinators then send the data via phone to a central office. Using this approach, vaccinators\xe2\x80\x99 attendance rates, which at times had been as low as 21 percent, have risen to 95 percent to 100 percent.'b'Officials also have analyzed satellite images to target population clusters, and have produced a color-coded map showing where vaccinations have and haven\xe2\x80\x99t reached children in need.'b'By now, the rates of vaccination with the two types of antigens have risen beyond 70 percent, a critical threshold toward the goal of eradication.'b'Encouraged by those results, the Punjab government and the World Bank plan to invest in 10,000 more vaccinator smartphones, which will also capture a child\xe2\x80\x99s photo and the mother\xe2\x80\x99s cellphone number, enabling automatic reminders to a mother that a child is due for a vaccine scheduled near home.'b'The Punjab government is eager to share its technological know-how with the rest of the nation. One target area this year is remote Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.'b'And if Sindh and Baluchistan follow suit, there\xe2\x80\x99s every chance that Pakistan can catch up quickly to the rest of the world. A polio-free Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 and globe \xe2\x80\x94 may be coming sooner than you think.'b'KARACHI, Pakistan \xe2\x80\x94 According to our security analysts, the massacre of students and teachers at Bacha Khan University in Charsadda on Wednesday proves that we are winning against terrorism.'b'A month before that, 'b'Pakistan'b' marked the first anniversary of the Army Public School attacks in Peshawar, where more than 140 people, the vast majority of them students, were slaughtered by the 'b'Taliban'b'. Most were in their early teens. Never again, we said then. Parliament gave the military all the powers it wanted, and Pakistanis vowed to eliminate the killers of our children.'b'We marked the anniversary by honoring the dead and giving memorial shields to their parents. We put lots of flowers and candles around the young students\xe2\x80\x99 pictures. Newscasters on television dressed up in the school\xe2\x80\x99s uniform to express solidarity. The Pakistani Army\xe2\x80\x99s public relations department released a music video with students waving flags and raising fists. The singing students pledged not only to defeat the Taliban, but also to educate the enemy\xe2\x80\x99s children in revenge.'b'The army, however, did not answer the one question the parents of the dead students have been asking for more than a year: Who is responsible for the security of the children in a school managed by the army itself? Instead it released slickly edited music videos.'b'This year was declared the year that terror will end. Safe havens have been bombed into oblivion. Terrorists have been hanged and the rest are waiting for their turn, we are told. Hours after the attack in Charsadda, the Pakistani Army\xe2\x80\x99s spokesman told the nation that Operation Zarb-e-Azb, its sweeping antiterrorism campaign, has been a success and the \xe2\x80\x9cresults are there for everyone to see.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Security experts, a group likely to find a silver lining in hell, say that the Taliban are targeting schools because these are soft targets \xe2\x80\x93 and that this is proof the Taliban have been weakened and can no longer attack cantonments or airports. Apparently, we are supposed to take solace in the slaughter of our children because our cantonments and airports are safe.'b'The language used to report and commemorate these massacres is sickeningly celebratory and familiar. The students are called martyrs. Their courage is applauded. Their parents\xe2\x80\x99 bravery is praised. We are told these students laid down their lives for the sake of our future. But weren\xe2\x80\x99t they our future?'b'How much courage does it require to take a bullet in the head? What are their brave parents to do except cry and ask questions? Why do we forget that these students went to university to study math and chemistry, and not become martyrs? Why does a chemistry professor have to die trying to save his students? This is imposed martyrdom, and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t a sign of strength. It\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of utter helplessness.'b'The army is not alone in its speed to celebrate its own failures. The Pakistani media and other opinion makers are close behind. Although the Taliban jostle to take credit for these atrocities, analysts deflect the blame onto our older enemies. Someone from abroad must be funding the attackers, they say. Surely, India is behind this.'b'But weren\xe2\x80\x99t these killers our strategic assets until recently? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t they pledge to fight alongside the Pakistani Army if India dared attack us? Thousands of suspected terrorists have been killed in Operation Zarb-e-Azb and dozens have been hanged, and not a single foreigner has been identified among them.'b'But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t keep some of Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s most influential journalists from speculating, while the Wednesday attack was still underway, that India was involved, intent on avenging the attack on its airbase in Pathankot in early January. The same journalists were also screaming that India had staged the Pathankot attack in order to blame Pakistan. Do we really believe we have an enemy so cunning and so heartless that it kills its own soldiers so it can kill our children? And are we being told that our only option is to remain a martyr-producing factory?'b'The truth is that we do have a cunning and heartless enemy: Our brothers in faith and our fellow citizens. Some of them have automatic weapons and suicide vests; others have pens and TV shows, and rewrite history even as it happening.'b'Last week Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister and army chief were seen huddled together in a plane on their way to Saudi Arabia and then Iran. As the rulers of the sole Muslim nuclear power in the world, they were on a mission to bring peace to the region. Maybe they should lower their expectations at home.'b'Maybe they should try to ensure that when children go to school and university they don\xe2\x80\x99t become martyrs. The Pakistani political and military elites are fond of reminding everyone at every opportunity that the country\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear assets are safe. Could they one day make the same claim about our schoolchildren?'b'SIDELINED by homeland security, foreign policy and immigration, the economy is about to become a major topic in the race for the White House. Since the start of the year we have seen precipitous drops in the stock market and oil prices, combined with the threat that a slowing global economy may drag the United States down with it.'b'While political campaigns are rarely the best forum to achieve policy clarity, the spotlight this year\xe2\x80\x99s race will cast on economic issues will bring some needed debate about two pressing questions: Why is the United States still so economically insecure? And can we shore up that insecurity before the next downturn arrives?'b'The economy has repeatedly failed to achieve the liftoff that it is capable of. Despite the creation of six million jobs in the last two years, wage growth has been anemic, inequality has worsened and too many Americans lack the agility to adapt to structural changes, including those driven by technological innovations.'b'The success of the post-recession employment recovery and the uneven growth since then can be attributed to a single factor: After Congress\xe2\x80\x99s initial bailouts to stanch the bloodletting in 2008, the burden of economic policy making fell almost entirely on the Federal Reserve.'b'Having succeeded in helping the United States and the rest of the world avert a multiyear depression in 2008-9, the Fed pivoted to using unconventional monetary measures to pursue broader objectives. It did so through a combination of zero interest rates and large-scale purchases of securities to repress market volatility and increase asset prices, hoping to encourage consumption and investment.'b'This worked, to some extent. But it created a sizable wedge between artificially supported asset prices and rather sluggish fundamentals. And ultimately, these tools can buy time only until the political system delivers a broader policy response, which it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Now time is running out.'b'Thanks to mounting internal contradictions and operational stress, central banks are increasingly unwilling (like the Federal Reserve) or unable (like the People\xe2\x80\x99s Bank of China, the Bank of Japan and, soon, the European Central Bank) to borrow financial returns from the future. As a result, financial volatility is rising.'b'What follows is up to us. One road \xe2\x80\x94 where continued political dysfunction further sidelines a holistic policy response \xe2\x80\x94 could lead to recession. The other \xe2\x80\x94 a broadening policy response turbocharged by innovation and the productive deployment of corporate cash \xe2\x80\x94 could unleash high and inclusive growth.'b'Assuming that the presidential season clarifies these choices, the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s winner will face another challenge next year: how to deal with a Congress that has failed to handle even its most basic economic functions. Given the outlook for both a shaky global economy and higher financial volatility, the new administration will need to find a way to get Congress to implement measures in four specific areas, some of which already command bipartisan support.'b'The first covers long-overdue structural reforms. Guided by the administration, Congress needs to overhaul a tax system littered with anti-growth provisions, invest more in infrastructure, expand labor-market retraining and modernize our education system. The lack of such reforms, and the insecurity generated, is one main reason the private sector has held back from spending the enormous cash reserves on its balance sheets; encouraging that money to flow into productive activities, rather than share buybacks, would boost the economy.'b'America also needs a more responsive fiscal policy. This means, above all, redirecting resources that essentially subsidize the better-off segments of society, including the excessively low taxation of carried interest and other budgetary measures to help reduce the economic drag that inequality creates through reduced consumer demand.'b'Politicians must also act soon to avert the growing problem of student debt, a major obstacle for the incoming generation of workers. The government needs to increase the transparency of loan disclosures, enlarge steppingstone programs like community colleges, and make it easier for students to pay off their debt without sacrificing career opportunities.'b'Finally, the United States needs to push for critical reforms in the global finance infrastructure. It took embarrassingly long for the world to agree on modest changes in the governance of the International Monetary Fund, largely because Congress was disengaged. The next steps should include further reallocation of voting power from Europe to developing economies, consistent with today\xe2\x80\x99s global economic realities.'b'While I.M.F. reform might seem arcane, it could be vital to averting another global crisis \xe2\x80\x94 without changes, the fund\xe2\x80\x99s credibility will continue to be questioned, especially in the eyes of emerging economies, undermining global policy cooperation and increasing the risk of currency wars and other damaging coordination failures.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s little that is surprising about most of these items. What is surprising is that too few politicians, let alone presidential candidates, seem to grasp the need for them within the first year or so of the next administration. Even then, the risk of another recession will not be eliminated; that\xe2\x80\x99s the nature of business cycles. The point is to reduce the risk as much as possible, in the United States and abroad \xe2\x80\x94 and to lay the groundwork for high long-term and inclusive growth.'b'In 1936 George Orwell wrote a magnificent essay called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Shooting an Elephant'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Orwell had been working as a British police officer in Burma, enforcing colonial rule. An elephant had gone \xe2\x80\x9cmust,\xe2\x80\x9d broken its chains, trampled some homes and killed a man.'b'As Orwell walked, gun in hand, toward the elephant, a crowd of over 2,000 Burmese gathered behind him. They hated him, but it would be a diverting spectacle to see an elephant shot and they could use the meat. Orwell didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to shoot the poor creature, whose \xe2\x80\x9cmust,\xe2\x80\x9d or frenzied state, had passed and who was peacefully eating grass. But he felt the pressure of the crowd behind him. They\xe2\x80\x99d laugh at him if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill the thing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was only an absurd puppet pushed to and fro by the will of those yellow faces behind,\xe2\x80\x9d Orwell wrote. And so he subjected the animal to a long and agonizing death.'b'In his essay nobody feels like they have any power. The locals, the imperial victims, sure didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Orwell, the guy with the gun, didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel like he had any. The imperialists back in London were too far away.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s sort of the way much of the world is today. As Anand Giridharadas writes in The International New York Times, \xe2\x80\x9cIf anything unites America in this fractious moment it is a widespread sentiment that power is somewhere other than where you are.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Republican establishment thinks the grass roots have the power but the grass roots think the reverse. The unions think the corporations have the power but the corporations think the start-ups do. Regulators think Wall Street has the power but Wall Street thinks the regulators do. The 'b'Pew Research Center asked'b' Americans, \xe2\x80\x9cWould you say your side has been winning or losing more?\xe2\x80\x9d Sixty-four percent of Americans, with majorities of both parties, believe their side has been losing more.'b'These days people seem to underestimate their own power or suffer from what Giridharadas calls the \xe2\x80\x9canxiety of impotence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sometimes when groups feel oppressed, they organize by coming up with concrete reform proposals to empower themselves. The Black Lives Matter movement is doing this.'b'But in other cases the feeling of absolute powerlessness can corrupt absolutely. As psychological research has shown, many people who feel powerless come to feel unworthy, and become complicit in their own oppression. Some exaggerate the weight and size of the obstacles in front of them. Some feel dehumanized, forsaken, doomed and guilty.'b'Today we live in a world of isolation and atomization, where people distrust their own institutions. In such circumstances many people respond to powerlessness with pointless acts of self-destruction.'b'In the Palestinian territories, for example, young people don\xe2\x80\x99t organize or work with their government to improve their prospects. They wander into Israel, try to stab a soldier or a pregnant woman and get shot or arrested \xe2\x80\x94 every single time. They throw away their lives for a pointless and usually botched moment of terrorism.'b'In a different way, the American election has been perverted by feelings of powerlessness.'b'Americans are beset by complex, intractable problems that don\xe2\x80\x99t have a clear villain: technological change displaces workers; globalization and the rapid movement of people destabilize communities; family structure dissolves; the political order in the Middle East teeters, the Chinese economy craters, inequality rises, the global order frays, etc.'b'To address these problems we need big, responsible institutions (power centers) that can mobilize people, cobble together governing majorities and enact plans of actions. In the U.S. context that means functioning political parties and a functioning Congress.'b'Those institutions have been weakened of late. Parties have been rendered weak by both campaign finance laws and the Citizens United decision, which have cut off their funding streams and given power to polarized super-donors who work outside the party system. Congress has been weakened by polarization and disruptive members who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in legislating.'b'Instead of shoring up these institutions, many voters are inclined to make everything worse. Plagued by the anxiety of impotence many voters are drawn to leaders who pretend that our problems could be solved by defeating some villain. Donald Trump says stupid elites are the problem. Ted Cruz says it\xe2\x80\x99s the Washington cartel. Bernie Sanders says it\xe2\x80\x99s Wall Street.'b'The fact is, for all the problems we may have with Wall Street or Washington, our biggest problems are systemic \xe2\x80\x94 the disruptions caused by technological progress and globalization, mass migration, family breakdown and so on. There\xe2\x80\x99s no all-controlling Wizard of Oz to slay.'b'If we\xe2\x80\x99re to have any hope of addressing big systemic problems we\xe2\x80\x99ll have to repair big institutions and have functioning parties and a functioning Congress. We have to discard the anti-political, anti-institutional mood that is prevalent and rebuild effective democratic power centers.'b'This requires less atomization and more collective action, fewer strongmen but greater citizenship. It requires the craft of political architecture, not the demagogy of destruction.'b'There are still quite a few pundits determined to pretend that America\xe2\x80\x99s two great parties are symmetric \xe2\x80\x94 equally unwilling to face reality, equally pushed into extreme positions by special interests and rabid partisans. It\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, of course. Planned Parenthood isn\xe2\x80\x99t the same thing as the Koch brothers, nor is Bernie Sanders the moral equivalent of Ted Cruz. And there\xe2\x80\x99s no Democratic counterpart whatsoever to Donald Trump.'b'Moreover, when self-proclaimed centrist pundits get concrete about the policies they want, they have to tie themselves in knots to avoid admitting that what they\xe2\x80\x99re describing are basically the positions of a guy named Barack Obama.'b'Still, there are some currents in our political life that do run through both parties. And one of them is the persistent delusion that a hidden majority of American voters either supports or can be persuaded to support radical policies, if only the right person were to make the case with sufficient fervor.'b'You see this on the right among hard-line conservatives, who insist that only the cowardice of Republican leaders has prevented the rollback of every progressive program instituted in the past couple of generations. Actually, you also see a version of this tendency among genteel, country-club-type Republicans, who continue to imagine that they represent the party\xe2\x80\x99s mainstream even as 'b'polls show'b' that almost two-thirds of likely primary voters support Mr. Trump, Mr. Cruz or Ben Carson.'b'Meanwhile, on the left there is always a contingent of idealistic voters eager to believe that a sufficiently high-minded leader can conjure up the better angels of America\xe2\x80\x99s nature and persuade the broad public to support a radical overhaul of our institutions. In 2008 that contingent rallied behind Mr. Obama; now they\xe2\x80\x99re backing Mr. Sanders, who has adopted such a purist stance that the other day he 'b'dismissed Planned Parenthood'b' (which has endorsed Hillary Clinton) as part of the \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But as Mr. Obama himself found out as soon as he took office, transformational rhetoric isn\xe2\x80\x99t how change happens. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that he\xe2\x80\x99s a failure. On the contrary, he\xe2\x80\x99s been an extremely consequential president, doing more to advance the progressive agenda than anyone since L.B.J.'b'Yet his achievements have depended at every stage on accepting half loaves as being better than none: health reform that leaves the system largely private, financial reform that seriously restricts Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s abuses without fully breaking its power, higher taxes on the rich but no full-scale assault on inequality.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of mini-dispute among Democrats over who can claim to be Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s true heir \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Sanders or Mrs. Clinton? But the answer is obvious: Mr. Sanders is the heir to candidate Obama, but Mrs. Clinton is the heir to President Obama. (In fact, the health reform we got was basically her proposal, not his.)'b'Could Mr. Obama have been more transformational? Maybe he could have done more at the margins. But the truth is that he was elected under the most favorable circumstances possible, a financial crisis that utterly discredited his predecessor \xe2\x80\x94 and still faced scorched-earth opposition from Day 1.'b'And the question Sanders supporters should ask is, When has their theory of change ever worked? Even F.D.R., who rode the depths of the Great Depression to a huge majority, had to be politically pragmatic, working not just with special interest groups but also with Southern racists.'b'Remember, too, that the institutions F.D.R. created were add-ons, not replacements: Social Security didn\xe2\x80\x99t replace private pensions, unlike the Sanders proposal to replace private health insurance with single-payer. Oh, and Social Security originally covered only 'b'half the work force'b', and as a result largely excluded African-Americans.'b'Just to be clear: I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that someone like Mr. Sanders is unelectable, although Republican operatives would 'b'evidently rather face him'b' than Mrs. Clinton \xe2\x80\x94 they know that his current polling is meaningless, because he has never yet faced their attack machine. But even if he was to become president, he would end up facing the same harsh realities that constrained Mr. Obama.'b'The point is that while idealism is fine and essential \xe2\x80\x94 you have to dream of a better world \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s not a virtue unless it goes along with hardheaded realism about the means that might achieve your ends. That\xe2\x80\x99s true even when, like F.D.R., you ride a political tidal wave into office. It\xe2\x80\x99s even more true for a modern Democrat, who will be lucky if his or her party controls even one house of Congress at any point this decade.'b'Sorry, but there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing noble about seeing your values defeated because you preferred happy dreams to hard thinking about means and ends. Don\xe2\x80\x99t let idealism veer into destructive self-indulgence.'b'This weekend, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to the Mojave Desert, deep into an arid wilderness of a half-million acres, for some stargazing, bouldering and January sunshine on my public lands. I won\xe2\x80\x99t be out of contact. I checked. If Sarah Palin says something stupid on Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s behalf \xe2\x80\x94 scratch that. 'b'When'b' Sarah Palin says something stupid on Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s behalf, I\xe2\x80\x99ll get her speaking-in-tongues buffoonery in real time, along with the rest of the nation.'b'The old me would have despised the new me for admitting such a thing. I\xe2\x80\x99ve tried to go on digital diets, fasting from my screens. I was a friend\xe2\x80\x99s guest at a spa in Arizona once and had so much trouble being \xe2\x80\x9cmindful\xe2\x80\x9d that they nearly kicked me out. Actually, I just wanted to make sure I didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss the Seahawks game, mindful of Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s woeful offensive line.'b'In the information blur of last year, you may have overlooked news of our incredibly shrinking attention span. A survey of Canadian media consumption by Microsoft concluded that the average attention span had fallen to eight seconds, down from 12 in the year 2000. We now have a shorter attention span than goldfish, the study found.'b'Attention span was defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of concentrated time on a task without becoming distracted.\xe2\x80\x9d I tried to read the entire 54-page report, but well, you know. Still, a quote from Satya Nadella, the chief executive officer of Microsoft, jumped out at me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe true scarce commodity\xe2\x80\x9d of the near future, he said, will be \xe2\x80\x9chuman attention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Putting aside Microsoft\xe2\x80\x99s self-interest in promoting quick-flash digital ads with what may be junk science, there seems little doubt that our devices have rewired our brains. We think in McNugget time. The trash flows, unfiltered, along with the relevant stuff, in an eternal stream. And the last hit of dopamine only accelerates the need for another one.'b'I can no longer wait in a grocery store line, or linger for a traffic light, or even pause long enough to let a bagel pop from the toaster, without reflexively reaching for my smartphone. One of the joys of going to Europe was always the distance \xe2\x80\x94 nine hours in my case \xe2\x80\x94 from compulsive contemporaneous chatter. While I hiked the Cinque Terre, the West Coast was sleeping. No more. Somebody, somewhere is alerting me to something that can\xe2\x80\x99t wait.'b'You see it in the press, the obsession with mindless listicles that have all the staying power of a Popsicle. You see it in our politics, with fear-mongering slogans replacing anything that requires sustained thought. And the collapse of a fact-based democracy, where, for example, 60 percent of Trump supporters believe Obama was born in another country, has to be a byproduct of the pick-and-choose news from the buffet line of our screens.'b'Even \xe2\x80\x9cDownton Abbey,\xe2\x80\x9d supposedly an exemplar of popular taste for refined drama in the Digital Age, is in fact a very hyper-paced entertainment. The camera seldom holds a scene for long, cutting from Mrs. Patmore\xe2\x80\x99s sexual advice to the butler Barrow\xe2\x80\x99s latest plotting at a speed that is more Nascar than \xe2\x80\x9cMasterpiece Theatre.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A New York friend used to send me clever, well-thought-out emails, gems of sprightly prose. Then he switched to texting, which abbreviated his wit and style. Now all verbs and nouns have vanished; he sends emojis, the worst thing to happen to communication in our time.'b'But all is not lost. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the neuroscience has to say about this, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve found a pair of antidotes, very old school, for my shrinking attention span.'b'The first is gardening. You plant something in the cold, wet soil of the fall \xe2\x80\x94 tulip bulbs or garlic \xe2\x80\x94 and then you want to shout, \xe2\x80\x9cGrow!\xe2\x80\x9d Eight seconds later, nothing. Working the ground, there\xe2\x80\x99s no instant gratification. The planting itself forces you to think in half-year-increments, or longer for trees and perennials. The mind drifts, from the chill of a dark day to a springtime of color. Hope, goes the Emily Dickinson poem, is the thing with feathers. But it\xe2\x80\x99s also the thing that rises from a tiny seed, in its own sweet time.'b'The second is deep reading, especially in the hibernation months of winter. I\xe2\x80\x99m nearly done with the second volume of William Manchester\xe2\x80\x99s masterly biography of Winston Churchill, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Last Lion.\xe2\x80\x9d (O.K., I\xe2\x80\x99m late to the book, Churchillians.) It\xe2\x80\x99s zipping by. Next up is a new history of the Roman Empire.'b'Remember all those predictions that technology was going to kill book reading? It never happened. Paper books and stores that sell them are experiencing a revival of sorts. So, yes, I\xe2\x80\x99m as screen-scrolly as the next guy when I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the world in the palm of my hand. But put the thing aside, and kneel next to fresh-tilled earth, or curl up with an 800-page tome, and you find that the desire for sustained concentration is not lost. If anything, it\xe2\x80\x99s greater.'b'Irony alert: I invite you to follow me on Twitter, 'b'@nytegan'b'.'b'The 274 pages of emails released under pressure on Wednesday by Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan show a cynical and callous indifference to the plight of the mostly black, poverty-stricken residents of Flint, who have gone for more than a year with poisoned tap water that is unsafe to drink or bathe in. There is little doubt that an affluent, predominantly white community \xe2\x80\x94 say Grosse Pointe or Bloomfield Hills \xe2\x80\x94 would never face such a public health catastrophe, and if it had, the state government would have rushed in to help.'b'At every juncture when state officials could have avoided or reduced the harm in Flint, they ignored public pleas and made every effort to dismiss the truth.'b'The 'b'newly released emails'b' show that members of Mr. Snyder\xe2\x80\x99s administration consistently mocked and belittled the complaints of Flint residents and the evidence gathered by independent researchers. Outrage is the only sensible response to this man-made disaster, in which inexcusable decisions, by the state and emergency managers appointed by Mr. Snyder to oversee the city\xe2\x80\x99s finances, led to corrosion of the water pipes and high levels of lead in the water and the blood of city residents. Thousands of children were exposed to water with lead, which could cause long-term health and developmental problems.'b'As President Obama said during a visit to Detroit on Wednesday, \xe2\x80\x9cI know that if I was a parent up there, I would be beside myself that my kid\xe2\x80\x99s health could be at risk.\xe2\x80\x9d He called the fiasco \xe2\x80\x9ca reminder of why you can\xe2\x80\x99t shortchange basic services that we provide to our people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The emails are only those sent to or from the governor, not those sent between members of his administration. That is unacceptable. He needs to release every email that might shed light on how this calamity developed, and who was responsible. Even Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s limited release shows an appalling lack of urgency in responding to Flint\xe2\x80\x99s water problems and a determination to blame the city for the crisis.'b'For example, various emails showed that state officials dismissed one group of critics as being an \xe2\x80\x9canti-everything group\xe2\x80\x9d and accused others of trying to turn the issue of children\xe2\x80\x99s exposure to lead into a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical football.\xe2\x80\x9d Virtually everyone in the city knew that there were problems with the Flint River water, which smelled bad, was an odd color, caused skin rashes in some people and led to several advisories from the state to boil the water before drinking it.'b'Flint\xe2\x80\x99s City Council voted 7 to 1 in March 2015 to \xe2\x80\x9cdo all things necessary\xe2\x80\x9d to return to purchasing clean water from Detroit, only to have the emergency manager at the time veto the measure as \xe2\x80\x9cincomprehensible\xe2\x80\x9d because he considered the water safe and believed it was more important to save money than to respond to the pleas of Flint residents.'b'Although state officials insisted that their data showed no serious lead problems in Flint, the released emails suggest otherwise. They reveal that the state\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Environmental Quality ignored warnings from an expert from the federal Environmental Protection Agency, who said in early 2015 that the state was testing the water in a way that could profoundly understate the lead levels.'b'Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and demonstrators in Michigan have called for Mr. Snyder to resign. Several state officials have already resigned, including the director of the state Department of Environmental Quality and his chief spokesman, and the governor\xe2\x80\x99s chief of staff and chief spokeswoman.'b'State and federal investigations are underway to dig more deeply into how this disaster happened and those responsible for it. Once more is known, other resignations are likely to be in order.'b'On the night of Oct. 29, 2012, Linda Vergara looked out the front door of her home in Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, and thought: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not good. We better get out of here.\xe2\x80\x9d Hurricane Sandy had arrived a few hours earlier, and Ms. Vergara, like thousands of New Yorkers, assumed she was in a safe zone and would not need to evacuate. Then the surge came. By the time she got her coat on and headed out to the street, the water was up to her waist. She saw cars and other debris floating around and joined some of her neighbors as they struggled to reach higher ground.'b'More than three years later, Ms. Vergara, 60, is still waiting to get back into the home and the neighborhood that she loves. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s such a wonderful community,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no place like it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York City\xe2\x80\x99s recovery program, 'b'Build It Back'b', has been a bureaucratic and paperwork-filled nightmare for Ms. Vergara. She has moved in and out of temporary housing over the years, each time hoping construction would begin. Unfortunately, something would always come up. At one point, she was able to fix her house up enough to move back, but then she had to deal with issues like mold and water getting into the electrical box. The longer it has taken to rebuild, the more her house, and her health, has deteriorated.'b'Last August, Ms. Vergara was told that reconstruction would start soon, but that she would need to relocate once again until it was completed.

But a yearlong official inquiry has now shockingly concluded that Mr. Putin very likely played a decisive role. The accusation immediately unsettled relations between London and Moscow and sparked outraged denials in the Kremlin.'b'The inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s 328-page 'b'report'b' did not provide direct evidence of Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s culpability, but cited \xe2\x80\x9cstrong circumstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of Kremlin responsibility in the death of Mr. Litvinenko, who fled Russia and became a citizen of Britain, where he was a relentless critic of the Kremlin and particularly Mr. Putin.'b''b'Mr. Litvinenko died'b' 22 days after drinking green tea from a pot laced with polonium 210 \xe2\x80\x94 a rare substance not known to be available beyond a government nuclear reactor \xe2\x80\x94 in the company of the two Russian agents whom he met at the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel in London. The Kremlin has rejected British requests that the two be extradited as suspects in the killing.'b'The chief of the inquiry, Robert Owen, a retired High Court judge, noted that secret intelligence testimony gathered in private sessions factored in his conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cmembers of the Putin administration, including the president himself\xe2\x80\x9d and Nikolai Patrushev, the chief of the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s spy service, had \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful motives\xe2\x80\x9d for taking action against Mr. Litvinenko, including killing him. Further, Judge Owen found there was \xe2\x80\x9cundoubtedly a personal dimension\xe2\x80\x9d to the antagonism between Mr. Putin and Mr. Litvinenko, whose repeated denunciations of the Russian leader included accusations of pedophilia.'b'The inquiry leaves little room to doubt that the two agents were sent from Russia to visit Mr. Litvinenko and were carrying the fatal dose of polonium with them. Would they dare to carry out such an act without approval from the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s upper reaches? \xe2\x80\x9cI am sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Owen concluded, that the two agents \xe2\x80\x9cwere acting on behalf of others when they poisoned Mr. Litvinenko.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A big question is what effect the inquiry will have on international relations. The British home secretary, Theresa May, called the Litvinenko murder \xe2\x80\x9ca blatant and unacceptable breach\xe2\x80\x9d of international law and civilized behavior that would be raised with Mr. Putin at the next opportunity.'b'Russian diplomats said the accusations could only harm relations with Britain. But Prime Minister David Cameron said his nation had no choice except to go on having \xe2\x80\x9csome sort of relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with Russia because of the crisis in Syria, whose leader, Bashar al-Assad, has long been supported by Moscow. Still, the relationship would now be pursued with \xe2\x80\x9cclear eyes and a very cold heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'told BBC News'b'. Others like Crispin Blunt, Tory chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe are dealing with unsavory partners all over the world. That is part of the necessity of diplomacy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Putin has built a sordid record on justice and human rights, which naturally reinforces suspicions that he could easily have been involved in the murder. At the very least, the London inquiry, however much it is denied at the Kremlin, should serve as a caution to the Russian leader to repair his reputation for notorious intrigues abroad.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Health Reform Realities'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (column, Jan. 18):'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m glad to see that Paul Krugman acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cif we could start from scratch, many, perhaps most, health economists would recommend single-payer, a Medicare-type program covering everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d His argument that we should not work for it now is unconvincing.'b'Just because private insurers are powerful doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean a concerted national campaign can\xe2\x80\x99t overcome their well-funded opposition.

The people of his constituency had consistently voted for the local Shan party in the past.'b'Yet he lost to a candidate from the National League for Democracy (N.L.D.), the majority-Bamar party led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, which swept the general election last year, winning some 80 percent of contested seats in the national Parliament. Apparently, it was the ethnic Wa people of Shan State, many of whom resettled there from northern parts of country in the late 1990s, who cast the decisive votes.'b'Rumor has it they had received instructions to vote for the N.L.D. from the United Wa State Army \xe2\x80\x94 at 30,000-strong, the most powerful rebel group in the country \xe2\x80\x94 which is headquartered on Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s border with China. Chinese sources I spoke to in academe and the intelligence services denied that Beijing had anything to do with those directives. But one senior Shan politician and three Myanmar military insiders said they thought it was Chinese influence that had swung the Wa votes in Shan State.'b'Why would Beijing, which has long backed Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s military regime and refused to engage with pro-democracy parties, now support the N.L.D.? One reason is that in recent years it saw the political tide turning in Myanmar. Another is that it has come to think of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi as a consummate pragmatist, and at a time when the Myanmar army, known as the Tatmadaw, was making political and military overtures to the United States and its allies.'b'But Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s rapprochement with the N.L.D. now threatens the legitimacy of Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s generals on issues they have long considered to be within their exclusive purview: foreign policy, border affairs, national security, federalism. So while improved relations between China and the incoming N.L.D. government could help quiet unrest in border areas, they could also upset the uneasy balance of power among Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s elites in Naypyidaw.'b'China\xe2\x80\x99s relations with Myanmar have ebbed under President Thein Sein, down to lows not seen since the Cultural Revolution in the late 1960s, when anti-Chinese riots broke out and Beijing began backing Communist rebels in Myanmar. Ties had then slowly improved because both Deng Xiaoping and the military-led socialist government in Myanmar maintained a neutral foreign policy.'b'After a military junta took power in 1988, relations graduated to the level of strategic partnership. That the West promptly marginalized the junta and slapped it with sanctions helped matters along, and for the next two decades political, economic and military cooperation between China and Myanmar deepened. Myanmar offered China natural resources and strategic access to the Bay of Bengal, among other things. Beijing provided Myanmar with aid, arms and military training, as well as diplomatic cover.'b'Relations soured again when the Myanmar government started to liberalize in 2010. In 2011, the now-nominally democratic government in Naypyidaw suspended construction on the massive Chinese-funded Myitsone hydropower dam project. This was largely in response to local opposition to environmental damage and abusive Chinese business practices. But Beijing saw the move as another sign that the Myanmar government was trying to move away from its zone of influence. It reviewed its Myanmar policy.'b'In recent years, the Chinese government has courted opposition groups and critics of the Myanmar government \xe2\x80\x94 hosting, sometimes even feting, journalists, civil society leaders and representatives from ethnic groups and political parties, including Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and other senior N.L.D. officials.'b'Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, for her part, has adopted positions that are generally accommodating to China\xe2\x80\x99s interests, including some that seem to cut against the N.L.D.\xe2\x80\x99s stated policies, such as the importance of public buy-in in major foreign projects.'b'To the dismay of some N.L.D. voters, she has said little to challenge the Myitsone project, and has come out in support of a controversial Chinese copper mine, even after the police cracked down on protesters opposing it. She has praised China\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cOne Belt, One Road\xe2\x80\x9d initiative, a centerpiece of the foreign policy and development strategy of President Xi Jinping. Although she once pleaded with the international community, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease use your liberty to promote ours,\xe2\x80\x9d she has been noticeably quiet about human rights issues in China, including the imprisonment of Liu Xiaobo, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize Laureate.'b'The Chinese government, meanwhile, seems to have been stirring low-level trouble along the border in order to gain leverage and push its interests, both strategic and economic, in Myanmar. Lately, it has increased its patronage of local ethnic armed groups, especially the United Wa State Army and the Kokang army. Senior Myanmar officials allege that the Kokang insurgency, also in the north, flared up again in 2015 thanks to armament, logistical support and troops provided by China.'b'The Tatmadaw is now in an awkward position: Any improvement of relations between Beijing and Naypyidaw under an N.L.D. government would be a double-edged sword. Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s generals would surely welcome some respite from ethnic strife in the north, but they hardly want to be seen as outsourcing security issues to an elected civilian government.'b'Which may explain why the Tatmadaw has recently taken to describing its fight against ethnic rebel groups as an effort to defend the country\xe2\x80\x99s integrity and sovereignty, rather than as a simple counterinsurgency campaign. By casting local civil conflicts in broader geopolitical terms, it hopes to establish that it is indispensable.'b'Several political and military officials in Myanmar and intelligence officers in Yunnan have told me they expect Beijing and the N.L.D. to strike some kind of arrangement after the N.L.D. forms a new government in a few months. China would press ethnic rebel groups to cooperate with the N.L.D. on a national cease-fire accord, handing Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi a victory that has eluded the current government. In exchange, the N.L.D. would yield to important Chinese interests in Myanmar, such as major infrastructure and investment projects.'b'This leaves the Tatmadaw with few cards to play. It cannot try to undermine Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi\xe2\x80\x99s legitimacy or win support from the West by stoking anti-Chinese sentiment \xe2\x80\x94 at least not without also running the risk of triggering an aggressive response from China in the northeast. (Or else it would have to go all out, and invoke the clauses in the 2008 Constitution that entitle the military to take power in the case of a national emergency.)'b'However much the prospect of greater cooperation between the new N.L.D. government and China irks them, Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s generals may nonetheless be willing to accept it \xe2\x80\x94 so long as civilian authorities consult them first. So far Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi has seemed willing to work with the Tatmadaw; she would do well to continue if she hopes for further rapprochement with the Chinese. Peace between Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s Lady and its generals runs through Beijing.'b'The world has responded with billions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the multiplying emergencies around the world, but the need has far outstripped that generosity. The fact is, as the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, puts it, we are living in \xe2\x80\x9cthe age of the megacrises.\xe2\x80\x9d Wars and natural disasters have pushed 125 million people worldwide from their homes and severed them from their traditional livelihoods.'b'To provide these people with the barest means of survival requires $40 billion a year. Though humanitarian funding reached $24.5 billion in 2014, more than 12 times the $2 billion raised in 2000, that still left a shortfall of nearly $15 billion. The current system, based on responding to catastrophes as they happen and on the outdated notion that each crisis will be limited in scope and in time, clearly isn\xe2\x80\x99t working.'b'On Sunday, the United Nations released a report detailing ambitious plans to overhaul global humanitarian financing. The report recommends a multipronged approach: more concerted effort to end conflicts and prepare for natural disasters, increasing funds by imposing small taxes of a few cents on the sale of high-volume goods and services, tapping into Islamic finance mechanisms in the Muslim world and enlisting the expertise of global businesses. The report\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations will be discussed at the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, to be held in Istanbul in May.'b'The members of the panel that worked on the report failed to reach consensus on some of the particulars, including microtaxes on transactions. But there is precedent for that strategy: A small tax on airfare raised $2 billion between 2006 and 2011, largely for immunization programs worldwide. The panel has reached out to FIFA, the soccer governing body, for a humanitarian tax added to ticket purchases. Another possibility is placing small, voluntary fees on taxi rides, through Uber and other taxi apps.'b'At the summit in Istanbul, governments and organizations should strive for consensus around the main proposals of the United Nations report. As the refugee crisis in Europe drives home, the fallout from a calamity in one region can trigger crises in others. Fixing financing for humanitarian aid is urgent in the interest of global stability.'b'JERUSALEM \xe2\x80\x94 Dizengoff Street in Tel Aviv is always bustling. Youngsters, families and tourists fill its shops, cafes and bars. On Jan. 1, this boulevard became the site of another terrorist attack on Israelis. First, two young men were gunned down in a bar; then, as he fled the scene, the terrorist killed a taxi driver. Several others were injured.'b'A week later, after a long pursuit, the terrorist, an Israeli-Arab citizen named Nashat Melhem, was encircled by security forces in his hide-out in the town of Arara, and was 'b'shot dead'b' after he had opened fire at his pursuers. Nashat Melhem\xe2\x80\x99s rampage in Tel Aviv was not his first attempt at terror, as he had a 2007 'b'conviction'b' for assaulting a soldier and trying to seize his gun.'b'A vast majority of Arara\xe2\x80\x99s residents are law-abiding Israeli citizens, men and women who go about their daily lives peacefully and have nothing to do with terrorism. But not far from Arara, and less than an hour\xe2\x80\x99s drive from Tel Aviv, is the headquarters of the northern branch of the Islamic Movement in 'b'Israel'b', which is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.'b'In line with other radical Islamists throughout the region, the northern branch of the Islamic Movement\xe2\x80\x99s followers preach an extremist message, seeking to sow discord among Jews, Christians and Muslims. Over the years, the organization, under cover of freedom of speech, began to abuse its democratic privileges by inciting violence. That was why I was among those in the government who led the move to 'b'ban'b' it.'b'Attacks like the one in Tel Aviv threaten the already complex and delicate relationship between Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Jewish population and its Arab minority, a group that accounts for 1.7 million of our more than eight million citizens. At such moments of heightened tension, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s government has clear responsibilities.'b'First, we must protect our people. Over more than three decades as a combat soldier, I learned that we have no choice but to fight terrorism and cut its branches without hesitation or compromise.'b'At the same time, we must preserve the rights and freedoms of an open democracy, and maintain the atmosphere of respect and tolerance necessary for a diverse and pluralistic society. This involves the recognition that the fates of our land\xe2\x80\x99s Jewish inhabitants and its Arab ones are deeply intertwined.'b'The Israeli government and the Arab Israeli leadership share a common responsibility to curb incitement in Israel. That is why I recently invited Ayman Odeh, a member of the Knesset and the leader of the Joint List alliance of Arab parties, to join me in visiting a number of Arab Israeli towns. Together, we examined firsthand the challenges facing Arab Israeli communities so that we could bring about solutions.'b'That effort has already started. Just two days before the Tel Aviv attack, the Israeli cabinet 'b'agreed to allocate'b' an additional $3.8 billion for housing, social welfare, infrastructure, transportation and education in Arab Israeli areas. Particularly in the context of the hard days we\xe2\x80\x99ve just endured, this extra grant represents an important step in the right direction.'b'At this critical moment, we have to carry out a strategic plan to fight crime and poverty among Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Arab population and build the community\xe2\x80\x99s social and economic institutions. More than ever, this is at the heart of our national interest, and it has to be a top priority for our government.'b'Housing and construction, which fall under my responsibility as a cabinet minister, are vitally important to improving the socioeconomic status of the Arabs. We are now working to expand the municipal boundaries of Arab towns and cities, frozen for decades, by putting sections of publicly owned land under their jurisdiction.'b'The Israeli government will build new Arab neighborhoods on this land, with high-quality housing, while leveraging an existing public program to help young Arab couples purchase homes for the first time. As part of this effort, we are planning to build a new state-of-the-art Arab city in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s north; named Jadeidi-Makr, it will be home to 45,000 people.'b'Jews and Arabs have lived together in our land for many centuries, and will continue to do so for generations to come. It is our duty to accept this reality by nurturing a culture and a country where both peoples can thrive.'b'We should not forget that, more than a decade before the state of Israel was established, 'b'Zeev Jabotinsky'b', the founder of Revisionist Zionism and the ideological forefather of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right-wing Likud Party, recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe political, economic, and cultural welfare of the Arabs will always remain a primary condition of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s well-being.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Our Declaration of Independence guarantees full equality for all our citizens. Throughout the years, we have been able to preserve a fine balance between security and liberalism, and we must maintain it. This is what makes Israel unique in our region, and it will always remain a great source of pride for us.'b'When terrorism strikes, we must prevent the outbreak of anti-Arab sentiment in the broader society; it only adds to the Israeli-Arab community\xe2\x80\x99s alienation, and that risks giving legitimacy to the extremists. Israeli Arabs are our citizens; they are not the enemy \xe2\x80\x94 and we must not allow anybody to undermine Israel\xe2\x80\x99s character as a Jewish and democratic state.'b'Extremism and terrorism will not overpower the government\xe2\x80\x99s resolve, which is to ensure the safety of the Israeli public and provide a prosperous future for our Jewish and Arab citizens.'b'Americans of all races, creeds and political persuasions are united today in the realization that, good grief, Donald Trump actually 'b'could'b' become the Republican presidential nominee.'b'It hits different people different ways.

He\xe2\x80\x99s been basking in the way Republican honchos are \xe2\x80\x9cwarming up\xe2\x80\x9d to him.'b'Under normal conditions, if a party was confronted with a candidate who had never held any public office, whose political activism consisted mainly of trying to prove Barack Obama was born in Africa, and whose platform consisted of whatever stuff was getting good crowd response at the last rally, everybody would race to get behind the alternative.'b'So if Trump does win this thing, he\xe2\x80\x99ll owe it all to the terribleness of Ted Cruz.'b'Cruz is the No. 2 every politician dreams of being stacked up against in a contest where the road is long and, sooner or later, everybody needs a friend. It\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating how much his fellow Republicans hate this guy.'b'This week, even as National Review launched a roundup of conservatives saying, in effect, 'b'Donald Trump, oh God, no,'b' party leaders were sending out signals that he was someone they could live with if the other choice was Cruz.'b'Policywise, Cruz isn\xe2\x80\x99t much different from every other Republican running around Iowa and New Hampshire. So it\xe2\x80\x99s just him'b'. 'b'Even in a world full of egotists, the senator from Texas is regarded as off the charts.'b'When John McCain was running for president and ran into controversy about being born outside the United States, his colleagues passed a bipartisan resolution stating that, in their opinion, he met all the constitutional requirements. When the Canada thing came up with Cruz, there was dead silence. You could sort of imagine the entire Senate sitting, twiddling their thumbs and smirking.'b'Besides his talent for not being Ted Cruz, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s other strong suit for Republican leaders is the suspicion that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly believe anything he says. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that he 'b'disbelieves 'b'it. His positions are more like thoughts of the moment, or opening bids. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s got the right personality, and he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of a deal-maker,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob Dole told The Times\xe2\x80\x99s Jonathan Martin.'b'In one way, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign pitch is a little like Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s. She\xe2\x80\x99s less about a new vision than about the ability to take care of the government, wring some long-awaited changes out of Congress and handle foreign affairs. His is about getting things done through the miracle of genius negotiating. (\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to get things done folks, O.K.? Believe me, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to make such great deals.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Really, they\xe2\x80\x99re very similar in that sense. Except that she\xe2\x80\x99s been a senator and secretary of state, and he\xe2\x80\x99s got his name on a ton of golf courses.'b'We live in strange times, people. Strange times.'b'To watch \xe2\x80\x9cThe X-Files\xe2\x80\x9d in 2016 is a strange thing. The original television show was so much a child of the peaceful \xe2\x80\x9990s that it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to forget it actually limped along until 2002. Its best seasons aired after the Gulf War and before 9/11, and took place in a version of the United States where the government apparently had so few terrestrial problems to deal with that its highest priority was keeping its citizens in the dark about aliens.'b'That America was never real, of course, but it feels especially far-off now. The post-\xe2\x80\x9cX-Files\xe2\x80\x9d era has brought with it not just the invasion of Iraq and the war on terror, but the rise of \xe2\x80\x9ctruthers\xe2\x80\x9d and the politically inflected paranoia they spread. Conspiracy theorists now traffic in the idea that 9/11 was an inside job and that gun massacres like Sandy Hook are \xe2\x80\x9cfalse flags\xe2\x80\x9d cooked up so the government can confiscate guns.'b'The rebooted \xe2\x80\x9cX-Files,\xe2\x80\x9d which premieres on Sunday, probably couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have ignored this development, and so \xe2\x80\x94 spoiler alert \xe2\x80\x94 it opts to embrace it, throwing the protagonists, Mulder and Scully, together with a conservative 9/11 truther named Tad O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, who\xe2\x80\x99s investigating a plot so vast that it includes nuclear bombs, alien-human hybridization and a takeover of the entire world using weather manipulation, junk food, the Patriot Act, military and police actions and, somewhat oddly, the Federal Emergency Management Agency.'b'Early reviews have not been especially kind to the reboot\xe2\x80\x99s first episode, and it\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps best viewed less as a new entry into the \xe2\x80\x9cX-Files\xe2\x80\x9d canon than as a reminder of what was great about the original.'b'Mulder and Scully did uncover some complex government plots in the original series, though many episodes ended not with dramatic revelations but with no resolution at all. \xe2\x80\x9cD.P.O.,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, centers on an auto mechanic with the ability to channel lightning. After he gives a man a heart attack, saves him and zaps multiple others, he is hospitalized and examined. Scully relays the results: \xe2\x80\x9cNothing unusual was detected.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The show was at its best when its heroes investigated something very creepy \xe2\x80\x94 a ship on the Norwegian Sea whose crew mysteriously ages, for instance \xe2\x80\x94 and came up with more questions than answers. The real pleasure of \xe2\x80\x9cThe X-Files\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t having your worst fears about the government confirmed; it was realizing that our world might still contain phenomena that are unexplained, and perhaps unexplainable.'b'We get flashes of this old spirit in the second and third episodes of the reboot. I hope the rest of the six-episode series continues in this vein, because watching TV heroes embrace conspiracy theories isn\xe2\x80\x99t much fun when presidential candidates foster gun-confiscation paranoia and a 9/11 truther 'b'is campaigning for Donald Trump in Iowa'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll we can do, Scully, is pull the thread, see what it unravels,\xe2\x80\x9d Mulder says in the reboot\xe2\x80\x99s second episode. The most satisfying episodes of \xe2\x80\x9cThe X-Files\xe2\x80\x9d don\xe2\x80\x99t tie everything in the world up in a neat bow \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re content to let a few threads dangle.'b'On Wednesday, the New Orleans police 'b'arrested'b' Deonca Kennedy after her 3-year-old grandson was killed by a bullet fired from a gun under her pillow as the two slept.'b'Ms. Kennedy, who was charged with negligent homicide and is indigent, qualified to have a public defender represent her. But the Orleans Public Defenders Office turned her down because, as it had announced on Jan. 11, it 'b'could no longer afford to take on'b' serious new felony cases, including some involving murder, rape and armed robbery.'b'Currently, the office\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers handle an average of 350 felony cases each year, more than twice the American Bar Association\xe2\x80\x99s guideline of 150. It is impossible for them to provide an ethical or constitutionally adequate defense for their existing clients under these conditions, let alone to take on even more. The situation is only getting worse, and the office imposed a hiring freeze because of a $1 million budget shortfall.'b'Since the office represents about 85 percent of criminal defendants in New Orleans and nearly all defendants who are found to be indigent, the impact of the decision to decline new cases has been immediate. Already 15 defendants facing violent felony charges have been turned down. Until the state or the city comes up with money to pay for lawyers whom the Constitution requires the government to provide, these people, including Ms. Kennedy, are locked up in jail without lawyers to challenge their arrests, request reduced bail or file motions to preserve evidence.'b'Despite the 'b'Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee'b' of a lawyer to every person facing criminal charges, underfunded public defense systems are common across America. But perhaps nowhere is the system as perverse as in Louisiana, where most of the funding comes from court costs imposed on those who are convicted or plead guilty, most often in the form of a $45 fee assessed on traffic tickets.'b'This is an inadequate and unpredictable revenue stream; a 'b'2012 report'b' found that the New Orleans traffic court failed to pay the defenders office millions it owed. And using court costs to finance public defense creates a fundamental conflict of interest, since it gives defenders an incentive to lose their cases to ensure that the office gets paid.'b'Last week, the American Civil Liberties Union 'b'brought a class-action lawsuit'b' on behalf of several defendants stuck in jail, alleging violations of their right to due process, equal protection and assistance of counsel. It has brought similar suits in other states, including New York and California, but the problems in Louisiana are especially bad. According to Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s public defender, James Dixon Jr., 31 of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 42 public defender districts will be insolvent, or close to it, within the year.'b'The solution is for Louisiana lawmakers to provide adequate funding to public defender offices statewide, and to give all their citizens the legal assistance the Constitution demands.'b'Given the brittle relations between the Obama administration and Israel, even truth-telling can ignite a firestorm. That happened this week when Daniel Shapiro, Washington\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador in Tel Aviv, 'b'delivered a speech'b' that drew unfair rebukes from Israel\xe2\x80\x99s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his right-wing government.'b'Speaking at a security conference, Mr. Shapiro said, correctly, that Israel\xe2\x80\x99s quick-moving expansion of settlements on Palestinian lands \xe2\x80\x9craises honest questions about Israel\xe2\x80\x99s long-term intentions\xe2\x80\x9d and commitment to a two-state solution. What really enraged his critics was an observation that during a time of increased violence in Israel and the West Bank, \xe2\x80\x9cToo many attacks on Palestinians lack a vigorous investigation or response by Israeli authorities, too much vigilantism goes unchecked, and at times there seem to be two standards of adherence to the rule of law: one for Israelis and another for Palestinians.\xe2\x80\x9d A statement from Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s office denounced the second comment as \xe2\x80\x9cunacceptable and incorrect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Considering the relentless violence and attacks on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s very existence, Israelis are understandably on high alert to defend themselves. On the day Mr. Shapiro spoke, an Israeli mother of six, who was killed by a Palestinian terrorist, was buried, and a pregnant woman was injured 'b'in a separate attack'b'. But Palestinians have been victims of assaults and acts of vandalism by Jewish extremists, including an arson attack in July that killed a toddler and his parents in the West Bank village of Duma. None of this is acceptable.'b'The criticism of Mr. Shapiro, a vigorous advocate for Israel, was unusually personal and unfair. He correctly identified a serious problem. Since 1967, there has been a dual legal system in the West Bank in which Palestinians are subject to military courts, where, experts say, they are almost always convicted. Israeli settlers fall under the Israeli civilian judicial system, with its greater rights and protections. The disparity is likely to become more acute if Israelis abandon the two-state solution in favor of a single state, as some in Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet desire.'b'Mr. Shapiro called indictments in the Duma case an important sign of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to prosecute acts of terror against Palestinians, and he urged Israel to \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop stronger, more credible responses to questions about the rule of law in the West Bank.\xe2\x80\x9d He also said America had been \xe2\x80\x9casking tough questions of the Palestinians and of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Arab neighbors, questions about murderous incitement, about withholding recognition, questions about threats to end security cooperation, about support for terror groups and about misuse of the U.N. system.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Israel is moving quickly to establish 'b'facts 'b'on the ground that preclude a Palestinian state, leaving Palestinians increasingly marginalized and despairing. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is starting to look like a de facto annexation,\xe2\x80\x9d one American official said. In a speech last month, Secretary of State John Kerry warned that violence, settlement-building and demolitions of Palestinian homes were \xe2\x80\x9cimperiling the viability of a two-state solution.\xe2\x80\x9d He said the number of settlers had increased by tens of thousands in five years. Thousands of Palestinian homes are said to be pending demolition.'b'Significantly, some Israelis, including some former officials, have expressed growing concerns about their country\xe2\x80\x99s direction. The government is cracking down on Israeli groups that advocate for Palestinian rights and oppose the occupation and settlements. An odious bill introduced by Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked would require activists to wear badges when they met government officials, and if groups received funds from foreign entities, they would have to declare it on all correspondence. The measure, which is clearly intended to intimidate government critics, is expected to pass the Knesset.'b'With only a year left in office, President Obama is unlikely to make another run at a peace process or even apply serious pressure on Israel to halt settlement-building. With the Kerry and Shapiro speeches, the administration is hoping to prod Israelis and Palestinians to think hard about the future they are creating. Tragically, it may already be too late for the one formula that has the best chance of establishing a durable peace: two independent states, side by side.'b'Moscow \xe2\x80\x94 A BRITISH inquiry 'b'announced'b' this week that Alexander V. Litvinenko, a Russian security officer turned defector who died in a London hospital of polonium poisoning in 2006, was \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d murdered on the instructions of President Vladimir V. Putin. That\xe2\x80\x99s little surprise. For more than eight years the world has suspected that the Kremlin was behind the assassination. (Just as surely, Mr. Putin has denied his responsibility. His spokesman Dmitri Peskov denounced the inquiry as a \xe2\x80\x9cquasi investigation\xe2\x80\x9d and an expression of the \xe2\x80\x9celegant British sense of humor.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'In the years since Mr. Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s dramatic death by radioactive poison, Russia\xe2\x80\x99s government has engaged in an array of brazen acts: cyberattacks on Estonia in 2007, the invasion of Georgia in 2008 and covert operations to annex Crimea and destabilize Ukraine in 2014.'b'So was Mr. Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s assassination the start of a new era of dirty tricks?'b'It may have seemed like a good idea at the time and probably in the immediate aftermath; the Russian government viewed it as a success that deterred others in the rich Russian \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 community of \xe2\x80\x9cLondongrad\xe2\x80\x9d from opposition activities. But the political price Moscow paid was considerable; it solidified the image of Mr. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s Russia as a rogue state.'b'Mr. Putin might like to act as if Russia is a world unto itself. It\xe2\x80\x99s not. Modern Russia is thoroughly integrated into global markets and institutions. It seeks foreign investors and partners abroad. Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s elites vacation in Italy, bank in London and send their children to American universities. They can\xe2\x80\x99t afford the repercussions of transnational assassination plots.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s why, since Mr. Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s murder, the Russian security forces have moved on to a rather different tradecraft. \xe2\x80\x9cWet work\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the Russian spy slang for murder \xe2\x80\x94 isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely a thing of the past, of course. A 'b'number of Chechens'b' in Turkey believed to be supporting rebels inside Russia have discovered that. But even in those cases, there was none of the theatricality of a polonium poisoning.'b'Mr. Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s killing, after all, was primarily about silencing critics and scaring opponents rather than eliminating one man. Moscow has realized that in the age of the Internet and 24-hour news cycles, there are safer ways of doing the same thing.'b'These days, if there is assassination to be done in the West, it is of character. The F.S.B. (the successor to the K.G.B.) and the other security services have moved into the world of information operations, and Russian media and public affairs specialists now rank alongside spies and assassins as weapons of the state. Glossy foreign-language media outlets, serried 'b'ranks of paid Internet trolls and hackers'b' and mysteriously well-funded political fringe groups do the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s bidding.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily a reason to celebrate. While it\xe2\x80\x99s true that no one dies from a hacked website, this campaign to dismay, divide and distract the West may be more destructive than any one assassination.'b'One of Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s aims is deepening divisions among its rivals. As in the Cold War, the crucial battleground is in Europe. The Kremlin knows that it will win if the European Union breaks apart or becomes unmanageable \xe2\x80\x94 or if Europeans become disillusioned with the NATO alliance. To this end, Moscow eagerly supports extremist parties, divisive groups and separatist movements across the Continent. France\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cEuroskeptic\xe2\x80\x9d National Front party, for example, 'b'has received Russian money'b'.'b'Meanwhile, the F.S.B. reportedly recruits and directs hackers to set off cyberattacks when it wants to punish or silence Russia\xe2\x80\x99s rivals. When the European Parliament and Commission began to criticize Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s takeover of Crimea in April 2014, for example, its systems were hit by networks of computers running a Russian-designed program called BlackEnergy. At the end of 2015, the 'b'same malware hit Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s energy companies'b', leaving some 700,000 homes without power. It is not just foreigners who are targets. On the day of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s 2011 parliamentary election, coordinated cyberattacks crashed the websites of much of the country\xe2\x80\x99s liberal media outlets. Internet trolls have reportedly been paid to smear the opposition leader 'b'Alexei A. Navalny'b'. The moral seems clear: Mess with Moscow and bad things will happen.'b'The problem is that liberal countries with open economies, democratic politics and a legal presumption of innocence are far less able to resist these offensives. Money and misinformation move equally fast in the modern world. Proving that an extremist political group or a glib lobbyist is backed by Moscow is often impossible. Indeed, part of the genius of this new model of subversion is that it often can be done in plain sight, coyly wrapping itself in the mantle of free speech.'b'After Mr. Litvinenko\xe2\x80\x99s murder, Britain expelled Russian diplomats, limited visas for Russian officials and stopped intelligence sharing and police cooperation. After a hacking attack on American banks in 2014 that the F.B.I. and other agencies'b' suspect was orchestrated by Moscow'b' to punish the United States for placing sanctions on Russia, Washington did nothing but call for investigations and encourage financial institutions to take cybersecurity more seriously.'b'This is the new world of covert war. There are no bodies and no smoking guns, no polonium trails and no easy answers.'b'AS a veteran, I want politicians and public figures to try and understand what military deployment is like, and to relate to my experiences. But I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I want Sarah Palin weighing in.'b'On Wednesday, a day after 'b'endorsing Donald J. Trump'b' for president, the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate attended a Trump rally in Oklahoma. Another member of her family, her son Track, who served in Iraq, had also made news during the week; he was 'b'arrested'b' in a domestic violence case.'b'At the rally, 'b'Mrs. Palin said,'b' \xe2\x80\x9cWhen my own son is going through what he goes though coming back, I can certainly relate to other families who feel these ramifications of PTSD,\xe2\x80\x9d and, she continued, \xe2\x80\x9cit makes me realize more than ever it is now or never for the sake of America\xe2\x80\x99s finest that we have that commander in chief that will respect them and honor them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mrs. Palin seemed to suggest that the policies of President Obama had somehow worsened her son\xe2\x80\x99s condition. And by explaining away domestic violence as the \xe2\x80\x9cramifications of PTSD,\xe2\x80\x9d she intimated that her son\xe2\x80\x99s actions are logical consequences of what he experienced while deployed. This is, of course, a disingenuous argument from a career opportunist. However, in a roundabout way, Mrs. Palin reignited a valuable discussion of combat and its psychological effects. Her portrayal of her son\xe2\x80\x99s condition seems aligned with enduring renditions of veterans as ticking time bombs, as damaged beings primed to harm.'b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t offer any grandiose pronouncements on the topic, and I\xe2\x80\x99m not an expert on the levels of domestic violence among veterans. But I can describe my own experience as someone with post-traumatic stress disorder.'b'Before my deployment to Afghanistan in early 2009, I was stationed in Alaska. My fondest memories of that state involve volunteering at a bicycle co-op the summer before heading overseas. When my tour ended, it took about 10 days to get back to Alaska from Afghanistan. During the long periods of waiting, I daydreamed about what I\xe2\x80\x99d do upon arriving home. The co-op was high on my list.'b'Within a week of my return in March 2010, I visited the co-op at its new, unfamiliar building. I found myself in a hot, loud and crowded room full of aloof young strangers. In that moment, I felt a sudden burst of panic, something completely unexpected. I felt as if I was going to die. I had to leave the room, to return to the safety of my truck parked outside in the snow. Something was very wrong; something about me was clearly defective.'b'This was the first indication that life after combat wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the idyll I had envisioned during my 13 months overseas. And there would be plenty more: When I was confronted with a crisis, it began to feel as if someone had placed a magnifying glass over my normal emotional responses. At times I\xe2\x80\x99d be hyper-alert, at others so brain-fogged that no amount of stimulants could enliven me, and no amount of alcohol could relax me. However, for three years I refused to seek help. I did not want it to affect my military career.'b'What those three years of denial entailed are scenes that I would much rather forget. Later, I realized that many of my friends had experienced similar moments: extreme reactions to emotional stimuli, hours of fear, weeks of hyper-vigilance. The common thread was not a tendency toward violence but rather toward self-hate. There were no flashbacks of combat. There was instead a sinking feeling that I\xe2\x80\x99d always be a downer, always on guard, never able to relax. It was the fear of being permanently broken.'b'In what I decided would be my final year in the military, I sought out mental health care. I received a PTSD diagnosis in June 2013 and left the military a year later; in 2015, the Department of Veterans Affairs rated me at 60 percent disability. I will have access to at least some kind of mental health care for the rest of my life, for which I am immensely grateful. Many veterans who did not seek care before leaving the military (or who were expelled from it) do not have this privilege. That is to say nothing of civilians who suffer the exact same symptoms, and experience the exact same stigma, without any kind of guaranteed care.'b'Because there is a stigma attached to mental health issues, there is a personal and professional risk attached with admitting an unseen ailment. I have the benefit of being a veteran, but I still worry about future graduate school applications or academic job searches. I worry about my own tenuous employment as an adjunct English lecturer. I also know that I\xe2\x80\x99ve managed to improve my symptoms greatly by seeking counseling, avoiding destructive behaviors and writing about my experiences. I can function in society because I was able to seek care, and I want to make that care more accessible to people who need it.'b'That process begins by speaking frankly. Facing up to destructive or abusive behavior comes next, along with the assertion that we are responsible for our actions, no matter what burdens we carry. Post-traumatic stress is no excuse for violence or abuse, nor should it be considered a default association. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hope that, beneath the bluster and the political talking points, Sarah Palin understands this. I hope even more that her son seeks care and finds peace.'b'In the winter of 1985 my hometown, Buffalo, was engulfed in a blizzard \xe2\x80\x94 not an uncommon occurrence for the region, which is justly famed for epic snows. But this was a big one, and the city\xe2\x80\x99s blustery Irish-American mayor, Jimmy Griffin, was at pains to persuade people to stop trying to go about their business as conditions deteriorated. He urged Buffalonians to \xe2\x80\x9crelax, stay inside and grab a six-pack,\xe2\x80\x9d which must be the best advice any elected official ever gave the public in an emergency situation.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s something cartoonish about the menace of a blizzard, in which nature\xe2\x80\x99s wrath assumes a fluffy, roly-poly form and tries to kill you. It\xe2\x80\x99s the meteorological equivalent of getting smothered in 'b'Tribbles'b', or attacked by the 'b'Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man'b'. And yet, kill it does, via car accidents and heart attacks and other misadventures, usually involving people trying, unwisely, to do something.'b'Mr. Griffin, henceforth known as Jimmy Six-Pack, understood this. The Snow Gods reserve special contempt for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t respect their ability to bring human activity to a standstill. The snow cares not for your deadlines, your happy hour plans, your scheduled C-section. It wants only to fall on the ground and lie there. And it wants you to, too.'b'Needless to say, you should. Unless you\xe2\x80\x99re a plow driver or a parka-clad elected official trying to look essential, one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to do battle against a blizzard. You submit. Surrender. 'b'Hunker down'b'. A snowstorm rewards indolence and punishes the go-getters, which is only one of the many reasons it\xe2\x80\x99s the best natural disaster there is.'b'Jimmy Six-Pack also understood that snow functions as an arbiter of government effectiveness. (He stayed in office for 16 years.) In New York City, Mayor John Lindsay\xe2\x80\x99s lax response to a 1969 storm forever dinged his political fortunes. Cities need blizzards every few years to flush out incompetents, expose incipient dysfunction and generally stress-test the fabric of civilization. Like war, illness and poker, snow ruthlessly reveals true character.'b'And, gloriously if briefly, it hides everything else \xe2\x80\x94 the plastic grocery bags and mini-marts and dog poop and salt-grimed Toyotas and sundry disorder of modernity. Watching the quotidian American crudscape transform into a fairy-tale kingdom is a legitimate wonder. Name another disaster that leaves the afflicted region 'b'more 'b'attractive in its wake.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve never quite lost my amazement at this phenomenon, the suddenness with which the familiar vanishes and a new, better landscape appears. Time has partly buried my childhood memories of Buffalo\xe2\x80\x99s mighty blizzard of 1977, but I still recall the hallucinogenic dislocation of the great drifts that climbed over houses, the spectacle of a world made thrillingly new. It\xe2\x80\x99s a vision that seems freshly haunting now, as we face the dread prospect of a climate changed by human appetites \xe2\x80\x94 the future winters, soggy and snowless, that await us all.

Aid is based on need and consists entirely of grants. No student is required to take out loans.'b'Over all, nearly 60 percent of students receive grant aid, and on average their families pay $12,000 a year for tuition, room, board and fees combined. For nearly 20 percent of students \xe2\x80\x94 those from families with the most modest incomes \xe2\x80\x94 the expected family contribution is zero.'b'All this is possible because of the income generated by the university\xe2\x80\x99s endowment and the generous yearly contributions for student aid from Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s alumni and friends.

The growing tensions between Okinawans who don\xe2\x80\x99t want any base at all and Japanese and American officials who say a base is crucial for security have made any resolution seem out of reach. Now, there are some signs of new thinking that could potentially reduce the friction and pry the plan out of its political vise.'b'The election in Ginowan, a crowded city on Okinawa\xe2\x80\x99s main island, pits Atsushi Sakima, the incumbent who is supported by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, against Keiichiro Shimura, a former Okinawan government official. Mr. Sakima has endorsed the Japan-American plan to move the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma to Henoko Bay and return the existing location to Okinawans; Mr. Shimura wants the base out of Okinawa altogether, as do Gov. Takeshi Onaga and a majority of Okinawans. To bolster his ally\xe2\x80\x99s chances in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s voting, Mr. Abe has pulled out all the stops, offering Okinawa a bigger budget, support for construction of a Disney resort and aid for the island\xe2\x80\x99s poor children, Reuters reported.'b'Opponents saying moving the base to Henoko just shifts the dangers, noise and environmental degradation to another part of the island. Any plan must work hard to answer their concerns.'b'A report by the Sasakawa Peace Foundation USA endorses the Henoko plan, which also calls for relocating thousands of American Marines to Guam, Hawaii and Australia, as the \xe2\x80\x9conly realistic\xe2\x80\x9d solutions to the demands of lessening Okinawa\xe2\x80\x99s burden and meeting security needs.

But the allies have little hope of retaining popular support for the base unless they do more to help local communities thrive. The report says that requires some \xe2\x80\x9cquick wins,\xe2\x80\x9d like developing housing at the Futenma site to demonstrate the benefits that can come when military bases are returned to civilian uses.'b''b'Flaws in the Iranian Nuclear Deal'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9cIran opens for business\xe2\x80\x9d (Jan. 19) by Roger Cohen: Whatever the merits of the nuclear agreement with Iran, it is profoundly flawed in one area \xe2\x80\x94 it fails to take into account the safety and human rights of Iranians, Americans and the other people around the world who are endangered by Iran\xe2\x80\x99s egregious attacks on civilians, often through proxy forces.'b'The deal may have avoided war, but it also provides Iran with access to billions of dollars that can be used to fund the killing of innocent civilians in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Israel, and in the Gaza Strip and West Bank as part of the Iranian regime\xe2\x80\x99s aggressions against those who do not share its intolerant religious, moral and political ideology.'b'Mr. Cohen castigates those who criticized the deal as being pessimistic.

In Paris, last year started and ended with devastating terrorist attacks. As we all expect another assault anytime anywhere, amid persistent economic gloom and an unsolved migrant crisis, wishing the best for 2016 has become an inconvenient rite. The French radio host Philippe Meyer has taken to wishing his listeners \xe2\x80\x9ca better year than the one we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This minor discomfort happens to betray a deeper reality, which is only starting to sink in: The events of 2015 changed our lives in a much more fundamental way than we like to admit. By \xe2\x80\x9cevents,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean more than the massacres at Charlie Hebdo, Hyper Cacher and the Bataclan. I mean the attacks in Tunis, Bamako, Jakarta, Istanbul, Ouagadougou, all those foreign places where Europeans and locals can be killed together.

I mean our jihadist fellow countrymen and women. I mean the rise of the far right and populist parties.'b'By \xe2\x80\x9cour lives,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean more than French lives.

All European Union countries \xe2\x80\x94 except maybe for a handful of post-Communist member states \xe2\x80\x94 are now affected by the terrorist threat or the migrant crisis, or both. Our hopes that the two could be distinct were dashed when the French police identified two of the Paris assassins as men who had arrived in Europe via the \xe2\x80\x9cmigrant route.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We are all Europeans, united by our geographic proximity to the chaotic Middle East, facing multiple challenges to our common cultural identity.'b'Part of our \xe2\x80\x9cnew normal\xe2\x80\x9d is now visible. Soldiers have been protecting our synagogues and mosques for a year. We learned to open our bags for a security guard; now we also open our coats to show we are not hiding an explosive belt. The chiefs of police and emergency services have reassessed their priorities; editors have reassigned reporters. French Jews are debating whether to give up wearing a yarmulke following the terrorist slashing of a Jewish teacher in Marseille, or keep it on, defiantly: In a poll, 70 percent of the French say they should keep it. Germany has hired 8,500 teachers to help with some 200,000 children of foreign refugees entering the school system this year.'b'Politicians are busy reviewing legislation to give more powers to anti-terrorist forces. To deter migrants, Sweden has imposed checks on its border with Denmark, which has in turn imposed checks on its border with Germany. Proposals that would have seemed completely off the wall a year ago are now being discussed in all seriousness, like seizing cash and valuables from asylum seekers (Denmark), interning those who arrive without passports (Germany), or stripping French citizenship from dual nationals convicted of terrorist acts.'b'Terrorism and Europe\xe2\x80\x99s biggest migration crisis since World War II frame the political debate in and among many E.U. countries.

All agree that national intelligence services don\xe2\x80\x99t cooperate closely enough, but who will cede sovereignty on this sensitive activity? There is no common immigration or asylum policy, but how can we agree on one?'b'Beneath the surface of the new normal lie even more uncomfortable challenges. The public reaction to this situation, particularly in France and Germany, reveals a crucial dilemma: How, as a society, do we make necessary adjustments without betraying the values that define us? This question is at the heart of a passionate debate in France over where to stop the pendulum\xe2\x80\x99s swing between security and liberty; many of those who cherish their liberties struggle with the feeling that, at the moment, they value their security even more. Political elites may hate it, but polls show that proposals like depriving certain terrorists of French citizenship enjoy popular support.'b'Mourad Benchellali, a French former Guant\xc3\xa1namo inmate, who was released in 2004 and jailed in France until 2006, has experienced this changing sentiment first hand.

How do you ensure that hard-won women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and freedom are not endangered? How do you teach cultural norms?'b'These are difficult questions \xe2\x80\x94 and they are being asked all over Europe.

Wave love, he observes, \xe2\x80\x9cis a one way street.\xe2\x80\x9d The wave, implacable, will turn on you. \xe2\x80\x9cScenes feel mythic even as they unfold. I always feel a ferocious ambivalence: I want to be nowhere else; I want to be anywhere else.\xe2\x80\x9d One near- escape produces this catharsis: \xe2\x80\x9cOn my knees in the sand, in the twilight, absolutely spent, I was surprised to find myself sobbing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What my son Blaise, who is 21, asked was whether it\xe2\x80\x99s still possible to have such adventures. He thought not \xe2\x80\x94 too much control, too much Google Earth. I suggested he might be wrong and that, on graduation, he might drive from New York to Patagonia. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to experience that \xe2\x80\x9cferocious ambivalence,\xe2\x80\x9d the threshold of freedom.'b'WITH the protests in Ferguson, Mo., the Black Lives Matter movement and the massacre of black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., on their minds, the presidents of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s two major Baptist groups \xe2\x80\x94 one predominantly white, one predominantly black \xe2\x80\x94 decided it was time for a bold gesture. The Southern Baptist Convention, founded by slaveholders and their supporters before the Civil War, is now the nation\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest Christian denomination after the Roman Catholic Church. Black Baptists formed their own churches and in 1880 founded what eventually became the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A.'b'Late last year, the leaders each invited 10 of their pastors to join in a public conversation on racial reconciliation in Jackson, Miss. The Rev. Dr. Ronnie Floyd, president of the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Rev. Dr. Jerry Young, president of the National Baptist Convention, U.S.A., visited The New York Times recently to discuss the Jackson meeting, and the goals behind it. An edited version of their conversation follows.'b''b'Q.'b' What was it like being in that room?'b''b'YOUNG'b' For me personally, it was almost euphoric. Literally to be in that room dealing with that particular issue in light of my own personal history and the history of Mississippi, and Southern Baptist history. That moment was filled with hope and a tremendous sense of possibility.'b''b'Q.'b' You\xe2\x80\x99ve told me that you were born on a plantation in the Mississippi Delta and grew up experiencing racism. Did you tell the Southern Baptists about those experiences?'b''b'YOUNG'b' In the little town I grew up in, Lamont, just north of Greenville, there were three stores, and I remember distinctly once, we went into one store and there was an elderly man there. They had a cooler where you got the sodas and took them to the counter. The man went and picked up a Coke and went to the counter, and the person behind the counter refused to sell him the Coke because it was a white man\xe2\x80\x99s drink. He had to put it back in the cooler.'b''b'Q.'b' Reverend Floyd, why did you, as a white Southern Baptist, want to sit down with African-American Baptists?'b''b'FLOYD'b' I had been deeply grieved by what I had seen happening in this country, ever since the events of Ferguson. And then the Charleston shooting, which broke our hearts. The Southern Baptist Convention has 51,094 churches, and out of that, 10,300 of them are nonwhite churches, so we really want deeply to move forward in reaching multiethnic people, nonwhite people.'b''b'Q.'b' Is that part of the motivation for doing this racial reconciliation effort, that you\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to grow your own denomination?'b''b'FLOYD'b' It\xe2\x80\x99s not our motive. We believe that God is sovereign over all affairs, and God miraculously led us together. I wrote an article helped by several nonwhite leaders in our denomination, along with a couple of guys that look like me, and it was a response to the Ferguson issue. And it just caught lots of fire, in a good way. It ended up being featured in an African-American magazine, and they sent me a copy of it. And there\xe2\x80\x99s Jerry Young on the front cover, bigger than Dallas. Then they got my picture down here in a little thing, talking about me speaking on racism. And I just got to tell you, that\xe2\x80\x99s one of the greatest pictures I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had. And I mean that. Because 'b'[turning to Mr. Young]'b' I love you and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know you. But that day when I got that magazine I wrote you a congratulatory letter, and from that moment the Lord put us together.'b''b'YOUNG'b' I am convinced that if we don\xe2\x80\x99t get this racism issue right in the church, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think there\xe2\x80\x99s any way we can do it in the culture. The church has a checkered past, even now, with racism, no question. And that\xe2\x80\x99s not just white racism. It\xe2\x80\x99s racism period.'b''b'Q.'b' Are you saying the black church also has a problem with racism?'b''b'YOUNG'b' Sure, we all have a problem with racism, in a different way of course. There are some African-Americans who have had some real serious problems with the white church, with the Southern Baptist church for instance. Even in my own denomination, there are people right now who can\xe2\x80\x99t overcome the history. And for them, the history has become a serious stumbling block. In fact I\xe2\x80\x99ve never said this to Dr. Floyd, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve had fellows in my own denomination who called me and said: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing? I mean, are you not aware of the history?\xe2\x80\x9d And I say, obviously I\xe2\x80\x99m aware. They bring up the issue about slavery and that becomes a reason, they say, that we ought not to be involved with the Southern Baptists. Where from my vantage point, that\xe2\x80\x99s reverse racism. I do understand the history, and I understand the pain of the past. But what I\xe2\x80\x99m also quite clear about is, if the Gospel does anything at all, the Gospel demands that we not only preach but practice reconciliation.'b''b'Q.'b' The Southern Baptist Convention does have quite a history of racism.'b''b'FLOYD'b' Yes, and I\xe2\x80\x99m deeply regretful for that. The Southern Baptist Convention was formed in 1845. I can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything about what happened in 1845, but I can do a lot about where we are today in 2015. My church has a lot of people that are not white. We live in the homeland of Walmart, J. B. Hunt, Tyson Foods and the University of Arkansas. And with the growth of those companies, our whole region has changed. And in order for us to reach our region, we have to be able to reach all people.'b''b'YOUNG'b' I\xe2\x80\x99ve had this question asked of me about the motive. And my answer has been, one, I actually do believe in Dr. Floyd. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s honest, a fine Christian gentleman. But if the motive is not pure, I tell people all the time, if in the end, good comes out of it, the community is blessed, the church, the culture, America is made better, even if people have impure motives. Because I do believe it is so critical. America in my opinion is a powder keg. This racial thing is some awesome stuff.'b''b'Q.'b' The presidential campaign has gotten very nasty, with racial overtones. Some of the candidates \xe2\x80\x94 Gov. Mike Huckabee, Senator Ted Cruz \xe2\x80\x94 who have spoken most harshly about President Obama are Southern Baptists.'b''b'YOUNG'b' I think the tone of the public rhetoric incites racism. I think it gives persons who want to be racist a sense that it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. to do this. It empowers them and they\xe2\x80\x99re emboldened by it.'b''b'FLOYD'b' I\xe2\x80\x99m a Baptist pastor, I\xe2\x80\x99m not in politics. But I would say that Governor Huckabee and Senator Cruz have got to answer for themselves. I told my people numerous times, don\xe2\x80\x99t call the president by his last name alone. Regardless if you believe in his politics or you don\xe2\x80\x99t, he is President Obama. I talked to them about the importance of preserving the office.'b''b'YOUNG'b' That\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right.'b''b'FLOYD'b' Because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t model that with the leader of the nation, you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to model it to your teachers in your schools, to your bosses on your jobs.'b''b'Q.'b' Are there concrete things you see your churches taking on together? What about issues like criminal justice or sentencing reform?'b''b'FLOYD'b' We\xe2\x80\x99re going to encourage our pastors to swap pulpits, get them in uncomfortable or at least different environments than they\xe2\x80\x99re used to.'b''b'YOUNG'b' I will only go to Arkansas if he comes to Mississippi.'b''b'FLOYD'b' It will be a joy to come to Mississippi.'b''b'YOUNG'b' Fellowshipping is what he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about. We\xe2\x80\x99ve agreed to that. He\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely correct: Suspicion, fear, distrust, all that stuff is there. How do you get beyond that if you don\xe2\x80\x99t get to know people?'b'IN 2006, I sentenced a man to 18 years in prison. I have been wrestling with that decision ever since.'b'As a federal district judge, I\xe2\x80\x99ve sentenced hundreds of people, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve rarely agonized as much as I did over this man\xe2\x80\x99s fate.'b'He was the enforcer for a brutal gang of drug dealers in Bridgeport, Conn., known as the Terminators, and had sold heroin, assaulted rival dealers and murdered a potential witness. But after a falling-out with the head of the gang, he turned over a stash house to the police and fled the state. When captured in 2001, he immediately confessed to the murder and later testified as a star witness for the prosecution.'b'Thus arose my problem: He had committed horrible crimes, but he also seemed to be making an unusually sincere effort to atone for them. So which man was I sentencing? The murderer or the remorseful cooperator?'b'The prosecutor rewarded his cooperation by filing a so-called 5K motion, which allowed me to ignore the mandatory life sentence he otherwise would have faced. Still, after weighing the seriousness of his crimes, I sentenced him to 18 years, which was more time than even the prosecutor wanted.'b'I gave a speech encouraging the defendant to make the most of his time in prison. He promised to work hard and ready himself to lead a productive life after his release. But nearly everyone I sentence says something similar.'b'In the years that followed, I often wondered whether his remorse was strong enough to overcome his past.'b'In 2012, I had the chance to find out. While attending a conference on sentencing issues, I learned that he was serving time in a prison nearby. I wanted to know whether he had become a better citizen or a better criminal. So I asked a prison staffer if I could meet with him in private.'b'That the warden felt no need to post a guard was my first clue that he had changed for the better. He was working in his first real job at the prison industries factory and had been promoted to supervisor. He showed me recommendations from prison employees for good jobs on the outside. He brought a folder full of certificates he had earned for attending classes. He talked lovingly about his girlfriend and daughter, with whom he planned to live as a family after his release.'b'The meeting made me proud of his accomplishments, but sad that I had not been more confident in him. He still had several years left on his sentence, but it was clear that he had served enough time.'b'After I returned to my office, I contacted the prosecutor and his lawyer and encouraged them to find a way to get him released early. But they told me there was no straightforward way to shorten a federal inmate\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, even if prison officials acknowledge that more jail time is a waste of time and money. So he had to stay in prison, at an annual cost of $30,000 to taxpayers.'b'The tragedy of mass incarceration has recently focused much attention on the need to reform three-strikes laws, mandatory minimums and the federal-sentencing guidelines, which often direct judges to impose excessive sentences. We also need a mechanism for judges to re-evaluate the sentences they\xe2\x80\x99ve imposed.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true that federal prisoners can earn up to 15 percent off the length of their sentences if they stay out of trouble. But this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t incentivize prisoners to take advantage of work or study opportunities.'b'Instead, Congress should enact legislation that would allow every sentenced defendant one opportunity to petition his sentencing court for a reduction based on extraordinarily good conduct and rehabilitation in prison.'b'This \xe2\x80\x9csecond-look review\xe2\x80\x9d should be available only to prisoners who are supported by their wardens. To minimize the increased workload on busy federal judges, each prisoner should be allowed only a single opportunity to seek early release and do so only after serving at least half of the sentence imposed (or two-thirds of a mandatory minimum sentence).'b'Factors in support of an early release should include more than just clean disciplinary records in prison. Job readiness, success with drug treatment, completion of vocational and educational training and extraordinary family or health circumstances should count as well.'b'While the Bureau of Prisons has the authority under the existing \xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate release\xe2\x80\x9d program to do much of what I advocate, that program has been used far too sparingly, in part because of bureaucratic hurdles. From 2008 to 2014, only 11 of the thousands of prisoners sentenced by federal courts in New York have been released under this program. Most of them were terminally ill. Compassionate release provides no realistic way out of prison. And prisoners with no reason to hope have little reason to reform.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t advocate for a return to the flawed federal parole system that was essentially abolished in the 1980s. In that system, a judge who believed that a defendant should spend three years locked up would impose a nine-year sentence because parole was likely to be granted after he served one-third of it. But if that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s parole was delayed or denied, the judge\xe2\x80\x99s original intent was impeded. In contrast, my proposal would give the sentencing judge control. This makes sense because judges know whether a particular defendant got a break at sentencing or not and can best gauge the extent of positive change in a person.'b'The man I sentenced in 2006 will soon leave prison. Counting the time he served in custody before sentencing and time off for good behavior, he is scheduled to be released in April. In total, he will have served over 14 years. The last three years of that sentence, if not more, were a waste of time.'b'Upon his release, I will reach out to express my regret for rejecting the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s request for leniency. And I will thank him for inciting my interest in this reform.'b'A \xe2\x80\x9csecond look\xe2\x80\x9d to adjust sentences would give inmates an incentive to prepare themselves for productive lives on the outside, and allow judges like me to correct sentences that turn out, in hindsight, to be unnecessarily long. This would improve the fairness of our criminal justice system and increase the public\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in our courts.'b'REMEMBER the poll last week that had Bernie Sanders ahead of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire by three points?'b'No, you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got it wrong. Sanders was up by 27.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s true, if you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the figures that CNN and WMUR released on Tuesday. I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about the ones that Gravis Marketing and One America News Network released on 'b'Wednesday'b'.'b'There were three polls of New Hampshire voters over just two days last week, according to 'b'the archive'b' maintained by Real Clear Politics. There were three polls of Iowa voters on Thursday alone. One had Clinton up by eight, while another had Sanders up by that same margin. One had Donald Trump up by 11. Another had Ted Cruz up by two.'b'Over a monthlong period ending Thursday night \xe2\x80\x94 a monthlong period, mind you, that included the Christmas and New Year\xe2\x80\x99s break \xe2\x80\x94 there were 11 polls in Iowa, 10 in New Hampshire and nine nationally. There were polls focused on 10 different states.'b'And their findings were often treated as breathless news. On Wednesday evening, I visited the home page of the 'b'Politico'b' website \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m using Politico as a random example \xe2\x80\x94 and spotted four stories that were essentially about poll results.'b'My television was on: The 'b'CNN'b' anchor Erin Burnett began her show with a report on the latest poll.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d say that we\xe2\x80\x99re in a period of polling bloat, but bloat is too wan a word. Where polling and the media\xe2\x80\x99s attention to it are concerned, we\xe2\x80\x99re gorging ourselves into a state of morbid obesity.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen anything like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ralph Reed, a longtime Republican strategist who thought that things were bad in 2008 and 2012 and realizes now that those were days of temperance and innocence, to be pined for and perhaps never savored again.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the crazy bounty of polls that fascinates him (and me) most. It\xe2\x80\x99s something else.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere seems to be an inverse relationship between the preponderance of polling and the 'b'reliability'b' of polling,\xe2\x80\x9d Reed said, nailing one of the most illogical, paradoxical dynamics of the 2016 election so far.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re leaning harder than ever on polling precisely when that makes the least sense. We\xe2\x80\x99re wallowing in polls even as they come to wildly different conclusions that should give us serious pause.'b'Good polls are arguably 'b'more difficult than ever'b' to do, for reasons I\xe2\x80\x99ll go into later. And from 2012 forward, there have been 'b'prominent examples'b' of how poorly they sometimes predict outcomes. They botched the most recent parliamentary elections in Britain and Israel. They botched the 2014 midterms in the United States, grossly miscalculating the margins in various congressional and gubernatorial races.'b'Last year, Reed noted, the Real Clear Politics average of polls in the Kentucky governor\xe2\x80\x99s race had the Democrat, Jack Conway, ahead of the Republican, Matt Bevin, by five points.'b'Bevin won by nearly nine.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was 14 points off,\xe2\x80\x9d Reed marveled. \xe2\x80\x9cBut everybody shrugs and moves on down the highway.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are explanations for those shrugs, and they speak to the quirks and flaws of political journalism in a wired, revved-up world.'b'There are consequences, too. An obsession with polls and a quickness to weave narratives around them bolster certain candidates and retard others, and could well affect the outcome of this presidential election.'b'If Donald Trump wins the Republican nomination \xe2\x80\x94 or, heaven forbid, the White House \xe2\x80\x94 it will be partly because we in the media justified saturation coverage of him by pointing to polls, which in turn legitimized 'b'his'b' 'b'fixation'b' on them as proof that he\xe2\x80\x99s up to the job: He must be, because plenty of people apparently picture him in it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe 'b'caresses 'b'his polls numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d said David Axelrod, one of the chief architects of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns, adding that Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first order of business when he steps up to a microphone is \xe2\x80\x9ca recitation of poll numbers. He\xe2\x80\x99s like a Lothario recounting his exploits every time he starts a speech.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy comes to naught, his underwhelming poll numbers \xe2\x80\x94 and how they were used to cast him instantly as an underachiever \xe2\x80\x94 will have been a factor. And if Clinton fails to win the nomination, the media\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of certain polls among an ever-changing riot of them will have played at least some small role.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf she\xe2\x80\x99s three points behind in New Hampshire, it\xe2\x80\x99s a close race,\xe2\x80\x9d Axelrod said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if she\xe2\x80\x99s 27 points behind, her campaign\xe2\x80\x99s in free fall. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sexier story and the one that\xe2\x80\x99s chosen. It becomes the meme. It becomes the prism through which everyone filters their coverage. It skews how people view everything that a candidate does: Is it conviction or desperation?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Desperation makes a better story. So the media dwells on the most pessimistic projections, ensuring that polling, no matter how divorced from reality, shapes it.'b'Polls determined which Republican candidates participated in which debates, although just a couple of percentage points \xe2\x80\x94 the margin of error, really \xe2\x80\x94 separated a few of the prime-time debaters from the early birds.'b'Some of these polls were national ones, which have minimal relevance to the decisive, trajectory-setting contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA national poll is absolutely meaningless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Romney\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 campaign. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of every nine Americans lives in California. So one of every nine voters in that poll is going to be in California. When\xe2\x80\x99s the last time anybody read a story about the Republican primary in California?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And if you dig below the surface of these national polls \xe2\x80\x94 or of polls in the states with the first contests \xe2\x80\x94 you find a crucial detail that we in the media blithely gloss over: Many, if not most, voters haven\xe2\x80\x99t made up their minds. In last week\xe2\x80\x99s CNN/WMUR poll of New Hampshire voters, for example, about one in three Republicans said that they had definitely decided on a candidate.'b'Part of what I find so jarring about the media\xe2\x80\x99s insatiable appetite for polls right now is that it defies our past resolutions to go on a desperately needed diet. For all of my 30 years as a journalist, I\xe2\x80\x99ve listened to reporters, editors and producers bemoan the \xe2\x80\x9chorse-race coverage\xe2\x80\x9d of campaigns and exhort one another to be better come the next election and concentrate instead on issues, records, biographies, substance.'b'Suddenly the apologies and exhortations are gone. We\xe2\x80\x99re worse. Every candidate\xe2\x80\x99s a thoroughbred, every day the Kentucky Derby and just about every other story on many newscasts and news sites an assessment of his or her odds. We\xe2\x80\x99re resigned to treating campaigns as sport. It represents the surest path to a large enough audience to keep a beleaguered industry economically viable.'b'Some dispatches are overt in their reliance on polls, others less so, using polls as the prompts or context for discussions of stalled campaign momentum or new campaign strategies. The Times is guilty. 'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m guilty'b'. Polls are the seemingly irresistible argot of political coverage; to purge them from your vocabulary is to speak in an unrecognizable tongue.'b'BESIDES which, we need the content. In a fast-metabolism world of constantly monitored smartphones and routinely refreshed browsers, news organizations are under greater pressure to produce fresh nuggets of information even as their budgets and resources for reporting decline. So we readily trumpet and analyze polls, a practice that has even given birth and currency to a whole strain of news that\xe2\x80\x99s survey-based, with practitioners who burrow ever deeper into numbers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have a lot of people who don\xe2\x80\x99t ever go out on the campaign trail and actually talk to voters,\xe2\x80\x9d Stevens said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe now call those people data journalists. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to report. It\xe2\x80\x99s a wonderful category.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Our demand for polls guarantees a robust supply of them: Churning these surveys out is great guaranteed publicity for news organizations, research companies and academic institutions. How many Americans are aware of Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Conn., or Monmouth University in West Long Branch, N.J., only because they commission and put their stamps on polls?'b'But not all of the surveys that the media cites are created equal. Gary Langer, the founder of 'b'Langer Research Associates'b' and a former director of polling for ABC News, compared the variable quality of polls to the variable quality of what you eat. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are well-crafted, delicious meals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen there\xe2\x80\x99s fast food. And then there\xe2\x80\x99s listeria.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Listeria is common. People\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on cellphones has complicated polling: Federal law forbids automated calls to such phones, so pollsters must bear the considerable expense of dialing them by hand or, alternately, make do without them, which can lead to imperfect results.'b'Beyond that, there\xe2\x80\x99s the question of whether the kind of people who consent to polls are true weather vanes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe entire industry rests on the idea that the people you get are representative of the people you don\xe2\x80\x99t get,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jon Cohen, who supervised polling for The Washington Post from 2006 to 2013 and is now the vice president of survey research at 'b'SurveyMonkey'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s an increasingly questionable premise and one that I keep in mind every time I design a survey.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople don\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy or even tolerate those conversations the way they used to,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cTaking a survey is a participatory act, and different kinds of people participate in different things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Can we extrapolate from the kinds of people who have been professing adoration of Trump \xe2\x80\x94 or, for that matter, of Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 into the general population? Apart from that, can we trust the constancy of their affections? Will they actually cast votes?'b'Over the next few weeks, we\xe2\x80\x99ll find out, and I promise you this: There will be some surprises. If they\xe2\x80\x99re significant enough, polling could be as big a loser in the 2016 primaries as any candidate is. And we in the media will be forced to apologize anew for our poll-mad behavior. Sadly, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean we\xe2\x80\x99ll change it.'b'MODERN American culture is down on shame \xe2\x80\x94 it is, we are told, a damaging, useless emotion that we should neither feel ourselves nor make others feel. This is particularly the case when it comes to drug and alcohol addiction. The nation\xe2\x80\x99s drug czar, 'b'Michael Botticelli'b', has led a well-intentioned campaign to eradicate feelings of shame in addicted people by, in part, 'b'likening addiction to cancer,'b' a disease outside of people\xe2\x80\x99s control.'b'But in fact, the experience of shame \xe2\x80\x94 the feeling that one has failed to live up to one\xe2\x80\x99s own standards \xe2\x80\x94 can play a positive role in recovery from addiction, as well as from other kinds of destructive habits.'b'Certainly, as a psychiatrist and psychologist, respectively, we have observed the corrosive effects of shame on patients with conditions over which they have scant control, especially those with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. And like most people, we consider it unethical, cruel and clinically pointless to disparage or judge people whose disorders \xe2\x80\x94 severe mental illness, cancer \xe2\x80\x94 are largely or entirely impossible to modify by the sheer force of will.'b'But addiction is different. In sharp contrast to schizophrenics, the afflicted person can take at least partial control of it.'b'Although heavy and repeated drug use alters the brain, especially regions that mediate self-control, the essential question is not whether those neural changes occur. Instead, it is whether they necessarily disable a person\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to reason and to respond to carrots and sticks.'b'A vast literature shows that addiction is an activity whose course can be altered by its foreseeable consequences, including tangible rewards for cutting down on use. In contrast, no amount of reinforcement or punishment can alter the course of an entirely autonomous biological condition, like cancer. You would never bribe a patient with breast cancer to keep her tumor from spreading, or threaten to impose a penalty on her if it did.'b'Indeed, addicts make scores of choices every day. Most heroin addicts, for example, perform some kind of gainful work between shooting up. In the days between binges, cocaine addicts make many decisions as well. One of those decisions could be to enter treatment or to stop on their own.'b'This is not to say that quitting is easy; most people who enter treatment are deeply conflicted about giving up their habits. Still, many addicts have been motivated to quit by a spasm of self-reproach. In his addiction memoir \xe2\x80\x9cThe Night of the Gun,\xe2\x80\x9d the New York Times columnist David Carr 'b'recounted'b' how he decided to kick his drug habit after he realized how profoundly irresponsible he\xe2\x80\x99d been when he locked his twin baby girls in a car while he met with his dealer to score crack.'b'So under what conditions does shame end up prodding people into correcting their course? Alternatively, when does intense self-criticism make matters worse by further fueling an addiction (for example, drinking even more to mute the pain of those shameful feelings)?'b'An important influence appears to be whether people buy into the notion that a habit is under or out of their control. In a meta-analysis \xe2\x80\x94 a mathematical synthesis of previous studies \xe2\x80\x94 just published in The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the University of Connecticut psychologist Colin Leach and one of his doctoral students, Atilla Cidam, 'b'examined'b' the links between shame and \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive approach behaviors,\xe2\x80\x9d such as helping or cooperating with others, apologizing and making amends for one\xe2\x80\x99s failures.'b'They found that study participants who were vulnerable to experiencing shame were less inclined to engage in corrective actions when they believed their mistakes were not fixable, such as when they had no opportunity to apologize to someone they\xe2\x80\x99d offended. In contrast, participants were more inclined to engage in positive behaviors when they thought their errors could be repaired.'b'The lesson is that shame can act as a spur to amend self-inflicted damage when people perceive that damage is fixable and manageable. In light of this finding, comparing addiction to a purely biological disorder, like cancer, might backfire, leading people to see their habits as unalterable.'b'None of this is to say that the culture, as a whole, needs to embrace the scarlet letter. But it does mean that therapists can harness patients\xe2\x80\x99 sense of shame to help them. Consider the patient who feels ashamed because she was \xe2\x80\x9ca bad mother\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 say, she took risks like routinely leaving her baby in the care of abusive adults. She should be helped to realize not only that her shame is realistic, but also that emotions can be signals. In this case, shame is a signal that the best way to mend and manage feelings of self-reproach is to fully commit herself to protecting her children and gaining their trust.'b'In other instances, shame is unwarranted and damaging. A classic example is a patient whose feelings of shame take the form of a conviction that she is inherently unlovable. It is critical for the therapist to help the patient distinguish such inappropriate shame, which goes to the core of self-worth, from realistic self-appraisals that guide restorative actions.'b'Despite its bad reputation, shame is an emotion like most others: It can be beneficial under certain circumstances. If people believe they can change, then shame might help bring that change about.'b'Tom Lutz is editor in chief of The 'b'Los Angeles Review of Books'b'.'b''b'READING'b' The third volume of Jane Smiley\xe2\x80\x99s astounding \xe2\x80\x9cLast Hundred Years\xe2\x80\x9d trilogy.

I can get lost in there for hours \xe2\x80\x94 seeing when we get a little action from the Democratic Republic of Congo or Myanmar and watching the Chinese shut us down and let us back in. It\xe2\x80\x99s endless entertainment. And I am starting to do my quadrennial 'b'Nate Silver'b' impression, gobbling up political polls, putting them through my completely unscientific matrix of second-guessing, and then making pronouncements about who is going to win the presidency and the Senate. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always followed politics. My mother was a 'b'Eugene McCarthy'b' delegate at the 1968 Democratic National Convention.'b''b'TRAVELING'b' I have a deep, almost pathological, wanderlust. It started when I was a kid hitchhiking and riding freight trains around the country. One of the great things about the train is I never really knew where I was going. Still my favorite way to travel is without an itinerary or predetermined goal, and the farther off the beaten path the better. Nothing makes me happier than going to countries at the bottom of other people\xe2\x80\x99s lists. Most recently it was 'b'Belarus'b'. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very rural country with only one big city. And yet they\xe2\x80\x99ve built this amazing 'b'high-tech industry'b'. A surprising 40 percent of the population does brain work.'b'The government of Colombia and the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest guerrilla group have made an 'b'unusual joint request'b' to the United Nations Security Council. Nearing the final stages of an armistice negotiation, the two sides asked the Council to set up a mission of international experts to oversee a critical part of the proposed agreement: disarming the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a Marxist-inspired insurgency.'b'It is a task the United Nations should embrace. The laying-down of arms is a critical prerequisite to a permanent cease-fire.'b'Since 'b'peace talks began'b' in Havana in 2012, the two sides have reached tentative agreements on fighting narcotics traffic, on land reform and on reparations for victims. But realizing these agreements will require peaceful collaboration on both sides, and that depends on the willingness of squads of guerrilla fighters to emerge from the jungle and relinquish their weapons.'b'Considering the lingering mistrust between fighters who have been at war for five decades, this could be a fraught process. Hence the joint request to the United Nations to oversee it. Although President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia hailed the request as a sign that the peace process was 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cincreasingly irreversible,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'the handover of arms will not be easy. FARC leaders have been reluctant to surrender their weapons to the government, arguing that doing so would be seen as an act of defeat. There is currently no agreement on who would take custody of the weapons and what would ultimately happen to them.'b'The Colombian government envisions that the FARC will assemble its fighters in a handful of regions once a final peace agreement is signed and that rank-and-file fighters will start to gradually transition into civilian life. Having teams of international observers present at those sites would increase the likelihood that the process could be carried out in an orderly fashion and that any disputes and unforeseen challenges could be settled quickly.'b'The government has promised to guarantee the safety of the United Nations personnel, who would be unarmed. The parties have asked that the teams include members from Caribbean and Latin American countries. The mission would have a one-year mandate that could be renewed by mutual consent. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon,'b' signaled his support'b' in a statement hailing the request as \xe2\x80\x9cyet another significant step toward the peaceful resolution of the armed conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is rare for combatants to turn to the United Nations by mutual consent for help in carrying out a peace agreement. At a time when the United Nations is struggling to contain conflicts in Libya, Yemen and Syria, the mission to Colombia is a promising opportunity. 'b'Managing a crucial phase of this process would be a powerful symbol that even long and bitter conflicts can end through dialogue.'b''b'THIS is, of course, a pointless column. The Republican presidential race is over, as you may have heard. Donald Trump has the nomination wrapped up \xe2\x80\x94 in the most luxurious, velveteen packaging you\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. You\xe2\x80\x99ve seen his polling lead: It\xe2\x80\x99s yuge. You\xe2\x80\x99ve watched his rallies: They\xe2\x80\x99re even yuger. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from the insiders, the panjandrums, the grand poo-bahs: He\xe2\x80\x99s a man they can do business with; 'b'Bob Dole'b' guarantees it. You\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from Sarah Palin, and when has her political judgment ever failed?'b'But just in case at some point over the next few months of voting (a mere technicality, but you have to let the people have their fun), one of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remaining rivals (I can barely remember their names, to be honest) wanted to waste money running attack ads against him (a strange, antiquated concept, I know), it seems worth suggesting some ideas for how the poor hapless dear might go about it.'b'Thus far Trump has faced two main attacks. First, that he\xe2\x80\x99s an unserious creep who\xe2\x80\x99s temperamentally unsuited for the presidency. Second, that he\xe2\x80\x99s not a real conservative: That he lacks the Reaganite faith, the commitment to the right-wing catechism.'b'These attacks haven\xe2\x80\x99t worked. Of course, they haven\xe2\x80\x99t been offered all that often, or at least not by anyone polling above the single digits. But if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to take a run at the Inevitable Nominee between now and his coronation, you might as well try something new.'b'So think back to that misty time, two years gone, when one of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s current rivals \xe2\x80\x94 Chris Christie, that\xe2\x80\x99s the one \xe2\x80\x94 was seen as the presumptive Republican front-runner. What was the basis of Christie\xe2\x80\x99s appeal? Simply this: He was a jerk, but he was your jerk. He was rude \xe2\x80\x94 but to people who deserved it. He was an S.O.B. \xe2\x80\x94 the S.O.B. the country needed.'b'Then think about why the \xe2\x80\x9cBridgegate\xe2\x80\x9d scandal was devastating to his image. Not because petty political payback is the worst thing in the world. Not because it proved Christie wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a \xe2\x80\x9ctrue conservative.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No, it devastated Christie because it flipped his brand. Instead of the jerk who looks out for the average guy, he became the jerk whose allies had stuck it to commuters. Instead of the tough guy fighting for you, he became the tough guy whose goons would mire their constituents in traffic for a pointless little feud.'b'Now apply that model to the Inevitable Nominee. Calling Trump a creep and jerk and self-promoter clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work, because his voters have decided that someone with his business chops and middle-finger-first attitude is exactly what they need.'b'To attack him effectively, you have to go after the things that people like about him. You have to flip his brand.'b'So don\xe2\x80\x99t tell people that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know the difference between Kurds and the Quds Force. (They don\xe2\x80\x99t either!) Tell people that he isn\xe2\x80\x99t the incredible self-made genius that he plays on TV. Tell them about all the money he inherited from his daddy. Tell them about the 'b'bailouts'b' that saved him from ruin. Tell them about all his cratered companies. Then find people who suffered from those fiascos \xe2\x80\x94 workers laid off following his bankruptcies, homeowners who bought through 'b'Trump Mortgage'b', people who ponied up for sham degrees from 'b'Trump University'b'.'b'Or just take a camera crew around Atlantic City, and slap Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name on what you find.'b'Likewise, don\xe2\x80\x99t get mired in philosophical arguments about big government and crony capitalism. Find the people hurt by Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'attempts to exploit eminent domain'b': The widow whose boarding house he wanted to demolish to make room for a limo parking lot, the small businessmen whose livelihoods he wanted to redevelop out of existence.'b'(One of the Donald\xe2\x80\x99s foredoomed rivals, Ted Cruz, actually just 'b'cut an ad'b' along these lines.

If you want to persuade his voters that his \xe2\x80\x9cNew York values\xe2\x80\x9d are a problem for 'b'them'b', put his 'b'alleged dealings with the Mafia'b' on the table.'b'All of this is not particularly complicated. It\xe2\x80\x99s roughly what the Democrats did to Mitt Romney, rendering him radioactive with many of the same working class voters currently backing Trump.'b'Except with Trump the trick is subtly different. Mitt was a numbers guy, so he was caricatured as a 'b'cruel Scrooge'b'. But Trump is a salesman: That\xe2\x80\x99s been 'b'a big part of his campaign\xe2\x80\x99s success'b'. And how do you flip a salesman\xe2\x80\x99s brand? You persuade people that he\xe2\x80\x99s a con artist, and they\xe2\x80\x99re his marks.'b'Or least that\xe2\x80\x99s what you would do, if the primary campaign weren\xe2\x80\x99t over already.'b'But since it is, I guess I\xe2\x80\x99m just offering general-election advice.

Pregnant women who want a home birth may talk themselves out of it because they aren\xe2\x80\x99t willing to add any extra risk. But Oregon was one of only two states that allowed unlicensed midwives to do home births during the period of this study; might not that alone account for the increased risk?'b'When I was pregnant in 1995 and wanted a home birth for our second child, it was central to my decision-making that 'b'studies'b' were finding comparable risks between planned home births with midwives and hospital births for low-risk pregnancies, especially when a woman had already had her first child. A contented home birth with a pair of highly trained nurse midwives was the result for our family.'b'I hope that the Oregon study is repeated now that midwives must be licensed.

Why the discrepancy between these studies and 'b'findings from the United States'b'?

I was not keen on the idea when my daughter first told me she wanted a home birth, but I kept an open mind. She chose experienced midwives, who made a visit to my home two months before her due date to go over everything we would need to have prepared. I was also reassured because the midwives had a longstanding relationship with a physician who admits to the hospital near my home, and they had a well-defined protocol for transfer in case of complications.'b'My daughter\xe2\x80\x99s due date came and went, and the midwife let her know that if she went two weeks over, she would have to deliver in a hospital.

I thought of the guy known for dropping Band-Aids on women\xe2\x80\x99s desks when the trading floor was cold because he didn\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cwant to be distracted,\xe2\x80\x9d and the many times I had heard a women share an idea at a meeting, only to see later that same idea credited to a man.'b'But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring up any of that. Women like me were \xe2\x80\x9cteam players,\xe2\x80\x9d and I was often complimented on my thick skin. Like members of a dysfunctional family, we kept our secrets to ourselves.'b'Instead, I kept the conversation light. I shared a funny story about my first day on Wall Street, when I opened up a pizza box to find condoms instead of pepperoni slices. Unwrapped. I was \xe2\x80\x9cthe new girl,\xe2\x80\x9d and the guys just wanted to see me blush. I did blush, and I lived.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that bad anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d I said with a laugh.'b'She was horrified. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could you stand that?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStand what?\xe2\x80\x9d I thought to myself. I remembered one guy telling me that we should hire only \xe2\x80\x9cwomen who have brothers.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked if she had any brothers. The pizza incident was nothing compared with everything else she was about to experience. I truly thought we were offering her the job of a lifetime if only she could let the bad stuff slide.'b'At that time, women on Wall Street were earning 55 to 62 cents to every dollar a man in the same position earned. Afterward, Bear Stearns imploded in the mortgage market, and while I stayed close to the markets and the people who worked for them, I left. Children gave me perspective about the price of money. The women labeled stellar successes were giving up more than I was willing to part with. With the benefit of some perspective, I began to think more deeply about what I and my female colleagues had experienced.'b'Hundreds of millions of dollars have been paid out to Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s victims of gender inequality and harassment. Countless books and articles have coached women to lean every which way, to share their domestic duties 50/50, and to demand the bonuses they have earned. Harvard Business School started an initiative to promote the advancement of women. Investment banks formed diversity committees and have taken a more generous stance on maternity leave, and Morgan Stanley, after being forced to settle 'b'a $46 million class-action discrimination suit'b', set up policies to help women succeed.'b'And what is the result of all these steps? While female M.B.A.s seem to be paid almost the same as men in their first job, the chasm appears quickly. According to a 2015 Bloomberg Businessweek 'b'survey'b' that tracked M.B.A. graduates from 2007 to 2009, the women earned, six to eight years later, on average 20 percent less than the guy who sat next to them in class; even more tellingly, female graduates of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s business school, a significant proportion of whom land on Wall Street, earned nearly 40 percent less. How can everything have changed and nothing change at all?'b'Here is one explanation. Like most employees on Wall Street, my young candidate had to sign a 'b'U4, an arbitration agreement'b' that binds a worker to settle any job dispute with her employer in-house. Most people are so happy to have the job, they aren\xe2\x80\x99t worried about the prospect of settling complaints in a conference room, usually with 'b'arbitrators chosen because they are friendly to the bank'b'.'b'In fact, roughly two of every three cases are decided in Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s favor. In addition, half of the arbitration costs are borne by the complainant and what would be a few hundred dollar filing fee in court can quickly escalate to as much as $150,000 out of pocket. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to lose should things not go your way. No wonder this practice is an effective gag for many would-be whistle-blowers.'b'And when the bank is on the losing end? In a deep-pocketed industry like finance, it\xe2\x80\x99s considered cheaper and more efficient to settle than to risk having tales told in a court of law. A Bank of America-Merrill Lynch gender bias case that received class action status 'b'was settled in 2013'b' with as many as 4,800 individual payments totaling $39 million.'b'Many bankers will tell you that a lot of these complaints about harassment and discrimination are false. Indeed, while researching a novel about a woman working on Wall Street, I was told by people in banks\xe2\x80\x99 human resources departments that men are now often afraid of hiring women because of the potential litigation. They fear that even innocently intended comments can result in expensive complaints; that if a woman isn\xe2\x80\x99t working out, and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get promoted, the male employer has a legal problem on his hands. More than once I was told that it\xe2\x80\x99s just easier to fire a guy or \xe2\x80\x94 my favorite line \xe2\x80\x94 that \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s just less drama with men.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jonathan Sack, a lawyer adept at representing both sides of these disputes, told me, \xe2\x80\x9cMen are being told they need to raise the ranks of women and minorities in their departments, but should someone not work out, especially at the more senior levels, employers worry they\xe2\x80\x99ll have a legal issue to contend with.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sack\xe2\x80\x99s firm handled 80 such cases last year alone. I asked what he estimates the number of disputes against investment banks to be last year. \xe2\x80\x9cEasily 5,000,\xe2\x80\x9d he responded. Something is very broken.'b'Fake complaints likely do pollute and confuse the real ones. But this is one reason even the banks should embrace a change. If these complaints were aired in public, instead of behind closed doors, maybe banks would be less quick to settle, discouraging the opportunistic from lodging an unsubstantiated complaint. More important, lawsuits would shine a light onto the hidden stories, the family secrets that prevent banks from moving forward.'b'We need to ban mandatory arbitration, and let employees decide if they want to hash their differences out in a conference room or demand their constitutional right to a day in court.'b'Banks won\xe2\x80\x99t like it at first, but an end to this practice \xe2\x80\x94 through legislation or the courts, if necessary \xe2\x80\x94 would be a more effective cure for discrimination than their current habit of writing checks too meager to hurt them and too useless to root out the problem.'b'Women now receive the majority of college and graduate degrees, and we make the vast bulk of consumer decisions and purchases. 'b'Forty percent of American households'b' with children under 18 have a woman as primary or sole breadwinner. For future generations of women to do better, we must change the culture of institutions like Wall Street.'b'My candidate took the job, and while she was passionate about her work, she was uncomfortable with the raucous trading floor environment, and lasted only five years. While none of us were able to see the details of her sealed complaint, I can easily imagine what it might contain. Many women have shared their stories with me, and they go far beyond exclusion from meetings and golf courses. There was the young banker who was groped publicly to settle a bet about whether her breasts were real, and the senior deal makers who found out their pay was a fraction of their male counterparts\xe2\x80\x99.'b'Whatever her experience, her case went to arbitration. She signed a nondisclosure agreement and took a settlement check. Another case closed. Another brilliant woman\xe2\x80\x99s career on Wall Street ended.'b'Sitka, Alaska \xe2\x80\x94 FROM fall through spring, the fleet of commercial fishing boats here in the panhandle of Alaska stalk winter king salmon. In the mornings prisms of ice sparkle beneath the sodium lights of the docks, where I live on a World War II tugboat with my wife and 8-month-old daughter. This winter I\xe2\x80\x99ve been out a few times fishing on the I Gotta, catching pristine wild salmon, torpedoes of muscle. But the work is slow, five fish a day, and my skipper recently traveled down to Reno, Nev., for knee surgery.'b'Carpeted in rain forest and braided with waterways, southeast Alaska is among the largest wild salmon producers in the world, its tourism and salmon fishing industries grossing about $2 billion a year. But today, the rivers and the salmon that create these jobs \xe2\x80\x94 and this particular way of life, which attracted me from Philadelphia to Sitka almost 20 years ago \xe2\x80\x94 are threatened by Canada\xe2\x80\x99s growing mining industry along the mountainous Alaska-British Columbia border, about a hundred miles east of where I now write.'b'At least 10 underground and open-pit copper and gold 'b'mining projects'b' in British Columbia are up and running, in advanced exploration or in review to be approved. These operations generate billions of tons of toxic mine tailings stored behind massive dams, creating an ecological hazard at the headwaters of Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s major salmon rivers \xe2\x80\x94 the Stikine, Unuk and Taku, which straddle the border with Canada.'b'Despite being subjected to the environmental and health risks of these upstream mining projects, Alaskans have no say in their approval. Which is why fishermen, Alaska native tribes, local municipalities, tourism businesses, our congressional delegation and thousands of individual Alaska residents have been clamoring for the State Department to refer this issue to the International Joint Commission, an American and Canadian advisory body established in 1909 to ensure that neither country pollutes the waters of the other.'b'Last August, on a visit to Alaska, Secretary of State John Kerry addressed the issue: \xe2\x80\x9cDownstream impacts should not be taken lightly by any country anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d But when Alaska\xe2\x80\x99s lieutenant governor, Byron Mallott, visited Washington to ask that the International Joint Commission examine the problem, he returned saying that State Department officials told him that this was a local issue.'b'Concerns about these mining projects are not new. In November 2011, a group of 36 scientists wrote an 'b'open letter'b' to Christy Clark, the premier of British Columbia, warning of the environmental impact of the province\xe2\x80\x99s mining industry. They predicted that \xe2\x80\x9chabitat for salmon and other wildlife will be destroyed\xe2\x80\x9d and that additional effects would include \xe2\x80\x9caltered flow and temperature patterns, disturbance to wildlife interacting with roads, and reduced water quality associated with sedimentation and acid mine drainage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Three years later, in August 2014, a tailings dam at the Mount Polley mine in British Columbia failed. A volume of water equivalent to thousands of Olympic-size swimming pools, laden with sediment and heavy metals, washed away Hazeltine Creek and dumped into Quesnel Lake, a key salmon spawning ground of the Fraser River watershed. According to Jacinda Mack, a member of the Secwepemc Nation, located downriver from Mount Polley, the following summer was the first time in thousands of years that native tribes didn\xe2\x80\x99t gather sockeye salmon, because of concerns over metal in fish tissue. The episode is now considered one of the worst mining spills in North American history.'b'An independent 'b'investigation'b' funded by the government of British Columbia uncovered flaws in how the dam at the Mount Polley mine was built, maintained and operated, and recommended against using similar tailings facilities. The government publicly stated that the recommendations would be implemented. However, shortly after the release of the report, Imperial Metals, the owner of the Mount Polley mine, received a provincial permit to operate an open-pit mine called Red Chris, with a facility similar to that of Mount Polley \xe2\x80\x94 except this one was larger, built to contain highly toxic acidic tailings, and made use of an existing freshwater trout lake. So long, trout.'b'Today, the Red Chris mine processes 30,000 tons of ore a day \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of three Eiffel towers \xe2\x80\x94 about 150 miles from the Alaska border, and leaches untreated acidic water into the salmon-rich transboundary Stikine watershed.'b'Alongside big events like the Mount Polley disaster is the slow leach of toxins into Alaska waters. The Tulsequah Chief mine, built in the 1950s near the confluence of the Tulsequah River and the transboundary Taku River \xe2\x80\x94 and just over the border \xe2\x80\x94 has been polluting the Tulsequah for decades. Over the past 15 years there have been numerous 'b'remediation and pollution abatement orders'b' from the government of British Columbia, to no good effect.'b'The government again 'b'inspected'b' the Tulsequah Chief mine late last year, and 'b'found'b' numerous violations, including continued acid mine drainage flowing into the Tulsequah. Chieftain Metals, the mine\xe2\x80\x99s owner, has said it cannot stop the pollution unless it starts up production to gain needed revenue. British Columbia granted the company the permits. And so the game continues.'b'Except that now people are starting to pay attention. In late November, perhaps to dispel growing unease among Alaskans, Premier Clark signed a 'b'memorandum'b' of understanding with Alaska that would supposedly increase the state\xe2\x80\x99s role in reviewing mines. It\xe2\x80\x99s a charming document, but ultimately toothless: Language in the memorandum contains no legally binding obligations.'b'If we have learned one thing from depleted salmon runs in places like Norway, Iceland, Scotland, New England and Canada, it\xe2\x80\x99s that the waters and the forests nurturing these salmon cannot be destroyed without consequence. Secretary Kerry and the State Department need to take a stand on the part of Alaskans, Americans and some of the last wild rivers on earth, and request that the International Joint Commission act on this issue.'b'Soon my skipper will be back from Reno with a new knee, and I will fish with him, and perhaps his son. We will go out with our flashers and orange gloves and sharpened hooks and hunt salmon, tricking them onto dry land, as people here have done for thousands of years before us. And should be able to do for thousands more.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'WHEN we talk about diversity, or the lack thereof, we refer to it as \xe2\x80\x9ca problem.\xe2\x80\x9d This or that industry, organization or group has a gender problem or a race problem or some other kind of diversity-related problem. We identify the problem and discuss it, exhaustively, often contentiously, because the problem is significant, pervasive, and for those of us who are most affected, the problem is personal.'b'Another year, another set of Oscar nominations. For the second year in a row, no 'b'black actors have been nominated'b'. This profound absence is compounded by the 'b'Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences'b'\xe2\x80\x99 robust history of overlooking the work of actors, writers, directors and other film professionals who are people of color.'b'Hollywood has a race problem. Hollywood has always had a race problem. The movie industry continues to ignore audiences of color, to its own detriment, given the box office success of movies that do feature diverse casts. It continues to ignore the simple fact that people of color want to see their lives reflected in the movies they watch. Representation is not a lot to ask.'b'I love movies unabashedly. I always have. The cinematic spectacle grabs hold of me every time. Han Solo frozen in carbonite and Princess Leia choking Jabba the Hutt with the chain binding her to him.

There is electricity running through my body. When I saw \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hunger Games\xe2\x80\x9d I wanted to jump up and shout because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t contain the emotion I was feeling. During \xe2\x80\x9cWhiplash\xe2\x80\x9d I was speechless. Nostalgia and then sorrow overwhelmed me when I watched \xe2\x80\x9cThe Best Man Holiday'b',\xe2\x80\x9d'b' not once but three times. I am awed by what it takes to make a movie, so many people and practices that have to come together. Movies, the best and worst of them, offer me indelible memories and so much pleasure. They offer escape. They are an art form to which I, as a writer, aspire.'b'That aspiration is thwarted, though, because movies don\xe2\x80\x99t often feature people who look like me. I am not interested in writing movies about a sylph looking for love, living in New York in an improbably large apartment with a lot of natural light who never seems to spend much time at an actual job. I am not interested in writing movies about a white man who is on some kind of journey to find himself or avenge a wrong, whether in Brooklyn or the wilds of Montana and South Dakota. That there seems to be no place for people who look like me in movie making doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep me from writing or working, but I am constantly aware of the iron ceiling above me.'b'As of 2012, 'b'94 percent of academy voters'b' were white and 77 percent of those voters were men. The demographics of who makes movies, writes movies, edits movies, produces movies and stars in movies are equally stark. According to a 2014 report by the University of California, Los Angeles, on diversity in Hollywood, only 10.5 percent of lead actors in movies from 2011 were people of color and only 7.6 percent of movies from that same year were written by people of color.'b'When this year\xe2\x80\x99s Oscar nominations were released, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised. I was tired. I was, despite my fatigue, disappointed to see Ryan Coogler overlooked as best director and Michael B. Jordan overlooked for best actor for their work in \xe2\x80\x9cCreed.\xe2\x80\x9d I was frustrated that even if these men had been nominated, the Oscar nominations would still have been unbearably white.'b'Yet again, people of color were told, both implicitly and explicitly, that our stories and ways of seeing the world are not as valuable. We were told we should be satisfied with the scraps of recognition received in years past.'b'There is, perhaps, some hope. A little more than a week after the all-white slate of nominees was unveiled, the academy\xe2\x80\x99s governing board 'b'announced Friday'b' that it was going to make changes that might address the problem. It said it was committed to doubling the number of women and academy members of color by 2020. Members will have their voting status reviewed every 10 years, and that status could be revoked if a member hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been active in the industry within that decade. These are not immediate solutions and they may do little to improve matters, but at least the academy is acknowledging the problem. Meanwhile, we still must face Hollywood\xe2\x80\x99s race problem as it currently stands.'b'In the debate that has followed the 2016 Oscar nominations, there is the usual outrage, disgust and, in some parts, indifference or thinly veiled contempt. Robert Redford, from the Sundance festival, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not focused on that part. To me, it\xe2\x80\x99s about the work, and whatever reward comes from that, that\xe2\x80\x99s great. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think about it.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Redford, of course, already has his Oscar and he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t think about \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x9d because he has the luxury of not needing to.'b'Charlotte Rampling, who is nominated for a best actress Oscar this year, 'b'suggested'b' that all this talk of Hollywood and diversity is racist against white people. \xe2\x80\x9cBut do we have to take from this that there should be lots of minorities everywhere?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked. Let that sit for a minute. Hear what she is saying.'b'Michael Caine also had some insight, asking black actors to be patient because, well, it took him a long time to win his first Oscar. He 'b'also noted: 'b' \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end you can\xe2\x80\x99t vote for an actor because he\xe2\x80\x99s black. You can\xe2\x80\x99t say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to vote for him, he\xe2\x80\x99s not very good, but he\xe2\x80\x99s black, I\xe2\x80\x99ll vote for him.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Caine trotted out that old canard that the desire for diversity is the desire for the elevation of mediocrity.'b'Here, we have three veterans of the industry who appear to be positioning their white skin as the norm, as what deserves merit before anyone else receives consideration, as a marker of people whose experiences should be represented.'b'In the aftermath of the nomination announcements, the filmmaker 'b'Spike Lee'b' and the actor Jada Pinkett Smith and her husband, 'b'Will Smith,'b' have all stated that they plan not to attend the awards ceremony next month in protest.'b'The thing about a boycott is that there needs to be something at stake. I am not entirely clear what\xe2\x80\x99s at stake if we skip the Oscars. The root of the problem is not the academy, which selects the Oscar nominees, though certainly we should turn our critical eye to those voters who seem to favor white filmmakers and who tend to reward only a kind of \xe2\x80\x9cdiverse\xe2\x80\x9d movie that centers struggle as the mainstay in the black experience. They are just one part of a much larger, wholly diseased, industry.'b'The root of the problem is that there just isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough filmmaking by people of color. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough work in the pipeline. And not only are black actors and filmmakers overlooked by the academy, so are artists of other races and ethnicities. As often as we have conversations about this 'b'problem,'b' the conversation remains desperately narrow. There are a great many of us demanding a rightful place in the filmmaking world while the burden of keeping \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d conversations alive, and the burden of providing solutions, also falls to us.'b'Actors and filmmakers of color can and should take the stands they choose, but white people in the movie industry need to step up and spend less time complacently reveling in their privilege. White actors and filmmakers need to do more than offer a few thoughtful words in interviews. They need to unequivocally acknowledge the very real diversity problems that continue to go unsolved. They, too, need to stay home from the Oscars. They need to turn down projects that are monochromatic both in front of and behind the camera. They need to take on this problem as their own.'b'If we\xe2\x80\x99re going to boycott the Oscars, we also need to boycott the movie studios determined to ignore the box office success of movies featuring people of color. We need to boycott the people who are so reluctant to produce movies made by people of color. We need to boycott this system that refuses to acknowledge life beyond the white experience as rule and not exception. As a movie lover, I take no pleasure in the prospect of staking out such a hard line so that people of color might be heard and ultimately represented on the silver screen, but Hollywood has left us with little choice.'b'WHO among us hasn\xe2\x80\x99t wanted to let go of anxiety or forget about fear? Phobias, panic attacks and disorders like post-traumatic stress are extremely common: 29 percent of American adults will suffer from anxiety at some point in their lives.'b'Sitting at the heart of much anxiety and fear is emotional memory \xe2\x80\x94 all the associations that you have between various stimuli and experiences and your emotional response to them. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s the fear of being embarrassed while talking to strangers (typical of social phobia) or the dread of being attacked while walking down a dark street after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been assaulted (a symptom of PTSD), you have learned that a previously harmless situation predicts something dangerous.'b'It has been an article of faith in neuroscience and psychiatry that, once formed, emotional memories are permanent. Afraid of heights or spiders? The best we could do was to get you to tolerate them, but we could never really rid you of your initial fear. Or so the thinking has gone.'b'The current standard of treatment for such phobias revolves around exposure therapy. This involves repeatedly presenting the feared object or frightening memory in a safe setting, so that the patient acquires a new safe memory that resides in his brain alongside the bad memory. As long as the new memory has the upper hand, his fear is suppressed. But if he is re-traumatized or re-exposed with sufficient intensity to the original experience, his old fear will awaken with a vengeance.'b'This is one of the limitations of exposure therapy, along with the fact that it generally works in only about half of the PTSD patients who try it. Many also find it upsetting or intolerable to relive memories of assaults and other traumatizing experiences.'b'We urgently need more effective treatments for anxiety disorders. What if we could do better than creating a new safe memory \xe2\x80\x94 and actually get rid of emotions attached to the old bad one?'b'New research suggests that it may be possible not just to change certain types of emotional memories, but even to erase them. We\xe2\x80\x99ve learned that memories are uniquely vulnerable to alteration at two points: when we first lay them down, and later, when we retrieve them.'b'Merel Kindt, a professor of psychology at the University of Amsterdam, and her colleagues have seemingly erased the emotional fear response in healthy people with arachnophobia. For 'b'a study published last month in the journal Biological Psychiatry'b', she compared three groups made up of 45 subjects in total. One group was exposed to a tarantula in a glass jar for two minutes, and then given a beta-blocker called propranolol that is commonly prescribed to patients for performance anxiety; one was exposed to the tarantula and given a placebo; and one was just given propranolol without being shown the spider, to rule out the possibility that propranolol by itself could decrease spider fear.'b'Dr. Kindt assessed the subjects\xe2\x80\x99 anxiety when they were shown the spider the first time, then again three months later, and finally after a year. What she found was remarkable. Those who got the propranolol alone and those who got the placebo had no improvement in their anxiety. But the arachnophobes who were exposed to the spider and given the drug were able to touch the tarantula within days and, by three months, many felt comfortable holding the spider with their bare hands. Their fear did not return even at the end of one year.'b'How does this work? Well, propranolol blocks the effects of norepinephrine in the brain. This chemical, which is similar to adrenaline, enhances learning, so blocking it disrupts the way a memory is put back in storage after it is retrieved \xe2\x80\x94 a process called reconsolidation.'b'Arachnophobes have an emotional memory that involves an association between spiders and a dreaded outcome, like a spider bite. This \xe2\x80\x9cfear memory\xe2\x80\x9d is the source of their phobia \xe2\x80\x94 even if (as is often the case) it never actually happened. The basic idea is that when Dr. Kindt briefly exposed the subjects to the spider, she reactivated their fear, which made the fear memory susceptible to the influence of propranolol.'b'Reconsolidation is a bit like pulling up a file on your computer, rewriting the same material in a bigger, bolder font and saving it again. Disrupting reconsolidation with propranolol or another drug is akin to retrieving this document, erasing some or all of the text and then writing something new in its place.'b'Dr. Kindt is not the first to demonstrate that disrupting reconsolidation can weaken or erase emotional memories. Several studies of rats done in 2000 showed that a drug called anisomycin, which blocks the synthesis of proteins in the brain, could reduce fear associations. In one, researchers taught rats to fear a sound by pairing it with a shock. After the animals were fear-conditioned, they were presented with the sound and then immediately given the drug. When the animals were exposed to the sound again, they no longer appeared afraid; they had forgotten their original fear.'b'Curiously, there is a very narrow time window after retrieving a fear memory when you can disrupt that memory \xe2\x80\x94 hours, in the animal studies \xe2\x80\x94 before it closes and the drug has no effect.'b'These studies suggest that someday, a single dose of a drug, combined with exposure to your fear at the right moment, could free you of that fear forever. But there\xe2\x80\x99s a flip side to this story about how to undo emotional learning: how to strengthen it. We can do that with drugs as well, and may have been doing it for some time.'b'ANXIETY enhances emotional memory. We all know that \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s why you can easily forget where you put your wallet, but will never forget being attacked. This is the case because anxiety leads to the release of norepinephrine in the brain, which, again, strengthens emotional learning. It is also why we should think twice about casually prescribing stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall for young people who really don\xe2\x80\x99t need them. Stimulants also cause the release of norepinephrine and may enhance fear learning. So it is possible that taking stimulants could increase one\xe2\x80\x99s risk of developing PTSD when exposed to trauma.'b'Indeed, a study that will be published next month found that the escalating use of stimulants by the military in active duty soldiers, including those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, was strongly correlated with an increase in the rates of PTSD, even when controlling for other factors, like the rate of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The study examined the use of prescription stimulants, like Ritalin and Adderall, and the rates of PTSD in nearly 26,000 military service members between 2001 and 2008, and found that the incidence of PTSD increased along with the prescriptions.'b'By blocking the effect of norepinephrine and disrupting memory reconsolidation, we could perhaps reverse this process. The clear implication of these studies is that emotional memory is not permanent after all.'b'Before you rush off into a panic about the dystopian possibility of mind control or memory deletion, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to recognize that the procedure in Dr. Kindt\xe2\x80\x99s study only weakened the subjects\xe2\x80\x99 fear memory and avoidant behavior. Although the procedure is able to alter or perhaps delete the fear memory (something exposure therapy cannot do), it does nothing to the factual, or biographical, memory, which remains intact.'b'This is not \xe2\x80\x9cEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\xe2\x80\x9d the movie in which a dysfunctional couple decides to erase their memories of each other and start their lives all over again. To the contrary, you still remember your biography, but your fear would be stripped of its force. The subjects knew perfectly well after the study that they previously feared spiders and that they now \xe2\x80\x94 strangely \xe2\x80\x94 felt little to no anxiety around them.'b'If this new approach is effective in other anxiety disorders, like PTSD, you would expect someone who was assaulted in his home to remember the attack perfectly well, but no longer feel afraid of being at home. What\xe2\x80\x99s so bad about that?'b'It would certainly be superior to exposure therapy, which is far from a permanent fix. Once, while on vacation in Costa Rica, I was standing next to a young man on a zip line platform in a rain forest when he began to hyperventilate. I learned that he had a fear of heights and had had exposure treatment a year before, which he felt had fixed the problem. But now, his old fear was triggered and he was having a full-blown panic attack. I suppose he was lucky to be stuck with a psychiatrist in the jungle; I talked him down the ladder to the ground.'b'How effective this new memory-disrupting approach will be in treating more serious anxiety disorders like PTSD or panic is unclear. A few preliminary studies using propranolol in PTSD showed mixed results. Some found no effect, but a 2015 review of PTSD treatment studies published in Biological Psychology found that propranolol administered with six brief trauma reactivation sessions significantly improved PTSD symptoms compared with a placebo.'b'Study results may well change with the development of better methods for administering propranolol or new drugs that are more effective in disrupting memory reconsolidation. Marieke S. Tollenaar, a psychologist at Leiden University in the Netherlands who has studied the effects of propranolol on memory, told me that the \xe2\x80\x9cfinal test\xe2\x80\x9d would be to \xe2\x80\x9cexamine in real life whether propranolol in addition to standard exposure treatment procedures would be beneficial. Little has been done there yet; most work is still done experimentally in the lab.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some may view any attempt to tamper with human memory as disturbing because it seems at odds with what we ought to do as a culture with the darker aspects of our history: Never alter the facts, even if we have divergent interpretations of them. And it is critical not to destroy places where crimes of humanity and collective trauma took place, like the concentration camps, so we never forget what we have done and remain capable of doing. Fair enough. But I see no reason not to help frightened individuals soften their painful emotional memories.'b'Some may also argue that it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake to tinker with our fear responses because they\xe2\x80\x99re natural \xe2\x80\x94 they evolved this way for a reason. Like most other animals, we come hard-wired with a flight or fight response along with its associated anxiety and fear. Without this warning system to protect us from predators and other dangers, we\xe2\x80\x99d have been dinner long ago on the savanna.'b'But what was once adaptive millions of years ago isn\xe2\x80\x99t always so helpful today. People who suffer panic attacks hyperventilate and have an intense desire to flee in situations where there is rarely actual danger. It turns out that panic disorder is associated with an increased sensitivity to carbon dioxide in the brain. If you lived in a cave with a clan of hominid fire-dwellers, you\xe2\x80\x99d have been one of the first to get out when the oxygen supply was dwindling.'b'Curiously, that might help explain why some people have panic attacks that wake them at night. These patients don\xe2\x80\x99t panic during so-called REM sleep, when dreams occur, but during non-REM sleep, when they are deeply relaxed, when breathing slows, and the levels of carbon dioxide rise, generating a false suffocation alarm.'b'Evolutionary design has left us a few million years out of date; we are hard-wired for a Paleolithic world, but have to live in a modern one. The irrational fear of anxiety disorders was once probably useful and lifesaving. No longer.'b'But maybe that modern world can help. I see nothing wrong with doing all we can to rid ourselves of pathological anxiety, including using drugs to alter our painful emotional memories.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 Until recently, Donald J. Trump was best known in Britain for \xe2\x80\x9cThe Apprentice\xe2\x80\x9d television series, the Miss Universe contest and a controversial 'b'golf course'b' development in Scotland. And most Britons would probably have viewed his decision to enter the presidential race with no more than mild envy: Why can\xe2\x80\x99t British elections be as much fun as American ones?'b'Thanks, however, to his incendiary comments about immigrants and Muslims, Mr. Trump has moved from being a buffoonish figure on the margins of British consciousness to the center of political debate. After Mr. Trump said that he, if president, would stop Muslims entering the United States, more than half a million people signed a 'b'parliamentary petition'b', thus requiring a debate in Parliament on whether to bar 'b'him'b' entry to Britain. (The debate, which was held this past week in a committee, generated plenty of indignation but had no issue because the power to refuse Mr. Trump admittance is held not by Parliament but by the home secretary.)'b'Mr. Trump also drew condemnation from leading British politicians, newspapers, the Metropolitan Police and the mayor of London. Even the leader of the UK Independence Party, which campaigns on a strong anti-immigration platform, said Mr. Trump had \xe2\x80\x9cgone too far.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Mr. Trump speaks of barring Muslims from entering the United States, I hear an echo of a British politician from another age, one who is largely forgotten here but whose views on race and immigration were as polarizing in their time as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s are now. Enoch Powell was a politician whose career spanned most of the postwar period, first as a Conservative and later as an Ulster Unionist. He had grave reservations about mass immigration and frequently spoke in apocalyptic language about its consequences.'b'Mr. Powell was hardly an obvious demagogue. The Labour politician Denis Healey once compared him to the Athenian statesman Demosthenes. He was a classical scholar and gifted linguist, and his speeches were renowned for their erudition. Examples from Roman history are not part of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rhetorical repertoire.'b'In 1960, Mr. Powell was appointed minister of health in the Conservative government. In this post, he encouraged many immigrants from the Commonwealth to come to work in the understaffed National Health Service \xe2\x80\x94 which adds a layer of irony to the fact that his most enduring fame, or infamy, is for an epoch-defining speech he gave 'b'against'b' immigration.'b'By 1968, he had become the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s chief spokesman on defense \xe2\x80\x94 if largely by virtue of the fact that, as a talented maverick, he was regarded by the Conservatives\xe2\x80\x99 new leader, Edward Heath, as too dangerous to leave out. Speaking in Birmingham, England\xe2\x80\x99s second largest city and one already changed by extensive immigration, 'b'Mr. Powell argued'b' that \xe2\x80\x9cwe must be mad, literally mad, as a nation to be permitting the annual inflow of some 50,000 dependents.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This policy, he warned, \xe2\x80\x9cis like watching a nation busily engaged in heaping up its own funeral pyre.\xe2\x80\x9d In the most often quoted line \xe2\x80\x94 an allusion to the poet Virgil \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Powell said, \xe2\x80\x9cas I look ahead, I am filled with foreboding; like the Roman, I seem to see \xe2\x80\x98the River Tiber foaming with much blood.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Times of London called it \xe2\x80\x9can evil speech,\xe2\x80\x9d and the first direct appeal to \xe2\x80\x9cracial hatred\xe2\x80\x9d made by a senior British politician. Mr. Powell was summarily dismissed from his post by Mr. Heath.'b'Yet his lurid warning about the dangers of mass immigration resonated with many Britons. He received tens of thousands of letters of support for what became known as the \xe2\x80\x9crivers of blood\xe2\x80\x9d speech. Three days later, as a Labour government bill against racial discrimination was debated in Parliament, 1,000 dock workers marched from London\xe2\x80\x99s East End to protest the \xe2\x80\x9cvictimization\xe2\x80\x9d of Mr. Powell.'b'There are parallels between the way Mr. Powell gave voice to white working-class anxiety and Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s primary campaigning. And like Mr. Trump, Mr. Powell discovered a ready audience: A Gallup poll a few weeks later found that 74 percent of those surveyed agreed with what Mr. Powell had said. For immigrants like my father, who arrived in Britain from Pakistan in the early 1960s, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Mr. Powell\xe2\x80\x99s words that were frightening so much as that so many seemed to agree with them.'b'My father settled in Luton, an industrial town about 30 miles north of London that had a significant immigrant population. He worked on the assembly line at the Vauxhall car factory, the largest employer in the area. By the time my mother and siblings joined my father, in 1974, Mr. Powell was already a marginal figure in national politics. But his race-based views had been taken up by far-right groups like the National Front.'b'The National Front\xe2\x80\x99s thuggish supporters were a visible, violent presence on the streets during my childhood. Mr. Powell\xe2\x80\x99s speech also lent its anti-immigrant message a veneer of mainstream acceptability. The party\xe2\x80\x99s program was crude \xe2\x80\x94 a ban on nonwhite immigration and repatriation for nonwhites \xe2\x80\x94 but, for a time, worryingly effective: In the 1979 general election, the National Front had more than 300 parliamentary candidates and won nearly 200,000 votes.'b'Growing up in the shadow of the \xe2\x80\x9cN.F.\xe2\x80\x9d and knowing that there were hundreds of thousands of Britons who wished to deport people like me induced both a profound anxiety and a deep conviction that I would never be fully accepted as British.'b'In recent years, the target of nativist anxiety about otherness in Britain has shifted from black to Muslim. From my background in Luton, I always looked to the United States as a place where almost everyone was \xe2\x80\x9cother,\xe2\x80\x9d from somewhere else; I imagined it as a nation that offered a welcome to all, regardless of color or creed.'b'That faith has been sorely tested by Mr. Trump. Like Mr. Powell, he demonstrates the appeal of a charismatic leader who presents himself as a principled truth-teller, the only man brave enough to break with the establishment consensus on immigration. As Mr. Powell did, Mr. Trump connects with voters \xe2\x80\x94 especially among the economically insecure white working class \xe2\x80\x94 who feel they\xe2\x80\x99re being lied to by the political elite.'b'The difference between them is that the \xe2\x80\x9crivers of blood\xe2\x80\x9d speech effectively ended Mr. Powell\xe2\x80\x99s political career (he never again held high office, though he remained a member of Parliament until 1987), whereas Mr. Trump has been rewarded so far for his harsh words. Mr. Trump has drawn some criticism from other Republicans, but he is certainly not the pariah that Mr. Powell became.'b'Mr. Trump, like Mr. Powell before him, speaks for those convulsed by fear. In his 1968 speech, Mr. Powell quoted a constituent who dreaded a future when \xe2\x80\x9cthe black man will have the whip hand over the white man.\xe2\x80\x9d That paranoia \xe2\x80\x94 an ugly delusion that inverts the actual history of slavery \xe2\x80\x94 was unfounded. Yet what is striking today is that though Mr. Powell was cast into the wilderness for his views, arguably his warning about the challenges to social cohesion from immigration 'b'was'b' prescient.'b'Thankfully, the rivers of blood he foresaw never flowed. But nearly five decades later, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s long experience of race riots and domestic terrorist attacks suggests that the countervailing doctrine of multiculturalism has not made for a land of milk and honey either.'b'The growth of a radical Islamic identity among some young Muslims has led to legitimate fears about the possible failure of British society to fully integrate its immigrants. Here, the populist UK Independence Party has inherited the mantle of Powellism. And in the United States, particularly in the wake of December\xe2\x80\x99s San Bernardino shootings, the target of fear and loathing has also been Muslims.'b'The experience of 'b'Rose Hamid'b', who was ejected from a Trump rally while silently protesting by wearing a T-shirt that read \xe2\x80\x9cSalam I come in peace,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d demonstrated the violence of such emotions. Mr. Trump is exquisitely attuned to popular anxieties and highly talented at exploiting them.'b'Mr. Trump has not even won his party\xe2\x80\x99s nomination, yet his agenda already seems to have influence. There have been several reports of British Muslims being denied the right to fly to the United States, seemingly only because of their religion. As someone who has long cherished the idea of America, I am distressed to see how quickly fear can travel and mutate from hot words to dangerous deeds.'b'The success of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign is very disturbing, but the retaliatory effort to bar him from Britain is a move that seems as petty \xe2\x80\x94 and constitutionally suspect \xe2\x80\x94 as anything advocated by the mogul himself. Even if nearly 600,000 people signed the parliamentary petition to keep Mr. Trump out, a recent survey here also found that 29 percent of respondents 'b'would favor a similar ban'b' on Muslims entering Britain. So rather than a futile petition, it would be wiser to play the ball rather than the man: to dispute the actual issues rather than dismiss him as primitive and dumb.'b'In Britain, Powellism was eventually defeated as a political movement in part because politicians across the divide united against his views, in part because his dire predictions proved exaggerated and, not least, because people of good will mobilized to stop groups like the National Front from intimidating immigrant neighborhoods and winning elections. But Mr. Powell\xe2\x80\x99s legacy was long and bitter \xe2\x80\x94 a lesson for both Britain and America that the price of not confronting the fears that fuel this antipathy could be severe: Whether or not Donald Trump wins his immediate political battle, he may, like Enoch Powell, win the war of ideas.'b'Dhaka, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94 EVERY winter, I return here to my hometown, and every year, I feel a little shabbier. This time, when I was meeting a few old school friends at a neighborhood cafe, I finally understood why: the blow-dry. Everyone else had one. Everyone else had gone to the beauty parlor, and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'When I was growing up, there were just three beauty salons in the capital: Lily\xe2\x80\x99s, Lisa\xe2\x80\x99s and Neelo\xe2\x80\x99s. Lily\xe2\x80\x99s, run by a Chinese family, was built above a garage. I got my first perm there, a chemical baptism that left me smelling like a tire factory for months.'b'Then there was Lisa, a woman of enormous girth who gave one of my aunts a particular side parting that remained in place throughout most of the 1980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s. I never went to Neelo\xe2\x80\x99s because, being on the upscale side of town, it was too intimidating. But one of my friends told me that her mother never washed her hair in the winter; she just went to Neelo\xe2\x80\x99s every other day between November and March.'b'Beauty parlors have now proliferated throughout the city. They have names like Dazzle and Hairobics. You can get anything from a haircut to a full bridal package, which includes waxing, makeup and a hairdo.'b'I see the appeal of the parlor \xe2\x80\x94 a reasonably affordable way to transform oneself into someone who appears to know what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing with a hairbrush and a bottle of nail polish \xe2\x80\x94 though, to me, it has always seemed like a chamber of medieval torture. Yet the anthropologist in me is intrigued in spite of my discomfort.'b'There is the issue of class, first and foremost. The women who work in the salons are from minority communities from the west and south of the capital. They themselves wear no makeup, their hair is never blow-dried, and they shuffle around the parlor looking defeated. The proprietors are paternalistic: In return for putting up these women in small, shared rooms above the premises, the owners expect unquestioning loyalty and long hours.'b'As for the clientele, the sleek, airbrushed-look hair that is now ubiquitous sets a certain class of women apart. You can spot the difference between a wealthy woman and a merely middle-class one not just by the neighborhood she lives in and the clothes she wears, but also by the permanent sheen and movement of her hair.'b'The beauty parlor is also where women are forced to face the color prejudice that is widespread in Bangladesh. Eavesdrop on a conversation and you\xe2\x80\x99re very likely to hear someone complaining about the color of her skin. She might then be offered a range of skin-lightening treatments. Once, a parlor girl nodded toward the customer next to me who was being embalmed by some kind of noxious white cream, and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHer shoulders are too dark.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Finally, there is what I call \xe2\x80\x9cextreme grooming\xe2\x80\x9d: a whole stack of procedures that take practically all day, including a mask of makeup to finish with, just for a night out. Once reserved for brides, these packages are now being purchased by anyone who wants to look perfect for the evening.'b'The result is that the fully polished look has become the norm, raising the standard for everyone else and normalizing what should really be a once-in-a-lifetime rite of passage.'b'The relentless rise of personal grooming is not unique to Dhaka. As the rise of blow-dry bars in major cities worldwide and the increasing popularity of on-demand beauty apps suggest, the pressure to look immaculately chic and coifed has dramatically increased in the age of Instagram. The idea that beauty should be accessible to all is evolving to mean that more and more women aspire to ever higher standards.'b'There may be some who will breezily declare the rise of the blow-dry an innocent, possibly even empowering, trend. But it rubs me the wrong way. The women of my mother\xe2\x80\x99s generation were revolutionaries; they called each other comrade and marched on the streets demanding independence for Bangladesh. And that feminist movement is one of the major reasons that today Bangladesh is still, against all the odds, posting impressive statistics on everything from girls\xe2\x80\x99 enrollment in primary school to maternal health.'b'So I hold on to my feeling that there is no such thing as an innocent blow-dry. Yet there are subtle complexities to this social trend. I have a friend who is, by her own admission, a compulsive parlorgoer. If she\xe2\x80\x99s been abroad, the first thing she does when she gets home is visit the parlor. She brings gifts for the salon girls, and they shower her with attention.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to the keratin blow-dry,\xe2\x80\x9d she tells me. But it\xe2\x80\x99s more than that: She likes being greeted by women who have watched her grow from an awkward teenager with kinky hair into an adult; she likes that they know exactly how her hair should be done; and she likes the expert, almost loving way they tend to her body. It\xe2\x80\x99s not quite a friendship, but there\xe2\x80\x99s an intimacy beyond the regular client-server relationship.'b'After a week in Dhaka, I succumb and pay a visit to my local parlor, Bliss. As I enter, I\xe2\x80\x99m hit by the smell of nail polish remover. I hover around the entrance for a while, but no one notices me. There is a row of chairs in front where women are getting their hair done, and another section toward the back for manicures and waxing. I spot an older woman who looks like she\xe2\x80\x99s in charge, and ask for a leg wax.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m shown into a narrow booth and given a petticoat and instructed to fasten it under my arms. After a few minutes, a skinny young woman approaches with an implement that looks like a butter knife, a torn-off strip of towel and a bowl of wax, which is actually not wax at all but a mixture of melted sugar and lemon juice. She grabs my calf and smears the goo from knee to ankle. It\xe2\x80\x99s very hot. She presses the rag to the mix and pulls it off in one sharp movement. I wince.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt only hurts because your hairs are so long,\xe2\x80\x9d she complains. The shame.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour skin is scaly,\xe2\x80\x9d she goes on, mercilessly. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you moisturize?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When she\xe2\x80\x99s done with my calves she\xe2\x80\x99ll tell me I have fat knees. I pick up other snatches of conversation and note the easy way the parlor girls and their clients tease one another, and I\xe2\x80\x99m secretly happy. Although this young woman fills me with self-loathing, I find I\xe2\x80\x99m glad she feels free to insult me.'b'The parlor laughter is genuine, at least in the moment, but it\xe2\x80\x99s all carefully orchestrated. There\xe2\x80\x99s only so far she will go, and there are the scary older aunties who will tolerate no comedy at all. The beauty parlor is a place where the rules are reinscribed, yet also upended. Peppered through the class-based rituals are moments when two people from disparate spheres of life might chafe against each other, and the person with less power may triumph, if just momentarily.'b'A woman in a neighboring booth is getting a bikini wax. I hear her giving the parlor girl strict instructions. There\xe2\x80\x99s a pause, and then sound of the wax being ripped off. The woman cries out in pain.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want me to do, rub it better?\xe2\x80\x9d the parlor girl asks. They both explode in laughter.'b'ISTANBUL \xe2\x80\x94 Entire towns and districts are under siege. Tanks ram through narrow alleys closed off by barricades and trenches. Residents are trapped indoors for weeks because of curfews. Those who venture outside risk sniper fire. Their bodies lie on the streets for days before they can be collected. Bullets fly in through windows and buildings collapse under shelling, killing those seeking shelter at home.'b'This is not Syria. This is 'b'Turkey'b', the European Union candidate country once hailed as a champion of the Arab Spring. The conflict that restarted here after the breakdown of talks between the Turkish state and the Kurdistan Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Party, or P.K.K., last summer has turned into a devastating war in Kurdish towns and cities.'b'One of the most affected places is the city of Diyarbakir\xe2\x80\x99s historic Sur district, where I was mayor from 2004 to 2014. Sur has been under 24-hour curfew since the beginning of December. Many of its neighborhoods lie in ruins. Its historic buildings are damaged, once busy shops are shut, hospitals lack staff, and schools are closed. Tens of thousands of people have fled.'b'Sur\xe2\x80\x99s walls surround an ancient city that has been inhabited for millenniums. Its narrow streets, spacious courtyards and elegant stone structures are reminders of a rich multicultural legacy \xe2\x80\x94 a legacy that has survived, albeit in an impoverished state, a century of conflict. Small but increasingly visible communities of Armenians, Assyrians, Chaldeans, Yazidis and other minorities live alongside adherents of diverse interpretations of Islam in what is now a predominantly Sunni Kurdish town.'b'Over the past decade, our municipality worked hard to revive and preserve this heritage. We oversaw the restoration of many historic buildings, including mosques and churches. The reopening of the Surp Giragos Armenian Church, which is now the largest Armenian church in the Middle East, after nearly a century in ruins has 'b'encouraged'b' \xe2\x80\x9chidden\xe2\x80\x9d survivors in Turkey of the 1915 genocide to rediscover and embrace their heritage. Efforts to restore the old synagogue in memory of Sur\xe2\x80\x99s once vibrant Jewish community were underway before the eruption of violence last summer.'b'In 2012, Sur\xe2\x80\x99s community leaders established an interfaith dialogue group bringing together representatives of the region\xe2\x80\x99s different religions, cultures and civil society groups. Known as the Council of Forty, it has played a crucial role in keeping sectarian violence from reaching our city. Thanks to its efforts, Sur came to symbolize the vision of peaceful coexistence in a region plagued by intolerance.'b'It causes me immense grief to see that pluralism fall apart along with Sur\xe2\x80\x99s buildings. Sectarianism is destroying Syria before our very eyes. To avoid the same fate in Turkey, the Council of Forty has called on the government to lift the curfews, and asked all sides to end hostilities and return to peace talks within the framework of parliamentary democracy.'b'President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said recently that military operations in the besieged Kurdish towns would continue until they were \xe2\x80\x9ccleansed\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9dterrorists.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou will be annihilated in those houses, those buildings, those ditches which you have dug,\xe2\x80\x9d he threatened. But what peace can be built through destruction? Decades of military policies against the Kurds have shown only that violence begets more violence.'b'Many residents of these towns are poor families who were forced to flee the countryside when the conflict between the Kurds and the Turkish state was at its peak in the 1990s. Those who are digging trenches and declaring \xe2\x80\x9cself-rule\xe2\x80\x9d in Sur and other cities and towns of southeastern Turkey today are mostly Kurdish youths in their teens and 20s who were born into that earlier era of violence, poverty and displacement, and grew up in radicalized ghettos.'b'Now a new generation will grow up with the trauma of killing, destruction and forced migration. Where will they go? What will become of them? And how will an angrier generation of Kurds and Turks find common ground? The truth is that my generation may be the last to reach a peaceful settlement through dialogue.'b'Dialogue is possible when those in power want it. Last spring, the two sides were on the verge of a breakthrough after two and a half years of negotiations. The Kurds, when given a real and fair choice, have repeatedly picked politics over violence and opted for coexistence in a democratic Turkey, where their rights and identities are recognized, over separation. But as the destruction goes on, their faith in a political solution withers.'b'In 2007, Sur became the first municipality in Turkey to offer services in local languages, including Kurdish, Armenian and Assyrian, besides the official Turkish \xe2\x80\x94 a move that infuriated the authorities in Ankara, the capital, and led to my removal as mayor. In 2009, months after being re-elected with two-thirds of the vote, I was arrested on charges of separatism. (I was released five months later on health grounds and kept my role as mayor throughout my arrest.)'b'As I was rounded up along with hundreds of Kurdish activists and elected politicians, my teenage son left our house to join the P.K.K. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are wasting time with your politics and dialogue,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. I dedicated my life to trying to prove him wrong and bring him home in peace. I have been discouraged before, but never lost hope. Today, I struggle to keep that hope alive.'b'We all remember the \xe2\x80\x9cbad kids\xe2\x80\x9d from high school: the pregnant teen, the kid who was always getting into fights, the truant student, or the one who just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with the rest of us.'b'We take kids who can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to stay on track and write them off, dismissing them with summary labels. It\xe2\x80\x99s simpler that way \xe2\x80\x94 if we know what they are, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really have to think about why. So more often than not, the roots of a \xe2\x80\x9cbad kid\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d difficulties are left unexplored, as they would most likely force us to look at histories of abuse, neglect, abandonment, addiction or possibly even that huge unspoken problem that plagues our public education system: intractable, generational poverty.'b'This Op-Doc video profiles one of those kids, a talented art student named Summer Jordan, who attends Black Rock High School in the Mojave Desert town of Yucca Valley, Calif. An alternative public school for at-risk students, Black Rock is cautiously regarded, even in its own community, as the school where the \xe2\x80\x9cbad kids\xe2\x80\x9d go, despite consistently high graduation rates. But at Black Rock High, the staff does not judge at-risk students as failures; rather, they see them as fragile youths who are more than likely dealing with problems outside of school that would daunt most adults. And as you\xe2\x80\x99ll see in this Op-Doc, the students and their problems are much more complicated than they may initially seem.'b'Luckily for kids like Summer, the school\xe2\x80\x99s staff is not afraid of asking what impediments might be keeping its students from doing their best in school. The approach seems obvious, but it\xe2\x80\x99s quite revolutionary: It is the simple understanding that for a student who\xe2\x80\x99s hungry, or not sure where he is going to sleep that night, or afraid of someone she lives with, learning is impossible, no matter how innovative the curriculum or teaching methods.'b'A school may not be able to fix a student\xe2\x80\x99s home life, but it can offer students acknowledgment, advice, life skills, and most important, empathy. In Summer\xe2\x80\x99s case, it at least gave her a choice.'b''b'This video is part of a series produced by independent filmmakers who have received support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute.'b''b'Pella, Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThere he is!\xe2\x80\x9d I said after spotting the crowd near the fountain, a couple of dozen media minions, holding cameras and microphones, all waving for attention. Jeb Bush was in my Iowa neighborhood, and I needed an interview. That\xe2\x80\x99s what I do. I\xe2\x80\x99m a small town radio news guy.'b'I report on everything \xe2\x80\x94 community events, City Council meetings, car wrecks, the occasional drug bust, murder or tornado. When I was asked if I was worried about satellite radio taking away our listeners, I told them I\xe2\x80\x99d worry as soon as I saw Howard Stern at a local City Council meeting.'b'Since 2007, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been covering the Iowa caucuses. Those weeks when our local news becomes your national news. We do our best to put the candidates through their paces.'b'And here I was, about to let my listeners down. In a few hours Mr. Bush was to give a speech to several hundred locals, and his staff had told me over the phone that they \xe2\x80\x9chope\xe2\x80\x9d I understand that he is \xe2\x80\x9cway too busy\xe2\x80\x9d for an interview.'b'Still, I elbowed my way through the crowd. Security looked me up and down, then ignored me. Must be my suspenders, I thought. I parted some branches, finding an opening in the crowd by the trunk of a tree, to see who was interviewing Mr. Bush.'b'It was Mr. Big himself \xe2\x80\x94 David Muir, the anchor for \xe2\x80\x9cWorld News Tonight\xe2\x80\x9d on ABC. I sighed. Of course Mr. Bush would deal with the big media first \xe2\x80\x94 for many candidates and their staff, that\xe2\x80\x99s all they know.'b'I saw a friend who works for a local newspaper. He grabbed my arm and whispered, \xe2\x80\x9cYou get Bush yet?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNope, he\xe2\x80\x99s too busy,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, perhaps too loudly. A lady holding a boom mike scowled at me, finger to her lips.'b'We watched Mr. Muir lead his interview, as dashing in person as he is on TV. Maybe more. Perfect hair. Teeth. A genetic miracle. His blue suit fit perfectly. Glancing around, I caught our reflections in a shop window. Thank God for radio and print, I thought.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure how many presidential candidates I\xe2\x80\x99ve interviewed over the years. Too many to count. Some of the candidates resonated with Iowans, others didn\xe2\x80\x99t. In 2008, Barack Obama and Mike Huckabee got some love; Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Some play the media like a violin, others are clueless. Some understand how crucial local coverage is, others don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'I remember back in 2012 when Sarah Palin was still considering running. She was in town making an appearance and her security waved me through. Later that evening during a pause in activities, I asked the security director why he let me approach. \xe2\x80\x9cThe suspenders,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd wrong side of 50.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 2008, Joe Biden was great. He made all of us small media guys and gals feel as if we\xe2\x80\x99d known him forever. Joe was never in a hurry. Never \xe2\x80\x9ctoo busy.\xe2\x80\x9d Hillary? \xe2\x80\x9cToo busy.\xe2\x80\x9d She occasionally dipped her toe into the waters of rural Iowa, but preferred our larger cities. (Yoo-hoo, Hillary! I\xe2\x80\x99m right here!)'b'Mitt Romney gave me a couple of interviews, but his staff wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t let him out of arm\xe2\x80\x99s reach, and I felt as if I was a quarterback with a mike in the middle of a football huddle.'b'In 2012 Rick Santorum was around so much, it was like he was a neighbor. He fit in just fine \xe2\x80\x94 sweater vest and all. In 2007, Chris Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut, moved into the state, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t help him. He looked too much like lots of city folk do: afraid he was going to step in a pile of cow poop.'b'At a summit on agriculture in Des Moines in 2015, when all the original candidates were in the race, Republicans seemed to know very little about agriculture. Mr. Bush, George Pataki and Rick Perry were somewhat conversant with agricultural issues. The rest appeared to think food magically appeared on grocery-store shelves. The national media, from what I could tell, were equally clueless. Every corner of this country is different. People in Montana might be concerned about the loss of glaciers in Montana. In California, the drought. In Louisiana, the oil industry. In Texas, border issues. In coastal New England, the fishing industry.'b'Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley had to Google the price of corn and beans \xe2\x80\x94 not a good thing to have to do in Iowa. Lindsey Graham knew the price of corn and beans, but not much else about Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s economy.'b'Years ago, I remember Mr. Obama made a lot of time for locals, and answered our questions. All of them. Why had Mr. Obama singled us out rather than someone with big names? \xe2\x80\x9cYou are the media who live here,\xe2\x80\x9d a staffer told me, \xe2\x80\x9cwho the community knows and trusts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In local media, most of us have worked hard to be respected in our communities. People know our personalities, our biases, and are interested in how the candidates interact with us. Sure, the big media asks great questions about the economy, foreign affairs, health care, you name it. But my questions might be a little different, like, what do you think about the low prices of corn and beans? What can be done about the deteriorating lock-and-dam system on the Mississippi River that stops us from getting the soybeans to China they so desperately want? I know what Iowans want asked because I\xe2\x80\x99m one of them.'b'Back at the Jeb Bush scene, he was being ushered to another event. I left my perch near the tree and followed. It felt as if Mr. Bush and his entourage had the whole production choreographed, and I was the only one who didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the dance steps.'b'I cut back between two parked cars and popped up in the path of Mr. Bush on the sidewalk. \xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBob, local radio,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. He nodded, and I went on. \xe2\x80\x9cOne failed corn or wheat crop and the American economy collapses. Is agriculture a national security issue?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Around us the media paused. Everyone searched for the camera angles they wanted. I sucked in my tummy and tried to stand up straight.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, yes, it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied slowly. But he had no specifics. It was a question, apparently, he\xe2\x80\x99d never been asked before. A staffer tapped his watch, pulling Mr. Bush away, and the rest of the media followed. I knew that I had gotten all I was going to get.'b'In October, when Hillary Clinton made a spectacle of the congressional Benghazi committee during a marathon interrogation that seemed designed to make a spectacle of her, she 'b'emerged stronger than ever'b'. Her 'b'polls numbers surged'b'.'b'That performance had come on the heels of a 'b'strong debate performance'b' the week before in the first Democratic presidential debate.'b'She had bolstered the image she wanted to project: strong, smart, capable and battle-tested.'b'But now, on the verge of Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic town hall in Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 the last time the candidates will face off before the caucuses in that state \xe2\x80\x94 and with Bernie Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s poll numbers climbing not only in Iowa, but also in New Hampshire, the Clinton campaign seems increasingly desperate and reckless.'b'I noticed the turn in the last debate as Clinton seemed to me to go too far in her attacks on Sanders, while simultaneously painting herself into a box that will be very hard to escape.'b'She wrapped herself in President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s legacy so tightly that she could hardly breathe, and then built an image of herself as a practical politician who could build on Obama\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments by taking small steps and negotiating tough deals.'b'But practicality and incrementalism, as reasonable as that strategy and persona may be, are simply no match for what animates the Sanders campaign \xe2\x80\x94 a kind of kinetic, even if sometimes overblown, idealism. His is a passionate exposition of liberalism \xe2\x80\x94 and yes, democratic socialism \xe2\x80\x94 in its most positive light.'b'But, let me be clear and unequivocal: I find his earnest philosophic positions to be clear and often laudable, but also somewhat quixotic. I think that he is promising far more than even he knows he can deliver, and the electability question is still a real one, even though polls now show him 'b'matching up well'b' against possible Republican opponents.'b'For instance, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s plan for universal health care is an admirable ambition of any true liberal, but as presented seems to me unworkable, and the prospect of getting it passed through this Congress or any Congress that vaguely resembles it is nil. Congress has voted to repeal Obamacare, which is far shy of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, more than 60 times. Suggesting that it would pass something even more expansive is mere fantasy.'b'When Sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical revolution,\xe2\x80\x9d which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the Senate and possibly the House.'b'Interesting, but also unlikely. Go talk to all the Blue Dog Democrats who lost their seats in the wake of Obamacare passage. Go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. Go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure Republican leadership, and therefore prevent Medicaid from being expanded in their states.'b'There are political realities that exist in America that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.'b'Furthermore, 'b'Sanders likes to tout'b' that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC\xe2\x80\x9d and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want one. That is a principled position. But the Republican candidate will have the support of many super PACs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the Republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. They are going to beat Sanders like he is a nail with the \xe2\x80\x9csocialist\xe2\x80\x9d label and his proposal on new taxation. Middle of the spectrum Middle America is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.'b'But instead of Clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s honor.'b'The swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-Obama because he wanted Obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap Obamacare, simply do not connect.'b'Sanders may be a dreamer, but he\xe2\x80\x99s not dishonorable. Trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.'b'There are a tremendous number of echoes starting to be heard between the way Clinton ran against Obama, and the way she is running against Sanders.'b'Clinton has what political insiders call the \xe2\x80\x9cfirewall\xe2\x80\x9d: Overwhelming support among black and Hispanic voters in Southern and some Western states. But a win by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could supply a boost of momentum that could greatly erode the Clinton firewall.'b'If Clinton can\xe2\x80\x99t find a positive, energetic message to project, and soon, she is going to be swept away by Sanders.'b'Some part of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s proposals and even his vision for this country may indeed be a fairy tale. But in the 2008 race, Bill Clinton 'b'criticized Obama'b' and his position on the Iraq war as a \xe2\x80\x9cfairy tale.\xe2\x80\x9d Well fairy tales sometimes come true, particularly when Hillary Clinton stumbles.'b'IN New York State, both the former Assembly speaker 'b'Sheldon Silver'b' and the former Senate majority leader Dean Skelos have recently been tried and convicted on numerous federal charges of corruption. They share another distinction: Since their trials, they have both applied for their state pensions. Sadly, they have every right to do so.'b'Under current law in New York, a former public official sitting in prison for a felony conviction for misconduct in office can still receive his or her pension checks. In the cases of Mr. Silver and Mr. Skelos, those payouts could easily total millions of dollars each.'b'And they will join a host of other former public officials, including but not limited to elected lawmakers who have been convicted of crimes related to their jobs but who are nonetheless receiving pensions. This is not only a waste of taxpayer money, but it also conveys the message that Albany tolerates \xe2\x80\x94 and is even willing to bankroll \xe2\x80\x94 those proved beyond any reasonable doubt to be corrupt.'b'Changing this situation for state and local officials requires an amendment to the New York State Constitution, which at present mandates that pension benefits not be diminished once someone enters the state pension system. (In 2011, a statutory change fixed this problem for new public employees, but it has no effect on a vast majority of New York\xe2\x80\x99s public officials, who served in some state or local capacity before the end of that year.)'b'While the constitutional provision protects those who serve honorably, those who dishonor their office by criminal conduct deserve no such protection. More than half of all states have passed some form of pension forfeiture for convicted public officials.'b'A constitutional amendment allowing the forfeiture of a pension following a felony conviction, with a judge allowed to weigh mitigating circumstances, would cause potential lawbreakers to think twice before committing the crime. Furthermore, it would at least begin to repay New Yorkers for the harm that befalls all of us when the public\xe2\x80\x99s trust is eroded by corruption.'b'In his most recent State of the State address, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reiterated his support for a broad pension-forfeiture constitutional amendment. His remarks follow encouraging statements from Assembly Speaker Carl E. Heastie and the Senate majority leader, John Flanagan, in their legislative session opening remarks. Last year, both the State Assembly and the Senate passed bills to amend the Constitution in this fashion.'b'While the pension-forfeiture bills differ in their scope and detail, both would be a significant improvement over the status quo. In theory, this should mean that this real reform can be achieved for New Yorkers in the very near future.'b'However, numerous obstacles lie ahead before this constitutional amendment can become law. I have served as the principal Assembly sponsor of this proposal for all three of my years in the State Assembly, so I am aware that not every player in Albany shares my belief that it is the right thing to do.'b'Some deny that corruption is a serious problem that can be addressed through legislation. Others refuse to support the amendment based on the mistaken premise that pension forfeiture harms the families of the convicted public officials; of course, it is the corrupt officials who harm their families when they violate the law.'b'Some public sector unions have also resisted this reform on the grounds that any reduction in pension rights will lead to broader pension reductions. I believe that, while perhaps well intentioned, they have things backward \xe2\x80\x94 the real threat to public pensions is the erosion of public support for them that occurs every time there is another headline about a corrupt official heading to prison who will continue to collect a full pension.'b'They have also expressed concerns that the law could be used unfairly against low-level employees. But the reform is specifically designed to target people convicted of felonies in connection with their office.'b'All of these objections can be taken up and resolved during negotiations. Ultimately, however, cynicism about New York State politics is the real barrier that needs to be overcome. Public support in polls for stripping pensions from corrupt officials is clear: For example, a Quinnipiac University poll last March found that voters supported pension forfeiture for elected officials by a margin of 76 percent to 18 percent. However, far too many of my colleagues believe that the public doesn\xe2\x80\x99t care enough about this issue to demand action.'b'If our state is to make real progress on our pressing needs, like improving education and growing our economy, there must be a base of public trust in our government. Pension payouts to convicted officials undermine that confidence.'b'If passed by two successive Legislatures (as required in New York), the pension-forfeiture constitutional amendment could be put before the voters for a referendum as early as November 2017. If not, New Yorkers may instead turn to another question on that November Election Day ballot \xe2\x80\x94 because every 20 years voters are asked whether a New York State constitutional convention should be called.'b'The Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s actions in 2016 will shed significant light on whether a constitutional convention is needed to clean up Albany and to honor our pledge of honest government. I hope we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait that long.'b'Congress has historically treated drug abuse as a malady afflicting mostly poor, minority communities, best dealt with by locking people up for long periods of time. The epidemic of drug overdose deaths 'b'currently ravaging white 'b''b'populations'b' in cities and towns across the country has altered this line of thinking, and forced lawmakers to acknowledge that addiction is a problem that knows no racial barriers and can be best addressed with treatment.'b'This realization is driving bipartisan support in Washington for saner, less punitive drug policies, some of which Congress had steadfastly resisted for decades.'b'Recently, Congress effectively lifted a destructive, longstanding ban that prevented state and local governments from using federal money on needle exchange programs. These programs have been shown to slow the spread of H.I.V. and other infections by giving intravenous drug users ready access to clean needles. A similar shift in attitude is reflected in bills like the 'b'Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act'b', which is pending in both houses of Congress. Its purpose is to expand and improve drug treatment services nationwide.'b'The need for such services was underscored in a recent 'b'Times analysis'b' based on data released by the 'b'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'b'. It shows that drug overdose deaths driven primarily by addiction to prescription painkillers and heroin had increased in nearly every county between 2002 and 2014, a year when more than 47,000 people \xe2\x80\x94 an average of about 125 a day \xe2\x80\x94 died of overdoses. Some medical experts likened the toll to the H.I.V. epidemic in the 1990s, but with this difference: Then, H.I.V. deaths were mainly centered in urban centers; now, rural areas have higher drug overdose death rates than large cities.'b'Drug addiction has been especially visible in New Hampshire, where voters have been raising the issue with visiting presidential candidates. The deadly drug of choice in New Hampshire is a brand of heroin mixed with a highly potent painkiller called fentanyl. In Appalachia, deaths frequently occur among injured workers who become addicted to widely prescribed painkillers.'b'In addition to driving up mortality rates, excessive use of painkillers costs the country tens of billions of dollars in lost productivity, medical complications and higher insurance costs.'b'The Recovery Act would attack these problems on several fronts. For starters, it would direct the secretary of health and human services to convene an interagency task force to develop a system of best practices for prescribing pain medications that would then be conveyed to doctors. It would authorize the attorney general to make grants to state and local governments, nonprofit agencies, and other entities to assist them on several fronts: expanding or developing alternatives to incarceration, such as treatment, for defendants who meet certain criteria; improving educational opportunities for offenders in jails, prisons and juvenile detention facilities; making more widely available the drug naloxone, which reverses the effects of an overdose; creating high-quality drug treatment programs; and establishing places where people with unused medications can safely dispose of them.'b'A particularly important provision in the bill would help states strengthen prescription drug monitoring systems. Insurers would be able to track pharmacies that illegally dispense drugs, as well as consumers who get unnecessary prescriptions from multiple doctors, either to satisfy their own habits or to sell them to other parties. The prescription data would also allow addiction treatment programs to make sure that patients take only the drugs required for their treatment regimens.'b'The act represents a rational approach to drug policy. It would be a first step in a long and difficult struggle to get the national addiction crisis under control, and it deserves approval as soon as possible.'b'It was so obvious, I\xe2\x80\x99m embarrassed I missed it.'b'Like most of the other talking heads on TV, I was haughtily dismissive of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s apparently open mike day in the Republican campaign for president,\xe2\x80\x9d I 'b'tweeted'b' last June, after Mr. Trump barged into a relatively placid Republican race with a rambling, riotous speech.'b'Even as he climbed to the top of polls, I confidently predicted that the outrageous Mr. Trump, as transfixing and ubiquitous as he was, was merely a summer fling. He would fade in the fall, when Republican voters got serious about making a long-term commitment.'b'Seven months later, Mr. Trump has broken just about every rule of conventional campaigning. Short on policy prescriptions and long on provocation, he has serially \xe2\x80\x94 and joyfully \xe2\x80\x94 insulted Mexicans, women, Muslims, P.O.W.s, people with disabilities and virtually all of his opponents. Yet a week before caucusing begins in Iowa, he still reigns supreme atop the Republican field.'b'What seemed impossible is now more than plausible: Donald J. Trump, the self-reverential deal maker, could pull off a hostile takeover of the Grand Old Party.'b'The galling thing is, if I had only reread my own words, written nine years ago to another aspiring candidate, I would have taken the Trump candidacy more seriously from the start.'b'In late 2006, when Barack Obama was a first-term senator pondering a long-shot race for the presidency, he asked me to write a strategic memo exploring his prospects. My bullish analysis was predicated on several factors, but rooted in a theory I had developed over decades as a political writer and campaign consultant.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the gist. Open-seat presidential elections are shaped by perceptions of the style and personality of the outgoing incumbent. Voters rarely seek the replica of what they have. They almost always seek the remedy, the candidate who has the personal qualities the public finds lacking in the departing executive.'b'A young, energetic John F. Kennedy succeeded the grandfatherly, somnolent Dwight D. Eisenhower, promising \xe2\x80\x9ca new generation of leadership.\xe2\x80\x9d In a slight variation, a puritanical Jimmy Carter, offering \xe2\x80\x9ca government as good as its people,\xe2\x80\x9d defeated the unelected incumbent Gerald R. Ford, who bore the burden of the morally bankrupt Nixon era.'b'Even George H.W. Bush, running to succeed the popular and larger-than-life Ronald Reagan, subtly made a virtue of his own lack of charisma and edge.'b'The pattern followed in 2008, as Mr. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s son completed his final term in office.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most influential politician in 2008 won\xe2\x80\x99t be on the ballot,\xe2\x80\x9d I wrote to Senator Obama in 2006. \xe2\x80\x9cHis name is George W. Bush.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the 2008 campaign began, many Americans and most Democrats saw Mr. Bush as rash, bellicose, divisive \xe2\x80\x94 oblivious to the demands and opportunities of a rapidly changing world. His presidency had come to be defined by the momentous decision to invade Iraq, which became a quagmire.'b'Senator Obama had 'b'publicly opposed'b' the war from the start, which separated him from most of the Democratic field. But more than that, his profile, temperament and approach offered the sharpest departure from those of the embattled, retiring president he would ultimately replace. For those who found President Bush wanting, Senator Obama was the most obvious remedy.'b'Today, after seven eventful years, attitudes toward President Obama will shape the selection of his successor.'b'The Republican base is infuriated by Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s activist view of government and progressive initiatives, from health care reform to immigration, gay rights to climate change.'b'Beyond specific issues, however, many Republicans view dimly the very qualities that played so well for Mr. Obama in 2008. Deliberation is seen as hesitancy; patience as weakness. His call for tolerance and passionate embrace of America\xe2\x80\x99s growing diversity inflame many in the Republican base, who view with suspicion and anger the rapidly changing demographics of America. The president\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on diplomacy is viewed as appeasement.'b'So who among the Republicans is more the antithesis of Mr. Obama than the trash-talking, authoritarian, give-no-quarter Mr. Trump?'b'His bombast allows no room for nuance or complexity. He proudly extols his intolerance as an assault against \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical correctness,\xe2\x80\x9d and he vows to bring the world to heel, from Mexico to China to Syria and Iraq.'b'Mr. Trump has found an audience with Americans disgruntled by the rapid, disorderly change they associate with national decline and their own uncertain prospects. Policies be damned, who better to set things right than the defiant strong man who promises by sheer force of will to make America great again?'b'Yes, we can? Hell, no!'b'Just leave it to me, Mr. Trump says. Yes, 'b'I'b' can!'b'The robust condemnations Mr. Trump has received from media and political elites have only intensified the enthusiasm of his supporters, many of whom feel disdained and forgotten by the very same people who regularly mock and chide their man for his boorishness. To his base, he\xe2\x80\x99s a truth-teller, thumbing his nose at conventional politicians, whether they are liberal or conservative. Rebukes from fact checkers and purveyors of civil discourse? They\xe2\x80\x99re just so much establishment claptrap.'b'Relentlessly edgy, confrontational and contemptuous of the niceties of governance and policy making, Mr. Trump is the perfect counterpoint to a president whose preternatural cool and deliberate nature drive his critics mad.'b'Mr. Trump may still stumble. His consistent lead in national primary polls may not hold as the Republican field shrinks and potentially coalesces around an alternative. As he himself 'b'suggested'b' a few months ago, people may tire of the show. We also don\xe2\x80\x99t know how the ebullient front-runner, who never fails to boast of his gaudy poll numbers, will react when and if he loses primary contests.'b'Unlike in 2008, when Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s appeal reached a majority of independents and even some Republicans, polling suggests that if he were nominated, Mr. Trump would face a steep uphill battle in a general election. As of today, he has the lowest standing, by far, of any major Republican candidate among Democrats and independent voters. His nativist rants have walled him off from the growing Hispanic vote, which could hold the key to several important swing states this fall.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s far too early to picture the iconic Trump logo affixed to the White House portico. But as the most ardent and conspicuous counterpoint to the man in the White House today, the irrepressible Mr. Trump already has defied all expectations. So, in the parlance of one of his signature businesses, \xe2\x80\x9cWho wants to bet?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The government of Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s departing president, Thein Sein, oversaw the systematic persecution of the country\xe2\x80\x99s Rohingya Muslim minority \xe2\x80\x94 a human rights debacle that one study has described as genocide. Mr. Thein Sein also signed four bills into law last year regulating interfaith marriage, birth spacing and religious conversion that clearly targeted Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s Muslim minority.'b'By the hundreds of thousands, Muslims in Myanmar have been stripped of their citizenship, sent to concentration camps where they are deprived of basic medical care, jobs and even food, and held prisoners in villages they are not allowed to leave. Thousands more have fled the camps by risking their lives at the hands of criminal syndicates that traffic them to Malaysia and Bangladesh or force them into servitude on fishing boats.'b'The question now is what Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will do to ease their plight. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the revered winner of the Nobel Peace Prize whose National League for Democracy party won a majority of seats in Parliament in November, was herself persecuted and held under house arrest. But during the campaign she remained stubbornly silent on the fate of the Rohingya, clearly a political calculation in a country where anti-Muslim sentiment had been whipped to a fever pitch.'b'Now that her party has won, as Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken pointed out at a meeting with leaders in Myanmar on Jan. 18, there is an urgent need to make sure the new government respects the human rights of all people when it takes power in March. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is already taking action to end festering conflicts between Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s military and armed ethnic groups, and promises to strengthen fragile democratic institutions and bring economic opportunity to Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s people.'b'But, as 'b'Nicholas Kristof'b' recently pointed out in a column in The Times, these are political challenges, while what has been done to the Rohingya is \xe2\x80\x9ca crime against humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As soon as the political transition is complete, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi and her party must move swiftly to redress discrimination against Myanmar\xe2\x80\x99s Muslims and to end the Rohingya\xe2\x80\x99s terrible plight. This means overturning Mr. Thein Sein\xe2\x80\x99s egregiously discriminatory laws targeting Muslims, restoring citizenship to the Rohingya and other Muslims, allowing the Rohingya to leave the squalid camps to return to their homes and businesses and to travel, and outlawing hate crimes and hate speech toward religious minorities.'b'Some of the American economic sanctions originally aimed at forcing the military regime to end abuses, loosen its grip and move toward democracy remain in place, prohibiting American companies from doing business with corporations and individuals tied to the generals. They should remain in effect until the new government makes tangible progress on all human rights fronts.'b'The New York City Council is poised to take what could be a step toward a fairer and smarter criminal justice system. A package of bills to be introduced on Monday seeks to resolve an old impasse over how to deter minor lawbreaking without punishing too many people unjustly.'b'The bills focus on so-called 'b'quality of life offenses'b' \xe2\x80\x94 things like littering, urinating and drinking alcohol in public, being too noisy and violating park rules. Police officers write up New Yorkers for such conduct hundreds of thousands of times a year. Under the Council plan, many more of these offenders would face civil summonses, not criminal charges. They would still be subject to fines and judgments, but in a civil court run by the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings.'b'No one can reasonably argue that the city should turn a blind eye to disorderly and disruptive public behavior. But overly harsh responses come at a great cost. They waste policing resources, clog the courts and jails, and shackle too many people \xe2\x80\x94 often the poor and those in black and Latino communities \xe2\x80\x94 with criminal records, putting them in danger of losing their jobs, homes and futures.'b'The bills don\xe2\x80\x99t pull the plug on possible criminal enforcement for scofflaws and repeat offenders. Police officers would still be allowed to treat minor offenses as misdemeanors, but they would be encouraged \xe2\x80\x94 under new policy guidelines for officers not yet completed or made public \xe2\x80\x94 to use the civil option in most cases.'b'The goal is balance, said the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito, calling the bills an \xe2\x80\x9cincremental\xe2\x80\x9d step toward a fairer society while preserving the tools to protect civil order. If the proposals work as promised, the police won\xe2\x80\x99t have to abandon \xe2\x80\x9cbroken windows\xe2\x80\x9d policing, but they will be less likely to afflict so many New Yorkers with arrest warrants, rap sheets and jail time.'b'Of course, reforming criminal justice is not the same as reforming policing. If officers still use too heavy a hand in communities of color, these changes may simply shift the consequences of unfair policing to a different court system. A fine for a first-time, low-level offense is obviously a better deal than jail. But injustice that is less damaging to people\xe2\x80\x99s lives is still injustice.'b'To help limit abuses, the bills include new public data-reporting requirements, on what tickets are issued and to whom. The information is meant to be a useful way to monitor the new system\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness. The reforms also include an option of community service for people too poor to pay fines.'b'The bills have already been denounced as too lax by critics of Mayor Bill de Blasio and Ms. Mark-Viverito who have spent the last two years predicting the return of the squeegee-and-graffiti apocalypse. They appear to believe that all offenders, no matter how minor their misbehavior, are on the path to robbery and murder. There is no evidence of that, but these critics have no interest in facts.'b'A more rational set of laws and punishments can keep the peace and ease the burden of overpolicing in communities of color. These proposed reforms seem like a helpful shift in that direction.'b'In the 1850s, London, the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest city, still didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a sewer system. Waste simply flowed into the Thames, which was as disgusting as you might imagine. But conservatives, including the magazine The Economist and the prime minister, 'b'opposed any effort'b' to remedy the situation. After all, such an effort would involve increased government spending and, they insisted, infringe on personal liberty and local control.'b'It took the Great Stink of 1858, when the stench made the Houses of Parliament unusable, to produce action.'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s all ancient history. Modern politicians, no matter how conservative, understand that public health is an essential government role. Right? No, wrong \xe2\x80\x94 as illustrated by the 'b'disaster in Flint, Mich'b''b'.'b''b'What we know so far is that in 2014 the city\xe2\x80\x99s emergency manager \xe2\x80\x94 appointed by Rick Snyder, the state\xe2\x80\x99s Republican governor \xe2\x80\x94 decided to switch to an unsafe water source, with lead contamination and more, in order to save money. And it\xe2\x80\x99s becoming increasingly clear that state officials knew that they were damaging public health, putting children in particular at risk, even as they stonewalled both residents and health experts.'b'This story \xe2\x80\x94 America in the 21st century, and you can trust neither the water nor what officials say about it \xe2\x80\x94 would be a horrifying outrage even if it were an accident or an isolated instance of bad policy. But it isn\xe2\x80\x99t. On the contrary, the nightmare in Flint reflects the resurgence in American politics of exactly the same attitudes that led to London\xe2\x80\x99s Great Stink more than a century and a half ago.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s back up a bit, and talk about the role of government in an advanced society.'b'In the modern world, much government spending goes to social insurance programs \xe2\x80\x94 things like Social Security, Medicare and so on, that are supposed to protect citizens from the misfortunes of life. Such spending is the subject of fierce political debate, and understandably so. Liberals want to help the poor and unlucky, conservatives want to let people keep their hard-earned income, and there\xe2\x80\x99s no right answer to this debate, because it\xe2\x80\x99s a question of values.'b'There should, however, be much less debate about spending on what Econ 101 calls public goods \xe2\x80\x94 things that benefit everyone and can\xe2\x80\x99t be provided by the private sector. Yes, we can differ over exactly how big a military we need or how dense and well-maintained the road network should be, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect controversy about spending enough to provide key public goods like basic education or safe drinking water.'b'Yet a funny thing has happened as hard-line conservatives have taken over many U.S. state governments. Or actually, it\xe2\x80\x99s not funny at all. Not surprisingly, they have sought to cut social insurance spending on the poor. In fact, many state governments dislike spending on the poor so much that they are rejecting a Medicaid expansion that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cost them anything, because it\xe2\x80\x99s federally financed. But what we also see is extreme penny pinching on public goods.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to come up with examples. 'b'Kansas'b', which made headlines with its failed strategy of cutting taxes in the expectation of an economic miracle, has tried to close the resulting budget gap largely with cuts in education. 'b'North Carolina'b' has also imposed drastic cuts on schools. And in New Jersey, 'b'Chris Christie'b' famously canceled a desperately needed rail tunnel under the Hudson.'b'Nor are we talking only about a handful of cases. 'b'Public construction'b' spending as a share of national income has fallen sharply in recent years, reflecting cutbacks by state and local governments that are ever less interested in providing public goods for the future. And this includes sharp cuts in 'b'spending on water supply'b'.'b'So are we just talking about the effects of ideology? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t Flint find itself in the cross hairs of austerity because it\xe2\x80\x99s a poor, mostly African-American city? Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s definitely part of what happened \xe2\x80\x94 it would be hard to imagine something similar happening to Grosse Pointe.'b'But these really aren\xe2\x80\x99t separate stories. What we see in Flint is an all too typically American situation of (literally) poisonous interaction between ideology and race, in which small-government extremists are empowered by the sense of too many voters that good government is simply a giveaway to Those People.'b'Now what? Mr. Snyder has finally expressed some 'b'contrition'b', although he\xe2\x80\x99s still withholding much of the information we need to fully understand what happened. And meanwhile we are, inevitably, being told that we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make the poisoning of Flint a partisan issue.'b'But you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand what happened in Flint, and what will happen in many other places if current trends continue, without understanding the ideology that made the disaster possible.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Proof That a Price on Carbon Works'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (editorial, Jan. 19):'b'It was heartening to read your editorial, just the latest sign that carbon pricing is becoming a more popular option for tackling climate change. Adopting an economywide tax will have the most impact in addressing climate change, changing industrial behavior and shifting away from fossil fuels.'b'Any tax must be set high enough to induce change in our energy mix, but not so high that energy prices skyrocket. To protect growth, any legislation must ensure that low-income consumers and small businesses are protected, that larger businesses aren\xe2\x80\x99t disadvantaged against foreign competitors in countries without carbon taxes, and that people in fossil-fuel-dependent communities get the support they need to transition into new industries.'b'Done right, carbon pricing can be a boon not just for fighting climate change but for moving our economy into the 21st century.

The province\xe2\x80\x99s emissions did drop slightly between 2008 and 2013, but the small reduction was spread out among all sources of emissions, including non-taxed mineral extraction and agriculture; the claim that the reduction was attributable to any tax on gasoline is highly suspect.'b'As with the tobacco tax, pricing carbon will have only a minor impact on behavior. It\xe2\x80\x99s the regulation of tobacco \xe2\x80\x94 smoking bans, for example \xe2\x80\x94 that have had a far greater impact.

(formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). More than a thousand companies worldwide, including most major hydrocarbon companies, are doing this or have pledged to do so within two years.'b'Rather than stand by while businesses and states price carbon individually, Congress should enact a revenue-neutral carbon fee. The proceeds could be used to fund long-overdue tax reform, cutting taxes for business and reimbursing lower-income families for paying a few cents more at the pump.'b'Our nonprofit has spoken with 175 members of Congress, or their aides, and there is bipartisan openness to considering this idea after the election.

Hasn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily been thrilling, but reliable. This year, though, the Democrats seem to be arguing about economic issues way more than your guys, who are obsessed with immigrants, terrorists and being politically incorrect.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with the basics. Does it seem to you that the Republican Party is imploding?'b''b'Arthur Brooks: 'b'Gail, I\xe2\x80\x99m delighted to join you, after enjoying your past conversations with our mutual friend, the other Brooks. This change sort of reminds me of those supporting-actor switcheroos they used to pull on TV, where you\xe2\x80\x99d say, \xe2\x80\x9cWait \xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t the husband on \xe2\x80\x98Bewitched\xe2\x80\x99 used be a different guy?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But yes, that election. Interesting times on both sides.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m not quite ready yet to concede that the Republican Party per se has fundamentally changed, mostly because Donald Trump is an island \xe2\x80\x94 an island where all the press has crowded. Most of the other candidates are trying to talk about things besides building walls. And downstream at the state level, the number of Republican governors has expanded to 31 from 19 during the Obama administration. When Republicans win Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois, you know they are doing something right.'b'Not too surprising, then, that Democrats are hoping to attach Trump to every pragmatic Republican at every level. One of the most ham-fisted attempts to do this came from the Democratic National Committee right before Thanksgiving. Inadvertently feeding the old trope about liberal hostility toward family values, they launched a misanthropic website called 'b'yourrepublicanuncle.com'b', which gave young people tips on how to shout down older Republican relatives at Thanksgiving.

It\xe2\x80\x99s true that a number of blue states have Republican governors right now. And New York City has had a lot of Republican mayors. To get elected, they convince voters that they\xe2\x80\x99re basically just thriftier Democrats. It works fine for state and local elections. But I\xe2\x80\x99m deeply dubious that these guys are a pipeline of potential presidential nominees. It\xe2\x80\x99s too hard for them to convince real, hard-core Republicans that they\xe2\x80\x99re reliable.'b'So I would concede that it\xe2\x80\x99s a weakness for the Democrats not to be developing a bigger farm team of politicians who can get Republicans to vote for them.'b'But now, having shown my evenhanded spirit, I would point out that the G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s local talent isn\xe2\x80\x99t translating well on the presidential stage. Jeb Bush is Mitt Romney without the electricity \xe2\x80\x94 hehehehe. And Chris Christie is going to do about as well as Rudy Giuliani did. John Kasich is the most interesting of the pack, but he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do well on TV. And you remember how well Scott Walker worked out.'b'You could posit that Donald Trump, Manhattan real estate celebrity, is the equivalent of a Democrat who learned to appeal to Republicans.

I\xe2\x80\x99m still studying up on what to tell my Republican uncle on, um, Groundhog Day.'b''b'Arthur'b': I agree with a lot of your assessment, but would add one not-very-original point. Part of the reason the more mainstream candidates have fared poorly is simply because there are many of them and that has fragmented the vote. We can identify three distinct groups within the national polls: Trump, at about 30 percent; Cruz, around 20; and Rubio-Bush-Christie-Kasich, with another 20-25.'b'Obviously, Trump is still outperforming the traditional candidates. But as a whole, that last group is still competitive \xe2\x80\x94 just not when it\xe2\x80\x99s split four ways. That will probably be the case until there\xe2\x80\x99s more winnowing in the field.'b''b'Gail'b': I like the winnowing image. Sort of enjoying the idea of Marco Rubio being winnowed. Chris Christie would be noisy, but Jeb Bush extremely quiet.'b''b'Arthur: 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWinnowing\xe2\x80\x9d could become a nice little corporate euphemism for downsizing. Or maybe a fad diet.'b'On the governors, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the conservatives in blue states have just been slightly thriftier Democrats. In Illinois, Bruce Rauner is really going after public sector unions, hammer and tongs. Of course, you could make the case that this will fail and Illinois will ultimately return to its old ways, electing governors who bankrupt the state while getting fitted for orange jumpsuits. But let\xe2\x80\x99s wait and see. I actually think that conservative reform is catching on at the state and local level.'b'But I have a question for you. As a committed progressive, why do you think so many people \xe2\x80\x94 including so many registered Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 are high on Donald Trump?'b''b'Gail'b': Well, he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly more interesting than your average politician. And he\xe2\x80\x99s got a really simple answer to everything. He\xe2\x80\x99ll fix whatever is wrong by making a deal with the bad guys. People have shorter attention spans these days and Trump doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require a whole lot of focus.'b'But as long as we\xe2\x80\x99re on the subject, what\xe2\x80\x99s your analysis?'b''b'Arthur'b': As a social scientist, I have been watching the so-called expert analysis unfold on this with real interest. From academia, explanations of Trumpism range from esoteric theories of disgust to simplistic accusations that working-class Republicans (and so-called Reagan Democrats) are just racists and xenophobes. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think these explanations ring true.'b'I think a big factor for a lot of people is the belief that Trump is sticking up for people who feel they have been treated with contempt. Going all the back to 2008 with Obama\xe2\x80\x99s infamous \xe2\x80\x9c'b'they cling to guns or religion'b'\xe2\x80\x9d line (at a fund-raiser in San Francisco, no less), there has been a tangible sense that this president cares more about virtually anyone else than he does about working-class people, who have been absolutely hammered by the recession.'b'A psychologist once told me that most human conflict stems from poorly concealed contempt. Research shows that contempt is the best predictor of divorce. And I think it is part of what has sparked the Trump movement.'b''b'Gail'b': That \xe2\x80\x9cguns or religion\xe2\x80\x9d moment has haunted President Obama for the last eight years. One of the first times a candidate got hammered when his private fund-raiser talk wound up on YouTube. Like I said, digital age.'b''b'Arthur'b': That sense of contempt had been brewing for a long time, but it didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much of a formal platform because the leading Democrat was still Bill Clinton, who isn\xe2\x80\x99t a contemptuous sort of person and has working-class roots. But a cultural cold war was in the works and that turned it hot.'b''b'Gail'b': We\xe2\x80\x99ve got a history in this country of populist heroes who direct the common man\xe2\x80\x99s general dissatisfaction toward other working-class folks with darker skins. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what Trump is doing.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he plotted this out. He just noticed that when he said stuff about Mexicans he got a great reaction. And off he went.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re going to target one group for popular rancor, I vote for the upper one-tenth of 1 percent. What do you think of Bernie Sanders?'b''b'Arthur'b': I admire Sanders for his integrity (if not his policies), which may put me in a group of one on the right. But then again I\xe2\x80\x99m the only conservative eating tofu on Thanksgiving.'b''b'Gail: 'b'O.K., at some point we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have to revisit the Thanksgiving tofu. Maybe after New Hampshire.'b''b'Arthur:'b' The whole thing is just so funny, though. The Democratic Party attempts a coronation instead of a competition, and they wind up with a challenge from yoursocialistuncle.com. Now my friends on the academic left get to choose between Mrs. Clinton and someone who thinks the university system should be administered like the D.M.V. In your immortal phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cHehehehe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Gail'b': Sad as it makes me, I have to acknowledge your chortling rights. Mrs. Clinton has a long list of accomplishments and talents that make her an excellent candidate. But she knew when she left the State Department that she\xe2\x80\x99d be running for president and the fact that she took millions and millions of dollars in speaking fees from hedge funds and investment banks is incomprehensible.'b''b'Arthur'b': Studies have found evidence of a certain dopamine allele, prevalent in politicians\xe2\x80\x99 brains, that makes it virtually impossible for them to pass on high consulting and speaking fees. Actually, I just made that up.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s your top-line take on Bernie Sanders?'b''b'Gail'b': Most Democrats like Bernie Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 pretty much everybody likes Bernie Sanders \xe2\x80\x94 but many of them don\xe2\x80\x99t think he can win. You begin to imagine the Trump presidency and you want to start a commune on a remote atoll.'b'Unfair question: If it did come down to Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, who would you vote for? What about Trump and Clinton?'b''b'Arthur'b': Ha. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to jam those scenarios into my brain at this point. And there might even be more choices: Mike Bloomberg 'b'is talking about running'b' and devoting a billion of his own dollars to the effort. Third-party runs have always been ill fated in the past, of course, but between his money and unclassifiable ideology, Bloomberg is kind of a political ninja. At the very least, he would scramble things in ways that will give us a ton to write about.'b'But what about you \xe2\x80\x94 I assume Trump versus Hillary is an easy call.'b''b'Gail'b': No problem here. I would vote for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Bernie Sanders over Donald Trump. I would vote for my local precinct captain over Donald Trump.'b''b'Arthur'b': I can imagine your local precinct captain reading this and saying to his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cHoney, come look at this! I 'b'knew'b' my chance would finally come.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What do you think about Bloomberg?'b''b'Gail'b': I\xe2\x80\x99m not a fan of third-party movements in general \xe2\x80\x94 I guess it\xe2\x80\x99s a lingering wound from Ralph Nader/Al Gore. But we\xe2\x80\x99ll see.'b'Hard to believe there\xe2\x80\x99s actually going to be voting in Iowa next week. We\xe2\x80\x99ve waited so long it\xe2\x80\x99s begun to seem less like an election calendar than an endless quest saga. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Hobbit, Part 7: The Desolation of Swaledale.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By the way, I think Ted Cruz looks a lot like 'b'Thorin Oakenshield'b', the crown prince of the dwarves.'b''b'Arthur'b': I gotta take your word for it because I\xe2\x80\x99m out of my depth with Hobbit references.

Great talking with you, Arthur. We\xe2\x80\x99ll be back next week with all Iowa, all the time.'b''b'Arthur'b': Great talking with you, too. Iowa, here we come.'b'A FEW days ago, I visited the shiny headquarters of the 'b'Peterson Institute for International Economics'b' on \xe2\x80\x9cthink tank row\xe2\x80\x9d in Washington \xe2\x80\x94 basically, the locker room of the Team Globalization and Free Trade cheering squad.'b'I was there to take part in a discussion of an old friend\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding book on the subject, Steven R. Weisman\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Tradeoff: Confronting Moral Conflicts in the Era of Globalization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After praising Steve\xe2\x80\x99s book, I emphasized that I had paid attention in economics class and understood that globalization incontrovertibly has benefited not only the world but also the United States. That\xe2\x80\x99s in part because trade permits Americans to buy goods at lower prices; the added purchasing power helps our economy expand faster.'b'But I soon pivoted to my experience working in the Obama administration on the auto rescue, an experience that had seared into me the sense that intermingled among the many winners from globalization were a substantial number of losers.'b'So far, so good. Then I went rogue and uttered two blasphemous words: \xe2\x80\x9cRoss Perot.\xe2\x80\x9d He had a point, I said heretically, when he campaigned in 1992 against the landmark North American Free Trade Agreement, saying that it would result in a \xe2\x80\x9cgiant sucking sound\xe2\x80\x9d of jobs headed south to Mexico.'b'A cool breeze drifted toward me.'b'As I looked out at my audience, I realized that the room was filled with winners \xe2\x80\x94 folks who, from all appearances, earned their livings from intellectual labor. Neither their jobs nor their wages were in jeopardy as countries ranging from Vietnam to Colombia became more competitive with us.'b'I pressed on.'b'Last year, according to the recent figures, our nation added 2.65 million new jobs. Just 30,000 of them were in manufacturing. So much for the widely trumpeted renaissance of Made in America.'b'At first glance, the automobile industry looks to be in better shape. From the depths of the crisis in 2009 through 2013, employment in the auto manufacturing sector in the United States rose by 23 percent, to 690,000 from 560,000.'b'That sounds pretty good, I said, except that employment in the Mexican auto sector rose to 589,000 from 368,000 during the same period, an increase of 60 percent. I\xe2\x80\x99m happy that 221,000 more Mexicans got jobs, but let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest: Absent open borders, many of those jobs would have been in America.'b'The wage picture looks even worse. Since January 2009, inflation-adjusted private sector wages across the economy have risen by 2.5 percent. In the fields of education, health and information, they are up by more than 3 percent. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, pay has fallen by 0.8 percent, and in the auto sector, by 12.7 percent.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLast point,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to the 100 or so guests: Average manufacturing compensation costs (includes wages and benefits) in the United States in 2012 were $35.67 per hour; in Mexico, they were $6.36 per hour. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd American auto executives will tell you that the productivity they get in Mexico is at least as good as what they get in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'My central argument was not that we should close our borders or retreat from the world; it was that we need to be sensitive to the losers and try to help. The point \xe2\x80\x94 well illustrated in Steve\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x94 is that globalization is not only an economic matter but also a moral one.'b'Presently, the institute\xe2\x80\x99s blunt director, Adam Posen, used his final moments to shut me down, declaring that the \xe2\x80\x9cfetishization\xe2\x80\x9d of any industry was \xe2\x80\x9cimmoral.\xe2\x80\x9d The problem of manufacturing is technology, he declared flatly.'b'Blaming technology is a common refrain from economists who hate the thought that globalization is not the world\xe2\x80\x99s unambiguous salvation.'b'Sorry, Adam, I thought silently, having been afforded no time to respond. If technology were the source of manufacturing workers\xe2\x80\x99 woes, productivity would be rising sharply, which it surely isn\xe2\x80\x99t (notwithstanding claims by some economists that official statistics have been understating efficiency gains).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t blame the robots for lost manufacturing jobs,\xe2\x80\x9d read the headline in a blog post last spring by two scholars at the venerable Brookings Institution.'b'I have never forgotten a powerful article I read in Foreign Affairs in 2007 that called for huge tax redistribution, both as a moral matter and as a mechanism for ensuring political support for free trade. (The authors were hardly left-wing shills \xe2\x80\x94 one had served in the administration of President George W. Bush.)'b'That still sounds like the right idea to me.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not only morally wrong to fail to help those on the losing end of globalization, but it will also end badly politically, as the ascendant candidacy of Donald J. Trump illustrates.'b'LAST March, the 'b'N.C.A.A.'b'\xe2\x80\x99s chief medical officer, Brian Hainline, announced that he was going to recommend that all male college basketball players undergo an electrocardiogram, which measures the electrical activity in the heart, presumably as a requirement for being cleared to play competitively. He said his action was in response to research suggesting that the risk of sudden cardiac death in Division I basketball players was about one in 5,200 per year, much higher than previously thought.'b'However, Dr. Hainline backed off his proposal after an outcry by about 100 college team physicians who questioned the use of electrocardiograms, or EKGs, as a screening tool for these athletes. EKGs can appear abnormal even in the absence of heart disease. These false positives, some physicians argued, would create a lot of unnecessary secondary testing, anxiety and sidelining of athletes, not to mention potential legal liability.'b'Those are legitimate concerns, but Dr. Hainline\xe2\x80\x99s original proposal was the right one: We should begin targeted screening of some groups of college athletes \xe2\x80\x94 starting with those in sports that recent research indicates pose a high cardiovascular risk, such as basketball and soccer.'b'The N.C.A.A. is currently developing guidelines for managing sudden cardiac arrest in its athletes. Expected to be released later this year, the guidelines are likely to endorse a standardized questionnaire on medical and family history, more training in CPR and increased access to automatic 'b'defibrillators'b'. However, they will almost surely not include EKG screening.'b'Several important organizations, including the European Society of Cardiology, the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, soccer\xe2\x80\x99s governing body, recommend EKG testing for competitive athletes. But in the United States, EKG screening is reserved only for professional athletes. (Italy and Israel mandate EKGs for collegians also.) It is a disparity that needs to be examined closely. Nothing suggests that college athletes are at any lower risk of sudden cardiac death than professionals.'b'Dr. Hainline\xe2\x80\x99s proposal came 25 years after perhaps the most famous incident of sudden death in college sports. On March 4, 1990, the Loyola Marymount University basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed while playing in a game against the University of Portland. His body convulsed on the hardwood floor, and despite shocks from a defibrillator, he could not be revived. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after.'b'Mr. Gathers\xe2\x80\x99s sudden death was never fully explained, though some media reports suggested he had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, an abnormally thickened heart that is the most common cause of sudden death in young athletes. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a heritable condition. Three years after Mr. Gathers died, his first cousin, a high school senior, also died while playing basketball.'b'Heart disorders like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are often detectable by a standard electrocardiogram. However, the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology are strongly opposed to routine EKG screening. Barry Maron, a Minneapolis cardiologist who was the chief author of a recent position statement by these organizations, argues that because of the low incidence of heart disease in young people, he believes the false positive rate will be too high \xe2\x80\x94 between one in three and one in seven, by some estimates.'b'Another reason, Dr. Maron says, that he opposes EKG screening is that there is a high likelihood of disqualifying athletes whose risk is small or difficult to quantify. For athletes who have spent much of their lives preparing to play competitive sports, such a prohibition is a tragedy.'b'But of course this tragedy pales before the tragedy of sudden death. Unfortunately there is no consensus on the incidence of sudden death in college athletes. Dr. Maron puts the rate between one in 50,000 and one in 100,000. However, research published last year in the journal Circulation by Dr. Kimberly Harmon and her colleagues found that the cumulative risk over a typical four-year career of a Division I male basketball player was a staggering 1 in 1,300, higher than his risk of dying in an automobile accident.'b'Some experts, including Dr. Maron, dispute this latest data, saying that it spuriously counts deaths from other causes, such as drug overdoses. But if it is correct, the incidence of sudden death is high enough to justify EKG or even ultrasound screening. Despite the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s own position, some individual college programs already require their athletes to undergo either test. A few require both.'b'There are about eight million high school and 460,000 college athletes in this country. Screening all these young people with EKGs will not be feasible. Many communities do not have experts available to properly interpret EKGs in well-conditioned athletes. Cost is also a consideration. Screening all these athletes would most likely cost billions of dollars.'b'But targeted screening of higher risk groups, such as basketball and soccer players, makes sense. In the final analysis it is a moral judgment. Are the anxieties and associated costs of false positives outweighed by that rare life that might be saved? Though we still need more study of this issue, we should, in the meantime, begin to screen the highest-risk college athletes.'b'A runoff election on Sunday for president in Haiti was 'b'postponed'b' indefinitely late last week. The decision made sense, because with protesters in the streets, violence and gunfire and the torching of electoral offices, it was clear that any vote would be marred by bloodshed and chaos.'b'It was also good because, with only one candidate participating, any result would be ludicrous and fraudulent.'b'That candidate is Jovenel Mo\xc3\xafse, a political unknown who is the handpicked successor to President Michel Martelly, whose term is up. Mr. Mo\xc3\xafse finished first in a first-round election in October, but that election was so tainted by accusations of rigged voting and intimidation that the runner-up, Jude C\xc3\xa9lestin, denounced the result and refused to campaign in round 2.'b'Mr. C\xc3\xa9lestin\xe2\x80\x99s argument, echoed by other opposition politicians, church and business leaders, members of the Haitian diaspora and human rights groups, is that the country\xe2\x80\x99s fragile democracy faces a crisis of legitimacy. Only by fully investigating last year\xe2\x80\x99s elections \xe2\x80\x94 including legislative elections in August that were also the subject of violence and fraud \xe2\x80\x94 and reforming the voting process can the country produce a government worthy of the citizens\xe2\x80\x99 trust. Earlier this month members of the Haitian Senate voted to urge that the runoff be postponed.'b'Mr. Martelly, naturally, disagreed, wanting to deposit his man in power before he leaves office on Feb. 7, as the Constitution requires. Late last week, as protests mounted, Mr. Martelly was still insisting that the election had to be held. He had the support of the 'b'United States'b', which has already spent more than $33 million on the election, the Organization of American States and other foreign governments that had been pressuring Haitian officials to proceed. Only when the threat of violence became overwhelming did Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s election officials decide to call things off.'b'In a 'b'statement'b' on Sunday, the State Department said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States reaffirms its support for credible, transparent and secure elections that reflect the will of the Haitian people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Well, yes, that would be good. But the conditions that permit such elections do not exist in Haiti now, and are not going to suddenly emerge in the next two weeks. They have not been nurtured for the last five years by President Martelly, who displays the strongman tendencies of Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s worst rulers, and who bears much responsibility for the crisis, having not called local and parliamentary elections for years. The terms of practically every elected official in the country have expired, allowing Mr. Martelly to rule by decree since January 2015.'b'Haiti was devastated by an earthquake six years ago this month. The rest of the world, particularly its neighbor the United States, rushed in 2010 with promises to help rebuild Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s shattered buildings and institutions. The job, tragically, was left undone, complicated by an imported cholera epidemic and continuing economic suffering. Now, Haiti is on the precipice again, because of a man-made disaster of dirty elections, an unsavory president and the threat of crippling instability.'b'The best result would be Mr. Martelly\xe2\x80\x99s departure, a brief period of transitional government and swift agreement among Haitian leaders on a program of electoral reform that enables free and fair elections. Haiti, with the support of the international community, must emerge from the crisis with a politics worthy of its people.'b'The Pentagon is ramping up intelligence-gathering in 'b'Libya'b' as the Obama administration draws up plans to open a third front in the war against the Islamic State. This significant escalation is being planned without a meaningful debate in Congress about the merits and risks of a military campaign that is expected to include airstrikes and raids by elite American troops.'b'That is deeply troubling. A new military intervention in Libya would represent a significant progression of a war that could easily spread to other countries on the continent. It is being planned as the American military burrows more deeply into battlegrounds in Syria and Iraq, where American ground troops are being asked to play an increasingly hands-on role in the fight.'b'Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 'b'told reporters on Friday'b' that military officials were \xe2\x80\x9clooking to take decisive military action\xe2\x80\x9d against the Islamic State, or 'b'ISIS'b', in Libya, where Western officials estimate the terrorist group has roughly 3,000 fighters.'b'Administration officials say the campaign in Libya could begin in a matter of weeks. They anticipate it would be conducted with the help of a handful of European allies, including Britain, France and Italy. The planning is unfolding amid political chaos in Libya, which continues to reel from the aftermath of the 2011 civil war that ended with the killing of the country\xe2\x80\x99s longtime dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi. In recent months the United Nations has struggled to persuade two groups of Libyan officials who claim to be the country\xe2\x80\x99s rightful leaders to band together. On Monday, the parliament that is recognized by the international community rejected a unity government proposal brokered by the United Nations.'b'The political strife and infighting among rival militias created an opening for the Islamic State in Libya in 2014. The extremist group now controls the coastal city of Surt, which lies between the country\xe2\x80\x99s two largest cities, Tripoli and Benghazi. General Dunford told reporters that striking the cells of Islamic State fighters in Libya would \xe2\x80\x9cput a firewall\xe2\x80\x9d between that front and sympathizers of the group elsewhere in North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.'b'That is a reasonable goal. But military officials have yet to make a persuasive case that it is achievable. Even if the Pentagon and its allies were to manage to strike Islamic State targets successfully, it remains uncertain that they would have a reliable ground force to hold the terrain. There\xe2\x80\x99s good reason to believe that airstrikes would create the temptation to deploy ground troops to gather intelligence and provide technical support to rebel forces as they have in Iraq and Syria.'b'On the same day General Dunford discussed the plans for Libya, Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter said the Pentagon was redoubling efforts to assist local forces in Iraq and Syria. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking for opportunities to do more, and there will be boots on the ground \xe2\x80\x94 I want to be clear about that \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s a strategic question, whether you are enabling local forces to take and hold, rather than trying to substitute for them,\xe2\x80\x9d he'b' told CNBC in an interview.'b''b'There seems to be little interest in Congress to authorize the campaign against the Islamic State, which is predicated, preposterously, on the 2001 law passed to take action against the culprits of the Sept. 11 attacks. The prospect of a new front in the war should spur lawmakers to revisit the issue.'b'The White House has said it would be nice, but not necessary, for Congress to pass a new authorization for the use of military force. That stance has allowed Congress \xe2\x80\x94 which has primary responsibility under the Constitution to declare war \xe2\x80\x94 to sidestep an important war vote.'b'In January of 2017 someone will stand at the U.S. Capitol and deliver an Inaugural Address. This is roughly the place where Abraham Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan once stood. I am going to spend every single day between now and then believing that neither Donald Trump nor Ted Cruz nor Bernie Sanders will be standing on that podium. One of them could win the election, take the oath, give the speech and be riding down Pennsylvania Avenue. I will still refuse to believe it.'b'Yes, I know what the polling evidence is telling us about Trump, Sanders and Cruz, but there are good reasons to cling to my disbelief.'b'First, these primary campaigns will not be settled in February. They won\xe2\x80\x99t be settled in March or April. Sometimes a candidate can sweep Iowa and New Hampshire and cruise to the nomination. But that candidate has to be broadly acceptable to all parts of the party. Trump, Cruz and Sanders are not.'b'As 'b'Jay Cost writes'b' in The Weekly Standard, \xe2\x80\x9cThis could mean a lengthy nomination battle that stretches all the way to the California primary in June.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the Republican side the early primaries and caucuses allocate delegates proportionally. Only 'b'16.2 percent of the delegates'b' over all come from winner-take-all states. That means the delegate-getting war will be a slog.'b'The first day when any candidate could rack up a big winner-take-all delegate harvest is March 15, an eternity from now. More than half the delegates will be allocated after that date.'b'Second, Cruz and Trump will go after each other with increasing ferocity over the next many weeks or months. There is a decent chance, given their personalities, that they will make each other maximally unattractive and go down in each other\xe2\x80\x99s death embrace.'b'Third, the Trump and Sanders turnout problems are real. Trump is doing very well among people who haven\xe2\x80\x99t voted in the past four elections. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible he has energized them so much they will actually caucus and vote, but you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to bet your gold-plated faucets on it. People who don\xe2\x80\x99t vote generally don\xe2\x80\x99t vote.'b'Sanders is drawing support from nonvoters, too. As 'b'Nate Cohn wrote'b' in The Upshot on Monday, Sanders is up in some polls over all, but he trails big time among people in Iowa who caucused in 2008 and among those who are definitely registered to vote.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s quite possible that the big story post-Iowa will be how badly these two underperformed.'b'Fourth, establishment Republicans who are softening on Trump because they think he is more electable than Cruz are smoking something. According to 'b'a Pew Research survey'b', a majority of Americans think Trump would make a poor or terrible president.'b'Chuck Todd ran through 'b'Trump\xe2\x80\x99s favorable-unfavorable ratings'b' on \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Meet the Press'b'\xe2\x80\x9d on Sunday: Among independents, Trump is negative 26 points; among women, negative 36; among suburban voters, negative 24. Is the Republican Party really going to nominate one of the most loathed men in American public life?'b'Fifth, America has never elected a candidate maximally extreme from the political center, the way Sanders and Cruz are. 'b'According to the FiveThirtyEight'b' website, Cruz has the most conservative voting record in the entire Congress. That takes some doing.'b'Sixth, sooner or later the candidates from the governing wing of their parties will get their acts together. Marco Rubio has had a bad month, darkening his tone and trying to sound like a cut-rate version of Trump and Cruz.'b'Before too long Rubio will realize his first task is to rally the voters who detest or fear those men. That means running as an optimistic American nationalist with specific proposals to reform Washington and lift the working class.'b'If he can rally mainstream Republicans he\xe2\x80\x99ll be at least tied with Trump and Cruz in the polls. Then he can counter their American decline narrative, with one of his own: This country is failing because it got too narcissistic, became too much like a reality TV show. Americans lost the ability to work constructively to get things done.'b'Finally, eventually the electorate is going to realize that in an age of dysfunctional government, effective leadership capacity is the threshold issue. That means being able to listen to others, surround yourself with people smarter than you, gather a governing majority and above all have an actual implementation strategy. Not Trump, Cruz or Sanders has any remote chance of turning his ideas, such as they are, into actual laws.'b'In every recent presidential election American voters have selected the candidate with the most secure pair of hands. They\xe2\x80\x99ve elected the person who would be a stable presence and companion for the next four years. I believe they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do that again. And if they\xe2\x80\x99re not, please allow me a few more months of denial.'b'Imagine you\xe2\x80\x99re discussing the presidential election with a group of friends who live in Iowa or New Hampshire. You ask them who they intend to vote for next month.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, whoever\xe2\x80\x99s the tallest,\xe2\x80\x9d one friend says. \xe2\x80\x9cSo Jeb Bush, I guess!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo way \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99m voting for Bernie Sanders,\xe2\x80\x9d another friend says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has a deeper voice, 'b'and'b' my best friend growing up was named Bernie.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It sounds ridiculous \xe2\x80\x94 like dialogue from \xe2\x80\x9cThe Twilight Zone\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s not too far off from the sometimes superficial shortcuts our brains use to make decisions.'b'Casey Klofstad, an associate professor of political science at the University of Miami, studies how social and biological factors affect human decision making. Last year, he collaborated on a 'b'study'b' with his wife, Rindy Anderson, a biologist who studies birdsong. They had subjects listen to manipulated male and female voices saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI urge you to vote for me this November.\xe2\x80\x9d The subjects then participated in a mock election. They 'b'found that'b' both men and women picked candidates with lower-pitched voices.'b'In the final week before the Iowa caucuses, candidates are making a mad dash to prove themselves the best option. They have six days to call voters, knock on doors and generally make their case before the first actual decision of Decision 2016 is made. But this down-to-the-wire effort to share policy proposals and paint their opponents as establishment shills or unelectable wacko birds probably matters less than candidates hope.'b'Often, seemingly superficial characteristics and split-second judgments can affect voters\xe2\x80\x99 decisions. Another study found that most American presidents are taller than average, and that voters tend to choose taller candidates. In the general election, the taller of the two candidates won roughly two-thirds of the time.'b'A 'b'2005 study'b' by the psychologist Alexander Todorov presented participants with photos of two congressional candidates, and asked them to choose which one looked more competent. More than two-thirds of the time, participants were able to pick the winner of each Congressional race just by how \xe2\x80\x9ccompetent\xe2\x80\x9d he or she looked. The keys to looking competent? A square jaw, an intense stare \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, not too far from Donald J. Trump on the cover of 'b'Time'b'.'b'There is also a well-documented primacy effect in voting: Candidates who are listed first on the ballot have been found to get 2.3 percent more votes on average than when they are listed farther down on the ballot. Having a familiar-sounding name has also been found to help candidates\xe2\x80\x99 electoral success. In Cook County, Illinois \xe2\x80\x94 home to Chicago, a city with the second-largest Irish-American population in the country \xe2\x80\x94 Irish-sounding last names have been thought to help candidates so much that in 2005, a candidate for Cook County judge legally switched from Frederick S. Rhine to Patrick Michael O\xe2\x80\x99Brien. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed like a very voter-friendly name,\xe2\x80\x9d he 'b'said at the time'b'. (So far it seems unlikely that the Irish Name Effect will pay off for one Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley, any more than it did for the new Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, 'b'who dropped out of his race'b'.)'b'What accounts for all this superficial reasoning? It comes down to something called decision heuristics, or mental shortcuts. As humans, we need to use our brain power efficiently. We do that by reducing the amount of effort we spend assessing each interaction, decision or task. Heuristics help us process the boatloads of information that we take in every day. As a result, we make decisions not by arduously ticking off a list of pros and cons, but by assessing the information, or cues, that are most readily available.'b'Some of these shortcuts can be built up over the thousands of daily encounters we\xe2\x80\x99ve had. For example, I tend to distrust people who unironically use the word \xe2\x80\x9c'b'synergy'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d It just makes life easier. Of course, there are instances when our own mental shortcuts and preconceptions distort the truth, and that is where our cognitive biases arise. The vocal pitch preference that Mr. Klofstad studies, for one, is pretty outdated. While voice pitch may be a sound proxy for figuring out which candidate may have the most testosterone, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily equate to being a better leader.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn human history, politics was about physical contact, fighting with rocks and sticks,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Klofstad said. \xe2\x80\x9cNowadays, war still matters, but our political battles are about ideologies and not physical conflicts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another example of this sort of cognitive bias is something called the \xe2\x80\x9cthird person effect,\xe2\x80\x9d according to David Greenberg, an associate professor of history at Rutgers University and the author of \xe2\x80\x9cRepublic of Spin'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Because we like to protect our own egos, we tend to not worry about our own susceptibility to biased judgment, while worrying about others\xe2\x80\x99 lack of savviness. That is to say, we only think other people\xe2\x80\x99s biases are a problem.'b'Daniel Oppenheimer, a psychology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author of \xe2\x80\x9cDemocracy Despite Itself,\xe2\x80\x9d said there are \xe2\x80\x9cthree I\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d that unite voters: ignorance, irrationality and incompetence. He says that as voters, we don\xe2\x80\x99t reflect on our own core beliefs and then seek out the candidate who best matches them. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s usually quite the opposite: We decide which candidate we like based on subjective cues, then mold our beliefs to fit theirs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost people have no idea where most candidates stand on most issues, so they just assume that the candidate agrees with them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople will actually change their position to align with the candidates they prefer, and will also assume that candidates agree with them on important issues, even when that isn\xe2\x80\x99t true.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say that shortcuts in decision making are necessarily bad; they are often good. It\xe2\x80\x99s evolutionarily beneficial for humans to be able to process a lot of information without shutting down.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHeuristics are usually very helpful. We wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t use them if they weren\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Oppenheimer said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just that sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99re not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Good politicians know that voters make a large share of their decisions superficially, which is why campaigns spend so much time and energy devising an effective image for their candidate. Aside from celebrities, there is no one who is more conscious of his or her own subconscious signals, vocal and visual cues than a presidential candidate. Even politicians who appear messy or unscripted to the layman\xe2\x80\x99s eye are most likely calculating how to appear that way to voters.'b'Remember when Senator Marco Rubio was spotted wearing 'b'shiny, high-heeled boots'b' while campaigning in New Hampshire? Since then, Mr. Rubio has been 'b'upping his machismo'b' on the trail.'b'In some ways, political parties are the original decision-making shortcut for voters. Don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about your local county clerk race, but identify as a Republican? There\xe2\x80\x99s an easy way to help you quickly decide whom you\xe2\x80\x99d probably rather see get elected. Candidate endorsements can also act as a mental shortcut \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI like Celebrity X, and she just endorsed Candidate Y, so I should support Candidate Y.\xe2\x80\x9d Being a single-issue voter is another way to ease decision fatigue. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lot easier to figure out where all the candidates stand on one issue that\xe2\x80\x99s important to you \xe2\x80\x94 abortion or climate change, say \xe2\x80\x94 than on every issue.'b'Mr. Oppenheimer said voting was a lot like grocery shopping, with more sensible but unappealing choices often losing out to tastier but less nutritious options. If someone like Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is a bag of low-calorie, gluten-free rice cakes, then Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, is a big box of chocolate-chip cookies. Mr. Kasich may not have his own line of festive hats, but he does have experience both in executive office and in Congress. Sensible policy solutions just don\xe2\x80\x99t taste as good as emotional appeals to fear and braggadocio promises to restore America\xe2\x80\x99s lost greatness.'b'This is not to besmirch the good name of chocolate-chip cookies, or to suggest that American voters should support candidates they don\xe2\x80\x99t find engaging. It\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable to expect every single voter in America to sit down and thoughtfully digest each candidates\xe2\x80\x99 policy proposals.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s simply silly to think that every single citizen is going to get up to speed on the differences between Medicare expansion and single-payer health care,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Greenberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cIndividuals shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be held to a standard of being public policy students. That\xe2\x80\x99s just not realistic. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how people live their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What we can do is try to consciously push back against some of our baser instincts. When you decide to vote for a candidate, ask yourself: Why do I like this person? What does he or she represent that I agree with? Instead of trying to deny our innate superficiality, maybe we should try to embrace it. After all, we\xe2\x80\x99re only human.'b'The Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly over the last decade that it is morally and constitutionally wrong to equate offenses committed by emotionally undeveloped adolescents with crimes carried out by adults. It made this point again 'b'on Monday'b' when it ruled that people who were sentenced to mandatory life in prison without the possibility of parole as juveniles have the right to seek parole.'b'The decision has its roots in the 2005 case of Roper v. Simmons, in which the court held that children under 18 were ineligible for the death penalty. It found that children were less culpable than adults and more likely to be rehabilitated, and that extinguishing their lives violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Five years later, the court outlawed sentences of life without parole for adolescents convicted of crimes other than homicide. In 2012, it went a step further, ruling in Miller v. Alabama that mandatory life sentences without parole were unconstitutional for adolescents.'b'The court left open the question of whether that ruling should be retroactively applied to about 2,000 people who were sentenced automatically to life without parole before the 2012 decision. On Monday, in 'b'Montgomery v. Louisiana'b', the court offered the answer: The constitutional rule announced in the Miller decision applies retroactively to that group.'b'The plaintiff in the case, Henry Montgomery, was 17 years old when he was convicted in 1963 of killing a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s deputy \xe2\x80\x94 a crime that carried an automatic sentence of life without parole. Mr. Montgomery, who has spent more than half a century behind bars, is said to be a well-behaved inmate.'b'Louisiana argued that the 2012 ruling need not be applied retroactively. But the court, in a 6-to-3 opinion written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, disagreed, writing, \xe2\x80\x9cThe court now holds that when a new substantive rule of constitutional law controls the outcome of a case, the Constitution requires state collateral review courts to give retroactive effect to that rule.\xe2\x80\x9d He also noted that \xe2\x80\x9cextending parole eligibility to juvenile offenders does not impose an onerous burden on the states\xe2\x80\x9d since prisoners who do not meet parole standards will continue to serve their life sentences.'b'The Montgomery decision will bring justice to some. But the court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that juveniles are less culpable than adults and more capable of rehabilitation suggests that the justices should take the final step. That means outlawing life sentences without parole for children altogether, whether mandatory or not.'b'DONALD J. TRUMP has made a shrewd bet. For the first time since he 'b'descended an escalator'b' in Trump Tower last June to announce that this time, he really was'b' running for president'b', he ceded control of his campaign message. He handed the Trump-bedecked podium over to 'b'Sarah Palin'b'.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bet: When the politician most fluent in American rage roars, the movement she gave voice to in the fall of 2008 will roar back today.'b'With his call to deport illegal immigrants, especially because Mexico sends us its \xe2\x80\x9c'b'bad ones'b',\xe2\x80\x9d his proposal to 'b'bar Muslims'b' from entering the country, his emphasis on the 'b'threats to lawful gun ownership'b' and his promise to protect American goods and workers from China, Mr. Trump is riding the wave of anxiety that Ms. Palin first gave voice to as Senator John McCain\xe2\x80\x99s running mate. Mr. Trump has now usurped and vastly expanded upon Ms. Palin\xe2\x80\x99s constituency, but the connection between the two movements is undeniable.'b'As a senior adviser to the McCain-Palin campaign in 2008, I understand why, to this day, Senator McCain remains gracious toward Ms. Palin. Despite her shortcomings, she brought out the largest crowds that we\xe2\x80\x99d seen since the campaign started. Voters stood for hours on the rope line to meet her. Her legacy lies in her innate ability to wrap herself in the anger that those voters felt. While Senator McCain seemed slightly unnerved by the intensity of their discontent, Ms. Palin basked in it.'b'I stood backstage at a rally in Minnesota in October 2008 where Senator McCain took the microphone from a woman in the crowd who spoke about her fears, including that Barack Obama was \xe2\x80\x9can Arab.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Senator McCain said,'b' \xe2\x80\x9cNo, ma\xe2\x80\x99am,\xe2\x80\x9d and explained that Mr. Obama was a good and decent family man and an American with whom he simply disagreed on policy matters. This 'b'interaction'b' will go down as one of the finest moments from one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s finest men. But it was also an early warning that the Republican base was profoundly agitated.'b'To some in the news media, voter anger seems like a new phenomenon. But they attended the same Palin rallies I did \xe2\x80\x94 we all should have seen this coming. The Alaska governor whipped the crowds into a frenzy with her fiery attacks on the media and the establishment politicians that she had gleefully upended in the Alaska statehouse. When her rallygoers shouted crude comments from the stands, as the woman at the Minnesota rally had done, there was no confrontation between Ms. Palin and the offender. When the press started to report on the angry rhetoric coming from those Palin crowds, I remember Senator McCain\xe2\x80\x99s concern. The growing furor in the Republican Party was something that we, as a campaign, failed to address, but to the crowds, Sarah Palin proved the more satisfying politician on the ticket because of it.'b'Ms. Palin owned the resentment voters in the Republican Party. They became her cause. And when the campaign concluded, she became the poster politician for the Tea Party movement. She was its first star, and hers became a coveted endorsement. Ms. Palin typically picks candidates who are trying to unseat incumbents and more experienced politicians, an ironic development considering that she was selected as a running mate to reinforce Mr. McCain\xe2\x80\x99s brand as a \xe2\x80\x9cmaverick\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 but a maverick who worked within the Senate and the Republican Party.'b'She has now turned the institutions in which he has proudly served into liabilities for the candidates running against her mama-grizzly-approved outsiders. The party bears some responsibility for her success. Our base has grown increasingly exasperated with Washington Republicans who, despite historic victories in the midterm elections of 2010 and 2014, seem incapable of reversing President Obama\xe2\x80\x99s legislative agenda or asserting themselves in the country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign policy debates.'b'Ms. Palin has amassed a decent record of success by endorsing conservative stars like Gov. 'b'Nikki Haley 'b'of South Carolina, Senator 'b'Joni Ernst'b' of Iowa and Ted Cruz, of Texas, in his 'b'Senate bid'b'. But no endorsement returned her to the spotlight like this embrace of Mr. Trump.'b'Mr. Trump improves upon Ms. Palin\xe2\x80\x99s jagged attempts at a post-2008 message with a vision for reclaiming American greatness by promising better trade deals, improved care for veterans, a more successful foreign policy based on his personal strength and immigration reform that is based mostly on building a wall. His proposals are, at best, vague and of questionable legal soundness, but they\xe2\x80\x99ve propelled his candidacy by inflaming voter concern that America has lost ground.'b'That he would refine and recalibrate his proclamations in a general election or as president is a widely held assumption among the Republican establishment. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that this is the kind of false comfort that people on a sinking ship murmur to one another about how death by drowning really isn\xe2\x80\x99t a bad way to go.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99ll never know if Sarah Palin would have taken her turn atop the polls at any point during this year\xe2\x80\x99s Republican primary if she\xe2\x80\x99d decided to run. Her inclusion may be the only thing that could have made it more extraordinary. During Ms. Palin\xe2\x80\x99s 37-minute score settling-slash-endorsement address last week, Mr. Trump seemed, at times, uncomfortable and eager for her to wrap things up. Should he come out on top in Iowa, he has her to thank.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Bloomberg Is Considering 3rd-Party Bid'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 24):'b'I am excited to read that Michael R.

It brought the Charlie Hebdo massacre, the Paris massacre, the San Bernardino slaughter, the rise and internationalization of ISIS, the death toll in Syria to about 250,000, the arrival of over one million desperate migrants and refugees in Europe, dead little Alan Kurdi on a Turkish beach, a senseless Saudi war in Yemen, Putin offensives on various fronts, the warmest year on record, American bombing of a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Afghanistan, and sundry other disasters.'b'At least an American Embassy in Havana opened.

My mother and six younger siblings and I suddenly became eight of the world\xe2\x80\x99s 4.5 million Syrian refugees, and we have been living with 80,000 of them in our camp ever since.'b'Life in a refugee camp was different from what I\xe2\x80\x99d expected. While it is hard in many ways, it has challenged me to be stronger and more independent. Now I am sharing my experiences in this Op-Doc video, which I made through a media workshop at an activity center in the camp in 2014, working with a visiting filmmaker to film as much of my life as I could.'b'Before learning to film, I felt like there was a huge part missing in my life. The only thing that filled it for me was filming. Filming makes me feel accomplished. I used to be shy, but when I started learning how to film, and also realized that the image of a refugee camp can be distorted by portrayals by outsiders, I knew that I needed to overcome this shyness \xe2\x80\x94 to speak not only to the community around me, but to people in the rest of the world. I walk through my days with my camera always in my hand, and when I encounter a scene I think people would be interested in seeing, I film it \xe2\x80\x94 life as it is.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m filming from my own personal perspective. I live in the camp, I am within the camp, and I know the camp. An outsider will miss a lot of the deeper meanings because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t felt what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to live here.'b'Now I am trying to pass on what I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned about filmmaking to younger girls in this camp. I want to show the rest of the world that even though we live in a refugee camp, and have different lives from others, we still have dreams and ambitions. We are creative. We strive to rise above our limitations and work toward our dreams. I feel it\xe2\x80\x99s my responsibility not just to tell the world that truth, but to let people see it for themselves.'b''b'This video is part of a series produced by independent filmmakers who have received support from the nonprofit Sundance Institute.'b''b'OSCEOLA, Iowa \xe2\x80\x94 For a few minutes I wondered if I\xe2\x80\x99d wandered into the wrong barn.'b'Rick Perry, the former Texas governor, was introducing the candidate I\xe2\x80\x99d come to see, but with descriptions that bore no relation to the candidate I\xe2\x80\x99d come to know.'b'He called this man \xe2\x80\x9cone of the great listeners that I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever been around in my entire life.\xe2\x80\x9d He praised him as \xe2\x80\x9ca person who is full of humility.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then it hit me: Perry was playing defense and asserting the precise virtues that the candidate famously lacks.'b'Because when most people think of Ted Cruz, they don\xe2\x80\x99t think: listener.'b'And when Cruz took the microphone and made his remarks, I hardly thought: humble.'b'It was Tuesday morning, six days until the caucuses. Dozens of voters sat among bales of hay and cows could be heard mooing in the background at such perfectly staggered intervals that I suspected a soundtrack rather than the real thing.'b'Cruz explained what he regarded as the seven battles of our time, and guess who was the conquering hero in each? (Hint: not Barack Obama.) He expressed the need for a Ronald Reagan of the here and now, and guess who\xe2\x80\x99s perfect for the part? (Hint: not Donald Trump.)'b'His voice swelled and swooped and dropped at times to a whisper so fraught with foreboding that it belonged in a bad afternoon soap. There are speakers who smoothly get the job done, and then there are those who dance to the music of their own voices, pirouette after pirouette. Cruz is the 2016 campaign trail\xe2\x80\x99s prima ballerina.'b'But then Trump is its black swan.'b'As each tries to muscle the other into the wings, they emphasize their contrasts. So does the media, describing the dissimilar paths that these two Republican front-runners traveled.'b'But to me they\xe2\x80\x99re as alike as they are different, with an overlap that helps to explain the intensely, passionately negative reactions they elicit. They\xe2\x80\x99re both transcendently \xe2\x80\x94 and transparently \xe2\x80\x94 self-serving and self-infatuated. They scale new pinnacles of egotism in a profession (politics) and pursuit (the presidency) that\xe2\x80\x99s already a veritable mountain range of it.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re grim prophecies come true. Many of us have worried that the increasingly circuslike, invasive, round-the-clock nature of modern campaigns would frighten off anyone with an inkling of modesty, an iota of self-doubt. Who would endure this ordeal and make this bargain?'b'The answer, all too often, is someone who finds the spotlight so mesmerizing that the ugliness on its periphery doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter, or someone whose hunger for validation is so prodigious that only Air Force One will sate it.'b'Here in Iowa four years ago, I marveled at the Everest of vanity that was Newt Gingrich. But he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even reach base camp on the slopes of Trump, whose campaign is one bottomless, boundless soliloquy of self-congratulation. 'b'On Sunday'b' he stunned journalists by sitting through a church service, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really the religious gesture that impressed them. It was the fact that for a solid hour, he assumed a posture of deference, and he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t brag.'b'Cruz is cut from the same flamboyant cloth. It\xe2\x80\x99s striking how many explorations of his past wind up focusing on the magnitude of his confidence, the scale of his ambitions and the off-putting nakedness of both.'b'As a cocky teenager, he said that 'b'his life goals'b' were to \xe2\x80\x9ctake over the world, world domination, you know, rule everything.\xe2\x80\x9d He separately wrote of plans to \xe2\x80\x9cachieve a strong enough reputation and track record to run for \xe2\x80\x94 and win \xe2\x80\x94 president of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That last detail comes from 'b'a recent story'b' in Politico whose themes included Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s zest for attention, quickness to grab credit and utter self-consumption. It opened with a scene in which Cruz, gearing up to run for the Senate, visits George W. Bush to get his backing, then holds forth at such tone-deaf length about his disruptive plans for the Republican Party that the former president is appalled and repelled.'b'In The Times on Monday, Matt Flegenheimer 'b'noted'b' discrepancies between Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s accounts of his vital contributions to Bush\xe2\x80\x99s legal team during the 2000 Florida recount and the memories of others. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of people who claim to be in Florida at the time of the recount,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Allbaugh, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s campaign manager, told Flegenheimer.'b'Every successful politician is a self-promoter. Every campaign is a sequence of boasts. In an ideal political environment, the narcissism is tempered and the worst narcissists foiled.'b'But the current ecosystem is toxic, and Trump and Cruz flourish. Neither demonstrates an especially robust appetite for listening, though listening is important. Both are full of a great many things. Humility isn\xe2\x80\x99t among them.'b'The 'b'sudden resignation'b' of the federal pardon attorney, Deborah Leff, an Obama appointee, is the latest evidence that until the clemency process is pried from the grip of the Justice Department, it will remain broken.'b'The pardon attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, which operates out of the Justice Department, is responsible for reviewing thousands of petitions for pardons and sentence commutations and for making recommendations for clemency to the president. The president\xe2\x80\x99s power to grant mercy in these cases is nearly unlimited, but for most of his time in office, Mr. Obama, like his recent predecessors, has exercised this power only rarely.'b'Since 'b'2014'b', Mr. Obama has focused more attention on this issue. To overhaul the notoriously backlogged pardon office, he 'b'announced new standards'b' encouraging tens of thousands of federal prisoners to request reductions of their inordinately long drug sentences.'b'And he hired Ms. Leff to replace Ronald Rodgers, whose incompetent tenure included a 'b'finding'b' by the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s inspector general that in 2008 he hid information from President George W. Bush in recommending the denial of a clemency petition.'b'Ms. Leff\xe2\x80\x99s appointment was a promising sign that the dysfunctional pardon process would be repaired. But her tenure didn\xe2\x80\x99t last long. On Jan. 15, barely one year after she was formally appointed, she abruptly announced she would step down at the end of this month, saying only that the work of the office should \xe2\x80\x9cmove ahead expeditiously and expand.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As she leaves, more than 10,000 clemency petitions are waiting for review. While the pardon office, which has 10 lawyers, has remained virtually the same size it was 20 years ago, the number of petitions has increased almost sevenfold. The department 'b'recently announced'b' plans to hire 16 new lawyers, but this would still be far below the number needed to process the backlog.'b'The lack of resources is only part of a deeper problem, which is that the pardon office is caught in an incurable institutional conflict. The deputy attorney general has authority to review the pardon attorney\xe2\x80\x99s clemency recommendations, and federal prosecutors generally have little interest in revisiting or undoing the department\xe2\x80\x99s convictions. As one former pardon attorney 'b'put it'b', the prosecutors are \xe2\x80\x9cdeterminedly and irreconcilably hostile\xe2\x80\x9d to clemency.'b'This conflict has stymied presidents for decades, but Mr. Obama is under no obligation to leave the process in prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 hands. He can 'b'end this blockage'b' either by running the pardon office directly out of the White House or by appointing an independent commission, as several states have done to improve and streamline their clemency processes.'b'Executive clemency is a critical check on a justice system that can impose wantonly excessive punishments without good reason. Right now, the most significant criminal-justice reform package, which would, among other changes, reduce unjustly long drug sentences, is teetering on the edge of collapse in Congress. Whether it will survive is anyone\xe2\x80\x99s guess.'b'But there is no question that Mr. Obama has the power to revitalize clemency and deliver more justice to more people, if only he would wield it.'b'IT has become part of the accepted history of our time: The bursting of the housing bubble was the primary cause of a financial crisis, a sharp recession and prolonged slow growth. The story makes intuitive sense, since the economic crisis included a collapse in the prices of housing and related securities. The movie \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Short,\xe2\x80\x9d which is based on a book by Michael Lewis, takes this cause-and-effect relationship as a given.'b'But there is an alternative story. In recent months, Senator Ted Cruz has become the most prominent politician to give voice to the theory that the 'b'Federal Reserve'b' caused the crisis by tightening monetary policy in 2008. While Mr. Cruz (who is an old friend of one of the authors of this article) has been criticized for making this claim, he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t back down. He\xe2\x80\x99s right, and our understanding of the great recession needs to be revised.'b'What the housing-centric view underemphasizes is that the housing bust started in early 2006, more than two years before the economic crisis. In 2006 and 2007, construction employment fell, but overall employment continued to grow, as did the economy generally. Money and labor merely shifted from housing to other sectors of the economy.'b'This housing decline caused financial stress by sowing uncertainty about the value of bonds backed by subprime mortgages. These bonds served as collateral for institutional investors who parked their money overnight with financial firms on Wall Street in the \xe2\x80\x9cshadow banking\xe2\x80\x9d system. As their concerns about the bonds grew, investors began to pull money out of this system.'b'In retrospect, economists have concluded that a recession began in December 2007. But this recession started very mildly. Through early 2008, even as investors kept pulling money out of the shadow banks, key economic indicators such as inflation and nominal spending \xe2\x80\x94 the total amount of dollars being spent throughout the economy \xe2\x80\x94 barely budged. It looked as if the economy would be relatively unscathed, as many forecasters were saying at the time. The problem was manageable: According to Gary Gorton, an economist at Yale, roughly 6 percent of banking assets were tied to subprime mortgages in 2007.'b'It took a bigger shock to the economy to bring the financial system down. That shock was tighter money. Through acts and omissions, the Fed kept interest rates and expected interest rates higher than appropriate, depressing the economy. This point is easy to miss because the Fed lowered interest rates between September 2007 and April 2008. But raising rates is not the only route to tighter money.'b'Between late April and early October, the Fed kept the interest rate over which it has most direct control, the federal funds rate, at 2 percent. But when the economy weakens, the \xe2\x80\x9cnatural\xe2\x80\x9d interest rate \xe2\x80\x94 the rate that keeps the economy on an even keel \xe2\x80\x94 falls. By staying in place, the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s target interest rate was rising relative to that natural rate. The gap between expected interest rates and the natural rate was rising even more. Fed officials spent the late spring and summer of 2008 warning that rates would have to rise to combat inflation. Futures markets showed a sharp increase in expected interest rates.'b'Market indicators of expected inflation fell sharply that summer, a sign that the economy was getting weaker and monetary policy tighter. Nominal spending showed the change. After growing for years at a relatively steady rate, it began to drop.'b'In their early August meeting, some Fed policy makers nonetheless anticipated that they would raise rates soon. Inflation expectations and nominal spending kept falling. In mid-September, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the Fed refused to cut interest rates further, citing the risk of inflation. (To his credit, Chairman Ben Bernanke subsequently admitted that not cutting rates then was a mistake.) It did not cut rates until weeks after the crisis had become undeniable.'b'It was against this backdrop of tighter money that the financial stress of 2007 turned into something far worse in 2008. With nominal spending falling at the fastest rate since the Depression, households, businesses and banks all had incomes lower than they had expected. That made servicing debts and paying wages harder than expected. It also lowered asset values, since those were premised on expected streams of future income.'b'And, of course, the crashing economy made the housing crisis worse, too. That\xe2\x80\x99s why the standard account of the crisis took hold. It\xe2\x80\x99s true, after all, that housing fell and then, along with the economy, plummeted. Untangling cause and effect is tricky. But the timeline is a better match for the theory that the Fed is to blame. The economy started to tank not right after housing began to fall, but right after money tightened.'b'We could have had a decline in housing without a Great Recession. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we went through for two years. What we could not have had without a Great Recession was a decline in nominal spending. If it had cut rates faster, or merely refrained from talking up future rate increases, the Fed might have kept that decline from happening or at least moderated it. Australia had a housing boom and debt bubble, too, but kept a steadier monetary policy. The consequence was a mild correction, but nothing like our Great Recession.'b'It took decades for the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for 'b'the Great Depression'b' to be widely accepted and it may take that long for most people to see its responsibility this time around. The Fed of 2008 feared inflation too much and recession too little. It placed too little weight on market expectations about future conditions and on how its behavior affected those expectations. If these mistakes go unrecognized, they could well be repeated.'b'Whether the winner of the 2016 presidential election emphasizes optimism or pessimism, he or she will face some sobering economic developments.'b'The first is the acceleration of corporate mergers. Why does this phenomenon matter? As Robert Litan, the chief economic adviser to Patent Properties Inc., 'b'explained last summer in the Wall Street Journal'b', it\xe2\x80\x99s'b'According to Litan, the increased number of mergers'b'A 'b'National Bureau of Economics working paper'b' released last month reinforces Litan\xe2\x80\x99s point.

If Gordon is right, whoever holds the White House after Jan. 20, 2017, will find the job as frustrating as it is rewarding.'b'In an email, Gordon forecasts a 0.3 percent annual growth rate of \xe2\x80\x9cmedian disposable income per person after taxes and transfers\xe2\x80\x9d for the period from 2015 to 2040 \xe2\x80\x94 one sixth the 1.69 percent rate from 1920 to 2014. Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s apprehension is based in part on his findings, which show the rise and fall of productivity (you can see this in the accompanying chart).'b'In addition to the slowdown in innovation, Gordon sees four \xe2\x80\x9cheadwinds\xe2\x80\x9d: the aging of the population, the decline of American education in comparison to foreign nations, rising inequality which, among other things, diminishes consumer purchasing power, and the growing federal debt burden.'b'Larry Summers, the former Treasury secretary, now a professor of economics at Harvard, makes a parallel argument \xe2\x80\x94 that the United States faces the danger of sustained \xe2\x80\x9csecular stagnation.\xe2\x80\x9d The tenor of Summers\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is reflected in the title of a blog post he published in November: \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Advanced economies are so sick we need a new way to think about them'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A key element of the 'b'Summers argument'b' is that since the end of the recession of 2008-9,'b'The lingering effects of the Great Recession, 'b'according to Summers'b', cast doubt on \xe2\x80\x9cthe economy\xe2\x80\x99s future potential.\xe2\x80\x9d One of the consequences, in Summers\xe2\x80\x99s view, is what economists call \xe2\x80\x9c'b'hysteresis'b'\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 a term he 'b'defines'b' as: \xe2\x80\x9cthe shadow cast forward on economic activity by adverse cyclical developments.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Hysteresis'b', as Investopedia puts it, sounds like something we have seen developing in America, particularly with sinking job force participation numbers (despite lower unemployment):'b'The views of both Summers and Gordon are controversial, and disputed by other scholars.'b'For example, a colleague of Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s in the Northwestern economics department, Joel Mokyr, a leading 'b'techno-optimist'b', is on the other side of this debate.

Big ticket items \xe2\x80\x94 a major boost in infrastructure spending, enactment of a federally directed program of school reform and alteration of tax and spending programs to redistribute income appear to be out of reach.

Democrats themselves have misgivings \xe2\x80\x94 ranging from teacher union rejection of school reform to the opposition of upscale Democrats to redistributive tax policies.'b'Perhaps, then, Gordon\xe2\x80\x99s pessimism is justified. \xe2\x80\x9cHypothetical legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes:'b'When asked why he sought to cross the Antarctic unassisted and unsupported \xe2\x80\x94 with no supply drops or help from dogs, sails or any other source \xe2\x80\x94 Henry Worsley would say it was to raise money to help wounded soldiers.

But like the great explorers Mr. Worsley so admired, the 'b'quest that took his life'b' was far greater and far harder to define.'b'That was less of a problem for earlier explorers like Marco Polo or Christopher Columbus, for whom there were always great treasures to discover or blank spots to fill on their maps. For the later adventurers there was always the challenge of the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 first to reach the earth\xe2\x80\x99s poles, first to climb Mount Everest, first to walk on the moon. It may be more difficult now, when so much is known and when adventures have been relegated to reality shows, to identify a genuine quest, but the longing to test oneself against the extreme and the unknown seems as powerful as ever.'b'Why? \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s there,\xe2\x80\x9d was the famous response the mountaineer George Mallory gave to a reporter from The New York Times when asked why he wanted to climb Mount Everest. 'b'Felicity Aston'b', the British meteorologist who achieved many firsts for women, including a solo crossing of the Antarctic in January 2012 (with supply drops, in contrast to Mr. Worsley) offered this explanation: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I look at a map of the world, my eye tends to wander to the fringes \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s where I want to be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Worsley, 55, would no doubt agree. A retired British Army officer and friend of Britain\xe2\x80\x99s royal princes William and Harry, Mr. Worsley was passionately interested in the explorers of the \xe2\x80\x9cheroic age of Arctic exploration\xe2\x80\x9d a century ago \xe2\x80\x94 Sir Ernest Shackleton, Robert Scott, Roald Amundsen. Mr. Worsley had already led expeditions following each of their celebrated Antarctic routes; his latest plan was to make the trek across Antarctica that Sir Ernest had failed to make in 1915 when his ship became stranded in ice \xe2\x80\x94 and to do so on his own, dragging a sled with all his supplies and equipment over 1,100 miles.'b'On Day 71 of the brutal voyage, with just 30 miles left to go, Mr. Worsley, exhausted, and suffering, as doctors subsequently discovered, from bacterial peritonitis, was compelled to give up. He was flown to a hospital in southernmost Chile, where on Sunday he died. In his last audio broadcast on Friday, he recalled that when Sir Ernest abandoned an attempt to reach the South Pole in 1909, he said he\xe2\x80\x99d shot his bolt. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, today I have to inform you with some sadness that I, too, have shot my bolt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'STOCKHOLM \xe2\x80\x94 Now in his last year in office, 'b'President Obama'b' is in legacy mode. He has much to be proud of. But if he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want his achievements muddied by foreign policy, he\xe2\x80\x99ll spend his last year redoubling his efforts to contain the Middle East refugee crisis before it goes from a giant humanitarian problem to a giant geostrategic problem that shatters America\xe2\x80\x99s most important ally: the 'b'European Union'b'.'b'I know \xe2\x80\x94 putting \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean Union\xe2\x80\x9d into the lead of a column published in America is like a \xe2\x80\x9cDo Not Read\xe2\x80\x9d sign. Maybe I should call it \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x99s European Union.\xe2\x80\x9d That would go viral. But for the two of you still reading, this is really important.'b'The meltdowns of Syria, Somalia, Eritrea, Mali, Chad and Yemen and our takedowns of Libya, Iraq and Afghanistan \xe2\x80\x94 without proper follow-up on our part, 'b'NATO'b'\xe2\x80\x99s part or by local elites \xe2\x80\x94 has uncorked the worst refugee crisis since World War II. This tidal wave of migrants and refugees is a human tragedy, and their outflow from Syria and Libya in particular is destabilizing all the neighboring islands of decency: Tunisia, Jordan, Lebanon, Kurdistan and Turkey. And now it is eating away at the fabric of the E.U. as well.'b'Why should Americans care? Because the E.U. is the United States of Europe \xe2\x80\x94 the world\xe2\x80\x99s other great center of democracy and economic opportunity. It has its military shortcomings, but with its wealth and liberal values, the E.U. has become America\xe2\x80\x99s primary partner in addressing climate change, managing Iran and Russia and containing disorder in the Middle East and Africa.'b'This partnership amplifies American power and, if the E.U. is hobbled or fractured, America will have to do so many more things around the world with much less help.'b'At a seminar in Davos, Switzerland, sponsored by the Wilson Center, I interviewed David Miliband, president of the International Rescue Committee, which oversees relief operations in more than 30 war-affected countries. He made 'b'several key points'b'.'b'First, one in every 122 people on the planet today is \xe2\x80\x9cfleeing a conflict\xe2\x80\x9d at a time when wars between nations \xe2\x80\x9care at a record low,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miliband, a former British foreign secretary. Why? Because we now have nearly 30 civil wars underway in weak states that are \xe2\x80\x9cunable to meet the basic needs of citizens or contain civil war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Second, he said, last year the rescue committee assisted 23 million refugees and internally displaced individuals. Some 50 percent of those going to Europe come directly out of Syria and most of the rest come from Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia and Eritrea \xe2\x80\x94 and the international humanitarian relief system \xe2\x80\x9cis now being overwhelmed by the numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last year, within the E.U. bloc there were 56 million truck crossings between countries and every day 1.7 million crossings by people. Preserving that free movement of trucks, trade and people, Miliband added, is a huge \xe2\x80\x9ceconomic prize,\xe2\x80\x9d but it will not be sustained if E.U. countries feel swamped by refugees who can\xe2\x80\x99t be properly registered or absorbed.'b'More and more countries are now sealing their borders, and anti-immigrant parties are rising everywhere. Sweden has imposed border controls, and its ultranationalist Sweden Democrats party has grown from the fringe to one of the largest. Many in Germany, Sweden and Austria, which have accepted the lion\xe2\x80\x99s share of refugees so far, want to seal off Greece from the E.U.\xe2\x80\x99s passport-free internal travel zone if Greece \xe2\x80\x94 the first port of entry of many refugees \xe2\x80\x94 is unable or unwilling to hold them.'b'In the past few days, The Guardian reported, national leaders and top E.U. officials 'b'warned'b' \xe2\x80\x9cthat Europe\xe2\x80\x99s passport-free travel zone could crumble within weeks, risking the dissolution of the union.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Chancellor 'b'Angela Merkel'b' of Germany was well intentioned when she opened her country to 1.1 million Arab, African and Afghan migrants last year, but it was also reckless of her to think that so many immigrants, primarily Muslims, could be properly absorbed so quickly into society in Germany \xe2\x80\x94 a country that took two decades and billions of dollars to absorb East Germans. Merkel\xe2\x80\x99s open-door policy drew even more refugees to the E.U., and now that the Germans want to stop the flow, their neighbors won\xe2\x80\x99t take them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis refugee crisis is a real arrow pointed at the heart of the European Union,\xe2\x80\x9d said Miliband. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no solution that confines itself within the borders of Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d As long as there is \xe2\x80\x9cwar without law and without end in Syria,\xe2\x80\x9d the refugee flow will continue, with all its destabilizing implications.'b'Obama did not cause this Syria problem, and he can\xe2\x80\x99t fix it alone \xe2\x80\x94 but it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to get fixed without U.S. leadership. I have shared the president\xe2\x80\x99s caution about getting involved on the ground in Syria. But I now believe we need to take another look at establishing some kind of U.S./E.U./NATO safe zone inside Syria and Libya to create space for refugees to remain in these countries. It\xe2\x80\x99s not a panacea or cost-free, but letting this refugee disaster fracture the E.U. will be a lot more expensive.'b'One after the other, investigations of Planned Parenthood prompted by hidden-camera videos released last summer have found no evidence of wrongdoing. On Monday, a grand jury in Harris County, Tex., went a step further. Though it was convened to investigate Planned Parenthood, it 'b'indicted two members of the group'b' that made the videos instead.'b'The Harris County prosecutor, Devon Anderson, a Republican who was asked by the lieutenant governor, a strident opponent of Planned Parenthood, to open the criminal investigation, said on Monday that the grand jurors had cleared Planned Parenthood of any misconduct.'b'Yet despite all the evidence, Texas\xe2\x80\x99 Republican governor, Greg Abbott, 'b'said on Monday'b' that the state attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s office and the State Health and Human Services Commission would continue investigating Planned Parenthood. This is a purely political campaign of intimidation and persecution meant to destroy an organization whose mission to serve women\xe2\x80\x99s health care needs the governor abhors.'b'Fortunately, in the Harris County case, the jurors considered the facts. David Daleiden, the director of the Center for Medical Progress, which released the videos, and Sandra Merritt, an employee, were indicted on felony charges of tampering with governmental records, probably connected to their alleged use of fake driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses to get into a Planned Parenthood office.'b'Mr. Daleiden was also indicted on a misdemeanor charge of violating a Texas ban on the buying and selling of human organs. A lawyer for Planned Parenthood said Mr. Daleiden sent an email to Planned Parenthood employees last June offering to buy fetal tissue for $1,600 per sample, to which Planned Parenthood never responded. A lawyer for Mr. Daleiden said on Tuesday that his client planned to plead not guilty and would vigorously defend against the charges.'b'Neither the videos nor the many investigations that followed have found any evidence that Planned Parenthood employees offered to sell fetal tissue for a profit. Texas is the 12th state in which investigations stemming from the videos have found no wrongdoing by Planned Parenthood. In October, Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, 'b'admitted'b' that the committee\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of Planned Parenthood had found no evidence of misconduct.'b'Nonetheless, the videos have already had a destructive effect. Texas and several 'b'other states'b' have moved to defund Planned Parenthood; a bill to deny money to the group in Ohio is before the State Senate 'b'this week'b'. A bill that would pull federal money from Planned Parenthood 'b'has reached the president'b', who is sure to veto it.'b'These efforts threaten to deprive the country\xe2\x80\x99s poorest women of health services they need, including cancer screenings, contraceptive care and sexually transmitted infection testing. In many parts of the country, Planned Parenthood is the 'b'only source'b' of contraceptive services for low-income women.'b'Several Republican presidential candidates continue to treat the falsehoods presented by the Center for Medical Progress as fact. In response to Monday\xe2\x80\x99s indictments, Carly Fiorina, for one, 'b'said,'b' \xe2\x80\x9cPlanned Parenthood has been trafficking in body parts,\xe2\x80\x9d a claim she has made repeatedly on the campaign trail.'b'The indictments should cause politicians to back away from an anti-abortion group that will stop at nothing to attack Planned Parenthood. Gov. John Kasich of Ohio is running for president on a platform of good governance and common sense. The campaign against Planned Parenthood is anathema to these principles, and if a bill to defund the organization reaches his desk, he should veto it.'b'If convicted, Mr. Daleiden and Ms. Merritt face up to 20 years in prison on the felony charge; the misdemeanor is punishable by up to a year. These penalties will not undo the damage the videos have already done to Planned Parenthood and women\xe2\x80\x99s health and reproductive rights. State and federal officials who care about the truth should work to remedy that damage in any way they can.'b'THE day after it stopped snowing in New York City last weekend, I took my daughter sledding in Prospect Park. Despite the near record blizzard, things were, remarkably, back to normal in my part of Brooklyn \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to stalwart efforts by city employees. The streets were plowed and salted to glistening blackness. The subway arrived seconds after we did. On Prospect Park\xe2\x80\x99s circular drive, cyclists serenely spun past.'b'There was only one flaw in this picture-postcard image of 'b'spirited urban resilience'b': the sidewalks. The walk to the subway was the most difficult part of our journey. There were the stretches that had not been shoveled (in front of houses under renovation, the perimeter of my neighborhood park) or barely shoveled, forcing walkers into an elaborately pantomimed dance of turn-taking on narrow passageways.'b'Where things got really bad, however, were intersections. Crossing the street meant plunging into slippery, thigh-deep masses of snow piled up by passing plows. Where a few hardy souls had first traversed, there were now single-file crevasses, filled with a melting, exhaust-tinged mire. As my 6-year-old struggled to navigate this urban Tough Mudder course, other pedestrians stacked up behind us, anxiously trying to get out of the street before the light changed and traffic began to rush through again.'b''b'Crossing the street \xe2\x80\x94 even with the walk signal \xe2\x80\x94 is one of the most statistically 'b'hazardous things a New Yorker can do'b'. Asking people to run an icy gantlet compounds this. I can only imagine how much more taxing this is for parents pushing strollers, people in wheelchairs or using walkers, or older pedestrians already struggling with making the light. A curb cut is of little use when covered by a barricade of snow.'b''b'The city\xe2\x80\x99s attitude toward pedestrians seems to be: Let them eat slush. This will only get worse in the coming days as snow melts and refreezes.'b'All this serves as a stark reminder that, even in the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'most walkable large city in America'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (per the website Walk Score), where 'b'households with cars are a minority'b', where any Manhattan intersection will inevitably be more populated by pedestrians than people in cars, people on foot are still routinely neglected \xe2\x80\x94 channeled into spaces that have, in many cases, radically shrunk over the years in favor of wider streets.'b'It is not that the city is unaware of the issue. As 'b'a report issued under the previous administration'b' suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cSystems for clearing heavy snowfall quickly and efficiently should be in place so that pedestrians can continue to use the sidewalk without having to trudge through muddy snow or risk their lives on black ice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A good deal of the problem is that Americans typically do not think of sidewalks as a means of transportation \xe2\x80\x94 as 'b'infrastructure'b'. When news of the blizzard began to blanket the airwaves, there were images of plows hitting the streets, snowbound stretches of highways, or planes idling on tarmac. When Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a \xe2\x80\x9ctravel ban,\xe2\x80\x9d many New Yorkers might have been temporarily puzzled: Does that mean I can\xe2\x80\x99t go down to the corner for a bagel?'b'Sidewalks occupy a curious place in the American city. As the scholar Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris has noted, in 19th-century cities the maintenance of sidewalks was assigned to abutting homeowners because they were presumed to benefit the most from these newly built amenities. And yet, in most jurisdictions, municipalities have had a shared responsibility (particularly in slip-and-fall lawsuits, although this liability in New York was shifted to property owners in 2003).'b'So even though the sidewalk is, in practice, a public space that almost every New Yorker will use in the course of a day, it is treated instead as a piecemeal extension to private property. (As a thought experiment, imagine if property owners had to shovel not just their sidewalks, but the street in front of their buildings, too.) And there is that curious no man\xe2\x80\x99s land at street crossings, a legal limbo beyond the reach of the shovels of the corner bodega or bank, and buried by the snow pushed aside by rumbling city plows.'b'As I struggled to cross the street with my daughter, I dreamed of heated crosswalks (like the 'b'radiant sidewalks'b' luxury apartments now boast) powered by surplus Con Edison steam. A simpler, more practical solution, which would also improve pedestrian safety more generally, is to \xe2\x80\x9cdaylight\xe2\x80\x9d intersections \xe2\x80\x94 not allowing cars to park within a certain distance of the crosswalk. This not only would improve visibility, it would also provide a handy place for plows to shove snow that has accumulated at intersections.'b'In the wake of the storm, the city began hiring temporary \xe2\x80\x9c'b'snow laborers'b'\xe2\x80\x9d to shovel out hydrants, crosswalks and other spaces. This itself smacks of haphazard catch-up, a game other cities don\xe2\x80\x99t play. 'b'Rochester'b', for instance, plows the sidewalks after storms that drop more than four inches of snow; 'b'Montreal'b' starts doing it after one inch. Even car-oriented places like the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights has sidewalk-specific 'b'Bombardier snow removal machines'b'. New York City, the country\xe2\x80\x99s capital of pedestrianism, can do better.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Democratic Race Will Test Where the Left Stands'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 25):'b'The race will not test \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the left stands,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather whether Democrats with an assortment of political views have finally had enough of their own \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment,\xe2\x80\x9d as clearly represented by Hillary Clinton.

But the frustrations of today\xe2\x80\x99s would-be Biafrans are no different from those of their neighbors in the Niger Delta, whose oil keeps Nigeria going but gets them little in return, apart from gas fires and 'b'oil spills'b'. Nor do they differ from the grievances of their fellow countrymen in the north, who continue to wallow in levels of illiteracy and poverty that make the south seem prosperous in comparison.'b'The reality is that no part of Nigeria has a monopoly on victimhood. The impulse to protest suffering and to seek to determine one\xe2\x80\x99s destiny is not wrongheaded; the problem lies in seeking change in a manner that incites ethnic hatred and violence. It would be better for Biafran separatists to drop their calls for independence and push instead for constitutional change that would strengthen the federal system Nigeria purports to practice. Our current Constitution, like the others that followed independence from Britain in 1960, is the product of military leaders whose agenda has rarely coincided with the public good. Though it opens with the requisite words (\xe2\x80\x9cWe the people of the Federal Republic of Nigeria ... \xe2\x80\x9d), it was crafted by a handpicked committee and not made public until the military transferred power to the civilian government on May 29, 1999.'b'Igbo separatists would also do better to follow the example of Scotland and push for a referendum to decide the future of the region. Admittedly, the central government would be unlikely to endorse such a call for fear that it might trigger an avalanche of referendum requests in this country of more than 250 ethnic groups. But were one to take place, my guess is that it would turn out overwhelmingly in favor of preserving union with Nigeria.'b'There will never be enough support in the southeast for independence from Nigeria, mainly because most of the people there realize that there would be little to gain and much to lose. It\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that the delta\xe2\x80\x99s several minority ethnic groups share the conviction of the Biafran agitators that the oil-rich delta states are a natural part of Biafra. Without the Niger delta, Biafra would be a tiny, landlocked nation, its enterprising people hobbled by a requirement to obtain visas to do business in places where they\xe2\x80\x99ve lived and traded in for decades.'b'Moreover, an independent Biafra would remain riven along the very tribal and religious lines that are being invoked to justify its leaving Nigeria. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy for the Igbo to regard themselves as a cultural and religious monolith as long as they remain in Nigeria. But all Nigerians should know that there is no end to subdividing ourselves, once we give in to the impulse. In an independent, overwhelmingly Christian Biafra, people would begin to identify themselves as Anglicans and Catholics and Methodists \xe2\x80\x94 as they already sometimes do in local politics. In the run-up to last year\xe2\x80\x99s elections, for example, Anglican bishops warned the ruling party in the Igbo state of Enugu that they would not accept a gubernatorial ticket composed entirely of Catholic candidates. The party disregarded the warning.'b'The clamor for a referendum would provide a great opportunity for those like me who believe (to take a phrase from British opponents of Scottish independence) that Nigeria would be \xe2\x80\x9cBetter Together.\xe2\x80\x9d Admittedly it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to see this in a country where online comments routinely degenerate into ethnic sniping, but in fact Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s diversity could, with proper framing, be turned into a unifying motif.'b'That \xe2\x80\x9cBetter Together\xe2\x80\x9d campaign would require much soul searching about our country\xe2\x80\x99s painful past. It would also involve recognizing the complaints of the many Igbo voices who are weary of marginalization but do not support the idea of secession.'b'Almost every day since Mr. Kanu\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, there have been protests and calls for the government to free him. In handling his case, the government needs to tread carefully, ensuring that it does not transform him into a cause c\xc3\xa9l\xc3\xa8bre.'b'A few weeks ago, Nigerian newspapers reported the existence of a handwritten statement Mr. Kanu submitted to law enforcement agents shortly after his arrest, in which he apologized \xe2\x80\x9cunreservedly\xe2\x80\x9d for the \xe2\x80\x9cregrettable\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cuncomplimentary things\xe2\x80\x9d he had said about President Buhari and some other people. The government should consider capitalizing on this hint of remorse and making an offer of amnesty to Mr. Kanu in exchange for a pledge to be less-disruptive in his approach.'b'The best way for the government to permanently sideline those who call for political violence is to push for the economic reforms that President Buhari has vowed to accomplish. Tackling corruption and ensuring more equitable distribution of Nigeria\xe2\x80\x99s wealth will benefit all its people. Splintering the country into a hodgepodge of independent states will not.'b'Back in 2000, George W. Bush did something fascinating: On the campaign trail he preached \xe2\x80\x9ccompassionate conservatism,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'telling wealthy Republicans'b' about the travails of Mexican-American immigrants and declaring to women in pearls that \xe2\x80\x9cthe hardest job in America\xe2\x80\x9d is that of a single mother.'b'Those well-heeled audiences looked baffled, but applauded.'b'That instinct to show a little heart helped elect Bush but then largely disappeared from Republican playbooks and policy. Yet now, amid the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s civil war, there are intriguing initiatives by the House speaker, Paul Ryan, and some other conservatives to revive an interest in the needy.'b'Liberals like myself may be tempted to dismiss these new efforts as mere marketing gestures, meant to whitewash what one of the initiatives acknowledges is \xe2\x80\x9cthe longstanding view of a meanspirited conservatism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maybe the liberal skeptics will be proved right. But we should still all root for these efforts, because ultimately whether the poor get help may depend less on Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders than on Republicans at every level. Whether Medicaid is expanded, whether we get high-quality pre-K, whether we tackle addiction, family planning and job training, whether lead continues to poison American children \xe2\x80\x94 all these will depend mostly on Republicans who control Congress and most states.'b'Moreover, Democrats are too quick to assume that they have a monopoly on compassion. President Bush, for example, didn\xe2\x80\x99t govern nearly as compassionately as he campaigned. Yet his program against AIDS 'b'saved millions of lives'b'. He did a 'b'stellar job battling malaria'b' and pressing the fight against sex trafficking.'b'This will be even harder for Democrats to accept, but Republicans have also sometimes been proved right on poverty issues. They were right that the best way to spell aid is often j-o-b. They were right on the importance of strong two-parent families: We now know that children in single-mother families are five times as likely to 'b'live in poverty'b' as those in married households.'b'So I\xe2\x80\x99d be thrilled if Republicans participated in debates about poverty, rather than forfeited the terrain. A real debate would also elevate issues that now are largely neglected, and it would create an opening to hold politicians\xe2\x80\x99 feet to the fire: If Ryan cares, then why did he try to 'b'slash budgets'b' for evidence-based programs that help children?'b'One of the new initiatives is \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Challenging the Caricature'b',\xe2\x80\x9d based on a document that will be presented at an event at Stanford\xe2\x80\x99s Hoover Institution next week. Written by Michael Horowitz, Michael Novak, John O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan, Mona Charen, Linda Chavez and other prominent conservatives, it calls on the right to tackle human rights issues so as to shatter \xe2\x80\x9cthe caricatures that define conservatives as uncaring.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur values are regarded by millions of Americans as inconsistent with theirs and with America\xe2\x80\x99s inherent decency,\xe2\x80\x9d the document warns.'b'Ryan 'b'moderated a forum'b' this month on poverty that drew six Republican presidential hopefuls and tried to frame a G.O.P. perspective on the issue. \xe2\x80\x9cWe now have a safety net that is designed to catch people falling into poverty,\xe2\x80\x9d Ryan said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen what we really need is a safety net that is designed to help get people out of poverty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One reason for skepticism that any of this will get traction: Among the candidates who skipped the forum were the front-runners, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Neither seems interested in this arena.'b'A final initiative is 'b'an excellent plan'b' to reduce poverty put together by a team from the conservative American Enterprise Institute and the liberal Brookings Institution. The report pushes work requirements for government benefits, but also a modest rise in the minimum wage. Instead of increasing public funds for higher education, it suggests taking financial assistance that now goes to higher-income families and redirecting it to the neediest.'b'This report emphasizes that one way to bridge the political divide is to focus on evidence. We now have robust results showing that vocational programs like career academies help disadvantaged young people get jobs and raise their marriage rates. 'b'Parent-coaching programs'b' improve disadvantaged children\xe2\x80\x99s outcomes so much that they save public money.'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a liberal, you may be rolling your eyes. You\xe2\x80\x99re sure that Republicans are just layering compassion camouflage over policies meant to benefit billionaires. Sure, be skeptical. But at least now there can be a debate about how to help, about what the evidence says, about whether Ryan and others act the way they speak.'b'The parties see each other as the root of all evil. But when they have cooperated on humanitarian efforts, real progress has been made: on 'b'AIDS'b', on 'b'prison rape'b', on the earned-income tax credit.'b'The sad truth is that 'b'neither party has done enough'b' to address the shame of deep-rooted poverty in America. So let\xe2\x80\x99s hope for a real contest in this area, because everybody loses \xe2\x80\x94 above all, America\xe2\x80\x99s neediest \xe2\x80\x94 when most of the time one party doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even bother to show up.'b'Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'presidential town hall'b' provided the best format and platform yet for the Democratic candidates. Each was able to play to his or her strengths without the back-and-forth conflict-baiting that debate moderators seem to demand.'b'Even so, Hillary Clinton stood out.'b'Not only did she seem completely at ease in this environment, but she was also confident and wide-ranging in her answers, delivering many in an assertive tone that was one tick below yelling, and displaying a depth and breadth of knowledge that few can match.'b'She was at the top of her game.'b'She had to be. Senator Bernie Sanders is breathing down her neck in Iowa with a message that\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly popular among dissatisfied liberals and that she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been able to counter sufficiently. Furthermore, at the previous debate, she made a huge tactical error by attacking Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s motives and integrity, a move that made her appear smaller, desperate and hostile.'b'At the town hall, Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s back was against the wall, and she performed brilliantly. Indeed, that seems to be when she gives her best performances \xe2\x80\x94 when her back is against the wall. But she is often in that position because of her own doing, her own lapses in judgment, her own miscalculations.'b'It is an odd, cyclical exercise to continue to praise her for climbing out of holes she digs for herself. There almost seems to be a self-destructive, self-defeating impulse at play, a need to be perpetually down so that she can perpetually fight her way back up, a sort of crisis dependency.'b'It is hard to see how this seesawing can produce a winning campaign or a successful presidency, should she win it. She\xe2\x80\x99s going to have to stay at or near the top of her game for the duration.'b'Then there is the strange reality that the ritual of her fighting her way back, even with strong showings like Monday\xe2\x80\x99s, can take on air of disingenuousness in and of itself.'b'The cynical read is that these command performances are calculated, the maneuvering of a purely political being with a gift for guile.'b'That assessment isn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly fair, but it is quite real. I believe it happens in part because there can be an animatronic plasticity present in her comportment and conveyance that raises questions of ambition versus authenticity. She is hands down the most broadly qualified and experienced among the candidates. But there remains an intangible quality that eludes her: connectivity. Even many people who admire her simply don\xe2\x80\x99t trust her.'b'This is the same problem that, to varying degrees, Mitt Romney, Al Gore and Bob Dole had. It\xe2\x80\x99s not fixable. Indeed, attempts to fix it feel even more forced and phony.'b'Another part of this problem stems from something far more tangible: the taint of scandal that has trailed her and her husband much of their lives.'b'One of the questions she got Monday night cut to the quick of this issue for her.'b'A young man rose and asked the following:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like there is a lot of young people like myself who are very passionate supporters of Bernie Sanders. And I just don\xe2\x80\x99t see the same enthusiasm from younger people for you. In fact, I\xe2\x80\x99ve heard from quite a few people my age that they think you\xe2\x80\x99re dishonest, but I\xe2\x80\x99d like to hear from you on why you feel the enthusiasm isn\xe2\x80\x99t there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These are Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s biggest weaknesses: people\xe2\x80\x99s sense of her trustworthiness, and the relative lack of excitement she engenders, particularly among young voters.'b'Perceptions of honesty and trustworthiness are bad and getting worse, even among Democrats. 'b'According to an ABC News/Washington Post poll'b' released Wednesday, among Democrats and independents leaning that way:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSanders now leads by 12 points, 48-36 percent, in being seen as more honest and trustworthy, vs. 6 points last month and an even split in October.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then there is Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s mounting younger-voter problem.'b'According to a 'b'USA TODAY/Rock the Vote poll'b' conducted this month, Sanders leads Clinton among millennial Democrats and independents (those age 18 to 34) 46 percent to 35 percent. Among millennial Democratic and independent women, Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s lead in the poll was 'b'even greater'b': 50 percent to Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s 31 percent. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s strength, and Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s weakness, is mostly driven by the youngest millennials. According to the paper:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAmong both genders, Sanders has 57 percent backing in the 18-25 age group, according to the USA Today/Rock the Vote poll. That drops to 36 percent for those ages 26-34. For Clinton, the opposite is true. She gets 44 percent of those ages 26 to 34 and 25 percent of those 18-25.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sanders has become the cool uncle and Clinton has become the cold aunt.'b'Although many of Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s plans appear on their face to be unworkable and, if they were workable, would cause a massive, possibly unprecedented, expansion of government in this country, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think young people think about it that way. I believe that many of them see Sanders as someone committed to dismantling a broken system and its component broken institutions \xe2\x80\x94 financial, political and educational.'b'Millennials are 'b'notoriously distrusting of institutions'b'. Sanders is anti-institution. The Clintons 'b'are'b' an institution.'b'Clinton answered the question at the town hall mostly by evading it, and turning her attention to the constant in her life: her enemies and their attacks on her. She said at one point:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, look, I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around a long time. People have thrown all kinds of things at me. And you know I can\xe2\x80\x99t keep up with it. I just keep going forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Survival doesn\xe2\x80\x99t excite, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not proof of moral rectitude. But it is evidence of a certain kind of I-will-survive resilience and an I-know-'b'how'b'-to-survive savvy.'b'And that informs the choice Democrats have to make in choosing a nominee: Do they want to put forth a survivor in chief, of whom many are suspicious and about whom few are truly excited, or a dreamer in chief (in the candidacy of Sanders) who says all the things they want to hear but that they quietly know he\xe2\x80\x99ll never be able to deliver?'b'The Democratic presidential race hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been getting as much attention as the Republican side. This is for the same reason that professional wrestling gets more viewers than \xe2\x80\x9cBook TV.\xe2\x80\x9d There\xe2\x80\x99s something compelling about a lot of grunting and body slams.'b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s get focused. Time to discuss how Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton differ on the issues.'b''b'You forgot to mention Martin O\xe2\x80\x99Malley.'b''b'No, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'About Clinton and Sanders. Their positions on most things are similar. They both favor universal prekindergarten and support gay marriage, reproductive rights and a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. They both want to raise the minimum wage, but Sanders is shooting for $15 while Clinton says $12. They both have ambitious plans to fight climate change. Clinton wants to see more than half a billion solar panels in operation by 2020; Sanders has called for 10 million.'b''b'Ha! Who\xe2\x80\x99s the transformational thinker there, Bernie?'b''b'Well, his campaign says it meant solar 'b'roofs. 'b'The more important point is that Sanders also wants a major tax on businesses that keep using fossil fuels. As we go along here, you will note that his proposals are almost all much bolder and that practically everything on his shopping list includes new or higher taxes on somebody. Occasionally everybody, although Sanders would argue that the little people will get their money back through things like free health care and generous family leave policies.'b''b' Clinton doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to raise taxes?'b''b'Some, but mainly on the superrich. Nothing on couples making less than $250,000.'b''b' I vote the person, not the platform. Who would I like more?'b''b'You\xe2\x80\x99d like them both. These are politicians. They spend their lives trying to please people. You don\xe2\x80\x99t get to this level if nobody can stand being around you. Unless, of course, you\xe2\x80\x99re Ted Cruz.'b''b' Do you think Sanders has so many young supporters because he\xe2\x80\x99s transformational or because he wants to make college free?'b''b'That\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a big applause line. This is another good way of looking at the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 differences. Sanders has a sweeping plan: free tuition at public colleges and universities, period. Clinton has a similar goal, but her plan is more complicated because she wants to screen out kids whose parents could afford to pay the freight themselves.'b'So his is easier to understand, while she avoids the problem of having to explain in the final election why the taxpayers should be underwriting chemistry class for Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s grandchildren.'b''b'Are you going to talk about Wall Street? Preferably briefly. Without mentioning the repeal of Glass-Steagall. 'b''b'Very, very basically, Bernie Sanders has a dramatic plan to regulate the big banks, tax the speculators and punish Wall Street evildoers. Clinton would argue that the banks have been pretty well taken care of by the Dodd-Frank law and that what you really need to do is focus on the hedge funds. This is so oversimplified, I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of ashamed. Maybe we should go back and \xe2\x80\xa6'b''b' That\xe2\x80\x99s plenty. Really! So Clinton isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the pocket of big special interests who paid her millions of dollars to give speeches?'b''b'Many people think her Wall Street reform plan is O.K. But on a personal level, it was inexcusable of her to give those $200,000 speeches for investment bankers and the like when she knew she was going to be running for president. Not good at all.'b''b' You\xe2\x80\x99d better say something positive about Hillary Clinton now or I\xe2\x80\x99m going to call this quits.'b''b'She\xe2\x80\x99s stupendously smart. She has a lifetime record of fighting for good causes, particularly children and women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. She would almost certainly be a lot better at working with Congress than President Obama has been.'b''b'What about a President Sanders? Could he actually do any of the stuff he\xe2\x80\x99s talking about?'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine getting Congress to upgrade Obamacare to a single-payer system \xe2\x80\x94 what he describes as Medicare for all. You remember what an enormous lift it was to get any health care reform at all passed. But Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s theory is that by electing him, the people will be sending a message so strong even Congress can\xe2\x80\x99t ignore it.'b''b'Wow, do you think that could happen?'b''b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line of the whole contest. Vote for Bernie: Send a message. Vote for Hillary: She knows how to make things work.'b''b'I would like to elect someone who can make things work while simultaneously sending a message.'b''b'Do you ever watch those house-hunting shows where people make the list of what they want in their next home, and it\xe2\x80\x99s always a place in the heart of the city that\xe2\x80\x99s quiet and has green space for the dog and four bedrooms so guests can come visit, for no more than $500 a month?'b''b'You\xe2\x80\x99re saying I can\xe2\x80\x99t have everything.'b''b'Hey, wait until I ask you to choose between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.'b'No sooner was the Ebola virus subdued in Africa than another virus, Zika, began sweeping through South and Central America. It has been linked to 'b'serious birth defects'b' and is threatening to invade the United States. It is imperative that the World Health Organization not repeat its sluggish response to the Ebola crisis and act urgently this time to mobilize international action.'b'Until it reached the Western Hemisphere, the Zika virus \xe2\x80\x94 related to dengue, yellow fever and West Nile virus and named after the Ugandan forest where it was first identified almost 70 years ago \xe2\x80\x94 had caused little more than relatively mild, flulike infections. But in the nine months since it came to the Americas, it has moved swiftly through Brazil and two dozen other countries and territories, spread by mosquitoes of the Aedes species, which can breed in the tiniest pools of water and usually bite during the day, making them especially hard to control.'b'Though not particularly dangerous to the person infected, the spread of Zika has been accompanied by a huge spike in microcephaly, a congenital and irreversible deformation of the skull in newborn babies. The number of reported cases in Brazil jumped from 147 in 2014 to nearly 4,000 in 2015, leaving health officials with little doubt \xe2\x80\x94 although no firm scientific proof \xe2\x80\x94 that Zika was responsible. Scientists have also identified a possible link between the virus and the neurological disorder known as the Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 syndrome.'b'At present there is no vaccine, no cure and no widely available test for Zika infection. In their absence, the obvious course is to avoid mosquito bites by wearing clothes that cover arms and legs, and using air-conditioning and screens and insect repellents containing DEET. Brazil, which is hosting the Olympic Games this summer, has begun an extensive 'b'campaign'b' to eradicate mosquitoes, including the deployment of 220,000 soldiers to search for breeding sites, and has urged women to avoid getting pregnant until the outbreak is brought under control.'b'El Salvador 'b'has advised'b' women to delay pregnancy until 2018. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 'b'has issued'b' a list of countries pregnant women would be wise to avoid and has urged pregnant women who have traveled to affected areas to see a doctor and determine whether a test is required. None of that is likely to quickly end the scourge, and no country can do that on its own. On the contrary, the virus could migrate to southern areas of the United States when winter ends.'b'Regrettably, despite these actions, the World Health Organization seems, once again, to be dozing and has yet to generate a broad and coordinated international response. By coincidence, the W.H.O. executive board is currently meeting in Geneva, so this is the perfect time for the agency to show leadership by convening an emergency committee of experts to take stock of the Zika pandemic and advise the W.H.O. director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, on how best to combat it.'b''b''b'Update:'b' After publication, the World Health Organization 'b'announced Thursday'b' it would convene an emergency meeting on Monday to decide whether to declare a public health emergency due to the spread of the Zika virus.'b''b'Late in October, when it was still possible to envision a somewhat normal Republican primary season, 'b'Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush had a moment'b' on the debate stage that seemed as if it might be a turning point in the campaign.'b'Bush, the well-funded front-runner whose 'b'poll numbers had been sliding'b' since the summer, came prepared to swing at Rubio over his missed votes in the Senate. Rubio, the upstart running against his former mentor, responded with a mix of grace and pity, dismissing Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s attack as a desperate flail, taken because \xe2\x80\x9csomeone has convinced you that attacking me is going to help you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the month after that confrontation, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s national numbers slipped into the lower single digits, while Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s climbed steadily. In early December, he and Ted Cruz both had about 15 percent support in the national polls, below Donald Trump but well above all the other professional politicians in the race. It seemed as if they were rising in tandem, and that Rubio was destined to be the establishment\xe2\x80\x99s preferred candidate in a three-man race with Cruz and Trump \xe2\x80\x94 and based on past results, the 'b'likely nominee'b'.'b'But instead, Rubio hit a ceiling, while Cruz continued to climb. And despite a long series of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'moments'b'\xe2\x80\x9d when he was supposed to consolidate his position, the Florida senator is still basically stuck. He\xe2\x80\x99s hovering just above 10 percent in national polls and in New Hampshire, trailing Cruz and Trump by a clear margin in Iowa, and still lagging Jeb in 'b'the endorsement primary'b'.'b'Nobody\xe2\x80\x99s sure why. Rubio has various weaknesses, but he\xe2\x80\x99s well liked by Republican voters, he 'b'polls very well against Hillary Clinton'b', and nothing scandalous has emerged to derail him. Yet here we are just days from Iowa, and prominent Republicans are variously frustrated and confused, resigning themselves to Trump-versus-Cruz or attempting complicated bank shots to take one or both of them out \xe2\x80\xa6 instead of doing what many people expected and simply rallying to Rubio.'b'Here are some possible explanations:'b''b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s all about immigration. 'b''b'In a race dominated by Trumpian nationalism, and with immigration restriction 'b'increasingly a litmus test'b' for many conservative voters, Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s role in the \xe2\x80\x9cGang of Eight\xe2\x80\x9d immigration bill is plainly a liability. Possibly enough of a liability, in fact, to deny him the nomination.'b'At the same time, though, there are still lots of Republican voters who don\xe2\x80\x99t consider the immigration issue a top priority, and lots of Republican donors and elected officials for whom Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cGang of Eight\xe2\x80\x9d support is probably an asset. So immigration might explain why he trails Trump and Cruz in Iowa, but not why he can\xe2\x80\x99t put away Jeb, Chris Christie and 'b'John Kasich'b'.'b''b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s all Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s fault. 'b''b'This is the narrative advanced by many of Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s supporters, and 'b'not only them'b'. In effect, they argue, Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s campaign has become an anti-Rubio zombie operation. Even as Bush\xe2\x80\x99s own numbers have remained stagnant, his \xe2\x80\x9csuper PAC,\xe2\x80\x9d Right to Rise, has spent a fortune on anti-Rubio attack ads. In so doing, 'b'The Weekly Standard\xe2\x80\x99s Stephen Hayes argues'b', Team Bush is effectively running a suicide mission against Rubio, whose only \xe2\x80\x9clasting legacy\xe2\x80\x9d will be \xe2\x80\x9cits prominent role in making Donald Trump the nominee.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This seems a little harsh (and not only because I still don\xe2\x80\x99t think Trump will be the nominee). A candidacy that can\xe2\x80\x99t survive a run of attack ads isn\xe2\x80\x99t a candidacy destined for glory. Rubio has done less than Jeb to take the fight to Trump. And Jeb is about even with his former prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 in New Hampshire polling now, so it\xe2\x80\x99s not clear that he\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'just'b' a zombie at this point.'b'Still, the Right to Rise onslaught is a decent explanation for Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s stagnation. But not a complete one, since it\xe2\x80\x99s not as though Jeb actually controls the entire Republican establishment. If his donors were really unhappy with his strategy they could desert en masse to Rubio; if leading Republican politicians felt certain Rubio was the better bet, they could counter Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s ads with a wave of endorsements. But they haven\xe2\x80\x99t, again despite Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s higher favorables and better general election odds. Which raises the possibility that \xe2\x80\xa6'b''b''b'Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s a little too conservative. 'b''b'Both the Republican donor class and the New Hampshire electorate, in slightly different ways, are more moderate or even liberal than the wider Republican electorate. Meanwhile, as 'b'Harry Enten of FiveThirtyEight points out'b', Rubio is a lot more conservative than his \xe2\x80\x9cgreat establishment hope\xe2\x80\x9d image currently suggests.'b'Moreover, his conservatism is most pronounced on social issues, which makes him culturally alien to both the libertarian and Yankee moderates of New Hampshire and the secular and socially liberal segment of the party\xe2\x80\x99s donor base.'b'Which is why it isn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily surprising that Rubio is polling slightly better in evangelical-heavy Iowa than in New Hampshire, or that he\xe2\x80\x99s having trouble putting away more moderate figures like Christie and Kasich in the latter state. It may well be, as Enten suggests, that a lot of Republican bigwigs are just much more politically and culturally comfortable with the other candidates in the establishment \xe2\x80\x9clane,\xe2\x80\x9d and so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t ready to throw in with Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s piety and Tea Party-ish voting record until they have no other choice.'b'Then there also might be a more personal element as well \xe2\x80\xa6'b''b''b'Rubio seems a little too ambitious.'b''b' He\xe2\x80\x99s no Ted Cruz, whose naked self-promotion and penchant for making enemies has left him effectively running against the entire institutional party. But as 'b'Matt Yglesias of Vox notes'b', Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s ascent has been marked by repeated acts of rebellion and opportunism \xe2\x80\x94 many of them successful, all of them quite normal for politicians, but condensed into a relatively narrow span of time.'b'The G.O.P.\xe2\x80\x99s history as a royalist party is somewhat exaggerated, but it has repeatedly handed nominations to elder statesmen in years when it seems to be their turn, and the royalist tendency is naturally strongest in the party elite. It may not be only Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle that regards Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s rise as a little swift, and his decision to run as a little premature, even arrogant. There may be a sense that he needs to prove himself with voters, to actually win a caucus or a primary, before he can lay claim to wide support.'b'In the quest for that support, he has one glaring problem \xe2\x80\xa6'b''b''b'Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s strengths might be a bad fit for the 2016 mood. 'b''b'Part of the reason that pundits (myself included) have tended to rate the Florida senator highly as a candidate is that he combines a conservative record with some of the gifts of Bill Clinton circa 1992 and Barack Obama circa 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 eloquence, optimism, a strong personal narrative, a clear interest in domestic policy.'b'But in this election, many Republican voters seem to be 'b'looking for a Richard Nixon'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a hard man for hard times, you might say, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t really a slogan that fits the boyish-looking first term senator.'b'This is why perhaps \xe2\x80\x94 just perhaps \xe2\x80\x94 Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s strategy of avoiding conflicts with Trump has been a strategic error. A young politician can try to project toughness all he likes, but the only way to actually prove your toughness is to fight the battle that\xe2\x80\x99s right in front of you.'b'And for Rubio, sooner rather than too late, that might mean finding a way to fight with Donald Trump and win.'b'The Supreme Court earlier this week 'b'upheld a federal regulation'b' that encourages factories, shopping malls and other users of electricity to reduce their consumption during periods of high demand, like hot summer afternoons. The well-reasoned decision will save consumers money and improve the reliability of the electricity grid.'b'By a 6-to-2 majority, the court ruled in favor of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in a case brought by a group representing power plants. In 2011, the commission issued a rule applying to the wholesale markets that operate in many parts of the country in which electricity production and distribution are divided into separate businesses. In those markets, which are operated by nonprofit entities, power producers like Exelon sell electricity and utilities like Con Edison buy it to distribute energy to homes and businesses.'b'Under the rule, the operators of the wholesale markets are required to pay users of electricity like big stores and factories if they voluntarily agree to cut consumption during peak periods. The commission also created a formula to determine how much those users should be paid. This approach is known as \xe2\x80\x9cdemand response\xe2\x80\x9d and it can reduce the need for power plants to generate more supply on short notice, which is expensive and can strain power lines and cause blackouts.'b'The Electric Power Supply Association, which represents power producers, challenged the rules because its members stand to earn less money if there is an incentive for businesses to use less energy when it is most expensive. The group argued that the commission had authority only to regulate interstate wholesale electricity markets, but that its rule also affected retail prices, which Congress has said should be regulated by states. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the power plants in 2014.'b'The Supreme Court overturned that decision on Monday, rightly concluding that the regulation applies only to wholesale markets. State officials still regulate retail rates and also have the authority to stop electricity users from participating in demand-response programs.'b'Of course, any rule that influences wholesale prices will have an impact on retail prices. In some parts of the country, industry officials and experts say demand response has saved consumers 'b'billions of dollars'b' a year. It would be absurd to use the link between wholesale and retail markets as a reason to strike down a federal rule that helps conserve energy and strengthens the electricity grid.'b'In this decision, like in previous 'b'rulings upholding pollution regulations'b' issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Supreme Court is clearly saying that regulators have broad discretion to enforce federal laws. Their job is not to protect the profits of a segment of an industry. Regulators ought to do what is in the public interest, which is exactly what the energy commission\xe2\x80\x99s rule does.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Trump, in Feud With Network, Shuns Debate'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (front page, Jan. 27):'b'I hope that by boycotting the Fox debate on Thursday, Donald Trump has finally found a way to kill his run for president.

Once again, he\xe2\x80\x99s got the political world buzzing, the pundits pontificating. Once again, the country is waiting for him to decide yea or nay.'b'Why again? Well, why not? This is Mike Bloomberg we are talking about \xe2\x80\x94 a man who has wanted to be president since his college years, when he told friends at Johns Hopkins that he was interested in three jobs: secretary general of the United Nations, head of the World Bank and president of the United States. They never forgot, convinced he was dead serious.'b'The former mayor of New York, 74 next month, always wanted to be his own boss, never wanted to work for anyone else, and has said so outright, whenever his name was floated for a cabinet job or the equivalent. Even in his first job out of graduate school, at Salomon Brothers, he told his bosses he could do a better job of running their company than they could.'b'He did well at Salomon, but by the early 1970s he was impatient. The rare Wall Street trader who understood the nexus between investing and computer technology, Mr. Bloomberg preached change. He said that investors wanted data, news and analytics in real time, and pushed for smaller desktop computers to replace the company\xe2\x80\x99s monster mainframes, accessible only to underpaid researchers. History would prove him right, but his needling won him no friends and he was demoted to the information-technology department.'b'Stuck in what was then Siberia, he was tempted to quit, but stayed and burnished his technical knowledge until he was dismissed a few years later following a merger. He used some of his $10 million golden parachute to start his own company \xe2\x80\x94 and so the Bloomberg empire was born. That nascent company would create the wildly successful Bloomberg terminal, the data-rich phenomenon that the pesky Salomon trader had envisioned.'b'Mr. Bloomberg never looked back. He has, from then on, always been his own boss, has always run his own thing. And why, he has to be asking himself, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t that thing now be the United States of America?'b'During the 2008 presidential campaign, he told friends and advisers he was sure he could do a better job than Barack Obama, the freshman Democratic senator from Illinois, or Senator John McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee. One of his political advisers talked about \xe2\x80\x9ca billion-dollar campaign\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the same figure bandied about now.'b'He wanted to run in that race. The mayor even flew to the University of Oklahoma that winter to participate in a conference on bipartisanship with political figures like the former Democratic senator Gary Hart. Mr. Bloomberg was a headliner at the event, but a few days earlier, Mr. Obama pulled an upset victory in the Iowa caucuses, and the attention moved away from Oklahoma.'b'Seeing no way to win, Mr. Bloomberg did not run in 2008. He again mulled, then decided against, an independent run in the 2012 election. Though hugely ambitious, he is also deliberative and risk averse. He is careful, calculating, protective of his reputation and his privacy.'b'He also hates to lose, and does everything he can to make sure he does not. He first considered running for mayor four years before the election, and prepared intensively for two years. He\xe2\x80\x99d never run for office but, bored with making money and intrigued with the notion of managing a city, he hired advisers, debriefed former mayors, visited neighborhoods, took polls. Helped mightily by his wealth (he spent $74 million), the city\xe2\x80\x99s desire for strong business leadership after the Sept. 11 attacks and Democratic Party infighting \xe2\x80\x94 he ran as a Republican \xe2\x80\x94 the billionaire from Medford, Mass., took New York\xe2\x80\x99s City Hall.'b'Could the improbable happen again? The presidential lineup today is unusually tempting for Mr. Bloomberg, the sensible centrist. As he looks at the candidates, he sees a threat to the country in the ignorance of Donald J. Trump, the rigidity of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the extremism of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He is watching Hillary Clinton, too, in case her campaign craters.'b'Is there an unorthodox path for him to the White House in this odd political season? He surely sees hunger in the country for middle-of-the-road politics and policies. There is no question that many voters favor an approach that combines fiscal prudence and social tolerance. His wealth cuts both ways with most voters: It guarantees his independence, a plus; but it shouts Wall Street, a minus.'b'Mr. Bloomberg knows the persona he projects: He is uncharismatic. He is not good on the stump. He can be cranky, impatient with emotion, stiff. He is also a New Yorker and Jewish, fiercely anti-gun, pro-choice, pro-immigrant, pro-Wall Street, even anti-soda. He was a leader in the fight for 'b'same-sex marriage'b' in New York, he believes in climate change, he will not talk about his faith or lack of same.'b'How many Republicans and Democrats would defect to support this willful child of Wall Street? How many independents? Could Mr. Bloomberg, ardent defender of his administration\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'stop-and-frisk'b' policing policy, count on significant support from black voters? Would his maneuvering to win a third mayoral term undercut his claim to be above back-room politics?'b'He has to reckon, too, with the failed candidacies of every third-party candidate, from Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 to H. Ross Perot in 1992. And, likely to take most votes from the Democrat, he would risk being the spoiler, handing the election to the Republican, as Ralph Nader might have been for Al Gore in 2000.'b'Another possibility: With three candidates in the race, none of them would get a majority in the Electoral College. If that happened, the choice of the president would be thrown into a chaotic House of Representatives.'b'Mr. Bloomberg has to weigh all these possibilities by early March to give him time to qualify for the ballots in all 50 states: a high-risk guessing game on incomplete information.'b'What he will decide is an open question. How he will decide is easier to predict: He will sift through the data, listen to advisers, discount the advice of those more interested in their own futures than his (a common campaign-season affliction). And he will run for the White House only if he can see a plausible path around the obstacles of history and his own political biography.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b'Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Why I Always Wanted to Be a Secretary'b'\xe2\x80\x9d (Sunday Review, Jan. 17):'b'Bryn Greenwood\xe2\x80\x99s essay about how typing affected her career struck a strong response with me because, in the early 1950s, typing kept me out of a foxhole guarding the border with North Korea, which is where most of my fellow soldiers in the Army\xe2\x80\x99s infantry basic training wound up.'b'Because I could type, I was sent to clerical school and spent the last 18 months of my service at Camp Irwin, Calif., typing separation papers for those leaving the Army.

The group\xe2\x80\x99s members have met with the education minister in the hope of shaping education policy; in states that the B.J.P. controls, the R.S.S. has been 'b'putting forward'b' the names of underqualified ideologues for advisory positions on the content of textbooks and curriculums. It has also sought to put those who share its ideology at the head of important cultural institutions, such as the Indian Council of Historical Research.'b'This is the background to Mr. Pandey\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal. His new boss, Girish Chandra Tripathi, the vice chancellor, is an R.S.S. man. The Ministry of Education helped push through his appointment after Mr. Modi\xe2\x80\x99s election. One B.H.U. professor, who wished not to be named, described Mr. Tripathi as \xe2\x80\x9can academic thug with no qualifications.\xe2\x80\x9d (He was previously a professor of economics.)'b'The new vice chancellor soon turned on Mr. Pandey. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was all engineered,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pandey said to me. First, the professor said, he was denounced by a student. Then a local news website printed a bogus story accusing him of being part of an armed guerrilla movement. (Mr. Pandey, a Gandhian, opposes all violence.) Soon after, the technical institute\xe2\x80\x99s board of governors decided, on Mr. Tripathi\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, that he be fired. He is an alumnus of the university and a mechanical engineer with a degree from the University of California, Berkeley. He has won awards for his social work. None of this made a difference. He was given a month to clear out.'b'I thought I should speak to the vice chancellor. He was out of town, but came on the telephone. The mention of \xe2\x80\x9cSandeep Pandey\xe2\x80\x9d was like a trigger. He told me that Mr. Pandey had questioned whether Kashmir was an integral part of India and he had tried to screen the banned documentary \xe2\x80\x9cIndia\xe2\x80\x99s Daughter,\xe2\x80\x9d which deals with the infamous gang rape and murder of Jyoti Singh, a physiotherapy student in New Delhi in 2012.'b'I must not have seemed sufficiently appalled. Mr. Tripathi tried a different tack. He said, on hearing of my connection to an American publication, \xe2\x80\x9cTell me, can you, being a professor in America, criticize the American government?\xe2\x80\x9d Yes, I answered. He tried again. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you,\xe2\x80\x9d he thundered down the line, \xe2\x80\x9cbeing a professor in America, teach what is against America\xe2\x80\x99s interests?\xe2\x80\x9d I remembered a professor at Amherst College, my alma mater, who had once compared George W. Bush to Osama bin Laden. \xe2\x80\x9cProbably,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, maybe you can in America,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with disgust. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you can\xe2\x80\x99t do it in India.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I had one last question. I had seen the vice chancellor recently at a religious event celebrating the university\xe2\x80\x99s centenary, where the presiding pundit had claimed that ancient India possessed the science of gestational surrogacy. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had these technologies, too,\xe2\x80\x9d the pundit said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut over the course of a thousand years of slavery we forgot them. Or, rather, we were made to forget them.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pandey, a man of science, had told me that Mr. Tripathi and his ilk were of the same mind as the pundit and even believed ancient India had possessed aircraft and ballistic missiles.'b'I had to ask. Did the vice chancellor really believe this? \xe2\x80\x9cI still say it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said defensively. I asked him to explain further. He said this was not a conversation to be had on the telephone. He would show me all the evidence later. The line went dead.'b'The problem with the vice chancellor is not just that he is right-wing. It is that he is unqualified for his position. This was never more apparent than in his total inability to grasp the value of dissent at an institution of learning.'b'Mr. Pandey has spent a lifetime working among some of India\xe2\x80\x99s most voiceless people. It was sinister in the extreme that he should be dismissed for being \xe2\x80\x9canti-national.\xe2\x80\x9d And that term is being bandied about far too much by the R.S.S. and its allies these days. The R.S.S.\xe2\x80\x99s student wing at the University of Hyderabad recently smeared a 26-year-old doctoral student from a low-caste background as \xe2\x80\x9canti-national\xe2\x80\x9d for his activism. The university decided to ban him from all public spaces. Earlier this month he committed suicide.'b'The R.S.S. has always been more of a liability for Mr. Modi than an asset. The organization has been waiting to introduce its radical agenda on the cultural and academic landscape in place of the Modi government\xe2\x80\x99s promise of development. If Mr. Modi gives them an opening, they will bury him. They will reduce his broad mandate to the hysteria of a few. And, in the bargain, they will do immeasurable harm to the capacious idea of what it means to be Indian.'b'TAIPEI, Taiwan \xe2\x80\x94 On a drizzly Tuesday night earlier this month, Chen Li-hung, a celebrity news television host, strode onto a stage in Changhua, in central 'b'Taiwan'b', and launched into a passionate speech, feeding red meat to his Democratic Progressive Party\xe2\x80\x99s assembled faithful.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy parents are from mainland 'b'China'b',\xe2\x80\x9d he told the crowd. \xe2\x80\x9cYet I was born in Taiwan. I grew up in Taiwan. So why did the teachers in school tell me I am still Chinese? Since my youth, I have felt that I am not Chinese, I am Taiwanese!\xe2\x80\x9d He ripped into the incumbent president, Ma Ying-jeou. \xe2\x80\x9cEight years ago, President Ma won himself a pretty nice electoral victory, but he is walking us closer and closer to China, and has Taiwan gotten any better?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For hours, speakers like Mr. Chen raised the crowd to a fever pitch. Then Tsai Ing-wen, the party\xe2\x80\x99s presidential nominee, arrived to cool them down.'b'Ms. Tsai, a former law professor and trade negotiator, let her surrogates fire up the base during the election campaign that ended on Jan. 16 in victory for her and her party. She knew that if voters detected too much populism, they would have turned on her. And she realized that Beijing and Washington watch her words closely.'b'The range in performances between Mr. Chen and Ms. Tsai helps explain the Democratic Progressive Party\xe2\x80\x99s crushing margin of victory two weeks ago over Mr. Ma\xe2\x80\x99s Kuomintang party, which lost both the presidency and, for the first time, Parliament. The rally highlighted why, with this election, China has lost Taiwan for good.'b'When the Kuomintang was defeated in a civil war by Mao\xe2\x80\x99s Communists in 1949, its leadership retreated to Taiwan with millions of mainlander refugees like Mr. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s parents, establishing an independent authoritarian government that gave way to democracy in the 1990s. Since 1949, Beijing has claimed Taiwan as a wayward province that must be reunited with the mainland, peacefully if possible but by force if necessary. The United States is Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s security guarantor, but also wishes to avoid offending Beijing and has been unsympathetic to Taiwanese leaders who rock the boat. Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s voters punish candidates who needlessly provoke China, or alienate Washington.'b'Beijing has pursued a decades-long strategy of patience and economic courtship, hoping that Taiwan would peacefully rejoin the mainland. And the Taiwanese do want stable, functional ties with China. Polls show most Taiwanese favor the status quo of de facto independence, without any official declaration that would enrage Beijing and possibly provoke an invasion.'b'But with the mainland\xe2\x80\x99s economic miracle running aground, many Taiwanese are questioning the wisdom of lashing themselves to the mast. The Taiwanese worry that Mr. Ma\xe2\x80\x99s rapprochement with Beijing has gotten too close, without enough trickle-down benefits to average Taiwanese. A free-trade bill that would have opened sensitive industries, such as media, to mainland Chinese ownership, stalled in Parliament in 2014 amid student protests, which became known as the Sunflower Movement.'b'Meanwhile, the Taiwanese see an increasingly repressive mainland government across the strait \xe2\x80\x94 and want no part of it. President Xi Jinping\xe2\x80\x99s crackdown on dissent and nationalist appeals to the glory of Chinese culture are uncomfortable reminders of Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s own experiences under martial law.'b'But it was the sentiment expressed by Mr. Chen during the rally that suggests why, unless Beijing resorts to force, the China-Taiwan divorce could be permanent. Polls show that the generation of islanders who identify as \xe2\x80\x9cChinese\xe2\x80\x9d is fading, and more people are identifying themselves as \xe2\x80\x9cTaiwanese.\xe2\x80\x9d Decades of de facto independence have whetted Taiwanese appetites for the real thing. Polls show most Taiwanese are unwilling to rejoin even a democratic China.'b'These feelings will deepen as a younger generation of Taiwanese finds its political voice. Indigenous identity and attachment to liberal civic values are strongest among the increasingly assertive youth, whose Sunflower Movement spawned the New Power Party, which in coalition with Ms. Tsai\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic Progressive Party toppled several Kuomintang incumbents in the election.'b'Still, while Taiwanese may increasingly identify with a unique local culture \xe2\x80\x94 and the passion of someone like Mr. Chen \xe2\x80\x94 for now they prefer Ms. Tsai\xe2\x80\x99s more measured public persona. A cerebral technocrat, she is different from the earthier elders in her party, some of whom started their political careers in Kuomintang prisons.'b'Even as Ms. Tsai\xe2\x80\x99s surrogates played the identity card, her campaign stressed economic competence and promised no formal independence, a position meant to avoid offending Beijing and Washington. Yet Ms. Tsai\xe2\x80\x99s party platform still advocates independence, and her victory will give her power to entrench Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s separateness with subtle policy tweaks.'b'The Pacific Rim\xe2\x80\x99s shifting politics may tilt Washington\xe2\x80\x99s calculus as well. Since the Nixon administration, Washington has prioritized a realpolitik relationship with Beijing over any attachment to Taiwan. America\xe2\x80\x99s current stance toward China\xe2\x80\x99s claims on Taiwan is implicit acquiescence. But Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s growing assertiveness along its periphery has raised alarms for American allies in Tokyo, Seoul and Manila, all of whom are watching to see how China tests America\xe2\x80\x99s defense commitments to Taiwan.'b'Ms. Tsai will not miss chances to remind Washington of the importance of that alliance. Her party intends to use its parliamentary majority to navigate Taiwan into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, an agreement that will hedge the island\xe2\x80\x99s economy away from China and bind it more closely to America and its regional allies.'b'As Mr. Chen finished his stemwinder, the finale of Beethoven\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Symphony blasted over the speakers. \xe2\x80\x9cProtect our way of life, uphold our character ... come out to vote!\xe2\x80\x9d he implored. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s give the Democratic Progressive Party a powerful start to its time in office!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s voters have done just that, pushing Beijing\xe2\x80\x99s dream of reunification even further from reach.'b'Just before Christmas, Ron Dermer, 'b'Israel'b'\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the United States, sent the White House 'b'a box of holiday gifts'b' with a pointed political message. Inside were items (body lotion, halvah, olive oil) produced in Jewish settlements in the 'b'West Bank'b'. Or rather, as Mr. Dermer put it in an accompanying letter, in Judea and Samaria \xe2\x80\x94 the term used by religious nationalists who see the settlements as no less a part of Israel than the Galilee or Tel Aviv.'b'From a biblical perspective, this view may be tenable. From a legal and moral perspective, it is not. As documented in a 'b'new report'b' by 'b'Human Rights Watch'b', Israel\xe2\x80\x99s occupation has grown into a lucrative business, exploited by companies as part of a system that is unlawful and abusive.'b'Like the settlers, these enterprises receive benefits from the Israeli government \xe2\x80\x94 preferential access to land and water, low rents \xe2\x80\x94 that make the occupied territories an alluring destination. It is another story for 'b'Palestinians'b', who are routinely denied permits to open their own businesses, cut off from their land and hemmed in by restrictions that, according to the World Bank, 'b'cost the Palestinian economy $3.4 billion a year'b'.'b'All of these businesses are operating on illegally occupied land. A significant amount of land, it turns out. There are roughly 1,000 factories in the chain of Israeli-administered \xe2\x80\x9cindustrial zones\xe2\x80\x9d strung across the West Bank. The geographic footprint of these commercial enterprises, together with shopping centers and agricultural projects, exceeds the built-up areas of settler housing.'b'Some Israeli officials have 'b'argued'b' that Palestinians benefit by working in settlement businesses, producing what one factory owner calls \xe2\x80\x9cgoods of peace.\xe2\x80\x9d But many work in settlements only because Israel\xe2\x80\x99s stifling of the Palestinian economy has deprived them of alternatives. Because the government rarely conducts labor inspections, Palestinian workers often earn less than the Israeli minimum wage. If workers complain, employers sometimes retaliate by fabricating a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity incident\xe2\x80\x9d that will deprive Palestinians of their work permits, according to the H.R.W. report.'b'To view goods made under these conditions as no different than products made within Israel requires going blind to such indignities. Unfortunately, that is exactly what new legislation that will soon land on 'b'President Obama'b'\xe2\x80\x99s desk would require the United States government to do. Under a provision of a 'b'larger piece of legislation,'b' popularly known as the Customs Bill, that has been approved by the House and is expected to soon pass the Senate, American officials will be obligated to treat the settlements as part of Israel in future trade negotiations.'b'The ostensible reason this provision was added to a bill on international trade is to combat the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement, a grass-roots campaign that seeks to pressure Israel to change its policies toward the Palestinians. But under 'b'existing law'b', Washington already forbids American companies to cooperate with state-led boycotts of Israel. Under the guise of an antiboycott provision, the Customs Bill extends similar protections to \xe2\x80\x9cIsraeli-controlled territories\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 meaning settlements. For American trade negotiators, the industrial zones dotting the occupied territories would have the same status as the high-tech industry in Tel Aviv, just as settler zealots insist.'b'This potential, and largely unnoticed, shift in American policy comes just as frustration with the stalled peace process and Israel\xe2\x80\x99s deepening grip on the occupied territories is leading to more targeted pressure on Israel\xe2\x80\x99s settlements. This month, the pension board of the United Methodist Church 'b'decided'b' that five Israeli banks that fund construction in the settlements are ineligible for its investment. In November, the European Union, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s largest trading partner, declared that products made in the occupied territories 'b'should be labeled separately 'b'from Israeli goods.'b'As the H.R.W. report makes clear, these steps are consistent with international law. Since all companies that do business in or with settlements inevitably contribute to human rights violations, they should stop. And since no country recognizes Israeli sovereignty over the occupied territories, all of Israel\xe2\x80\x99s trading partners should insist that the label \xe2\x80\x9cMade in Israel\xe2\x80\x9d be removed from products from the settlements.'b'The Palestinian Authority has described separate labeling of settlement goods as a useful step. (The authority supports boycotting these goods.) Not surprisingly, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu disagrees. In the letter Mr. Dermer sent to the recipients of his holiday gifts, he claimed that the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s push to differentiate settlement products casts Israel as a \xe2\x80\x9cpariah state.\xe2\x80\x9d He neglected to mention the 'b'petition'b' signed by over 550 prominent Israelis that welcomed the union\xe2\x80\x99s decision and called on other nations to follow suit. Among the signatories was Avishai Margalit, a former recipient of the Israel Prize in philosophy, and Avraham Burg, a former speaker of the Israeli Knesset.'b'The Obama administration has made it clear that it does not accept the conflation of the settlements and Israel. When the Customs Bill reaches his desk, Mr. Obama may take the rare step of issuing a signing statement objecting to its pro-settlement language. But if this provision becomes law, it will be a major victory for the Israeli right, albeit one that it may come to regret. The more the line between Israel and the occupied territories is blurred, the more likely the rest of the world will be to question the legitimacy of not just the settlements but Israel itself. In the long run, this will not prevent Israel from being depicted as a pariah state, but instead will provide powerful ammunition to those who see it as such.'b'Pay as you go: This country is no place for freeloaders.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 WHILE presidential candidates from both parties feverishly pitch their legislative agendas, voters should also consider what presidents can do without Congress. Agency rules, executive actions and decisions about how vigorously to enforce certain laws will have an impact on every American, without a single new bill introduced in Congress.'b'The Obama administration has a substantial track record on agency rules and executive actions. It has used these tools to protect retirement savings, expand overtime pay, prohibit discrimination against L.G.B.T. employees who work for the government and federal contractors, and rein in carbon pollution. These accomplishments matter.'b'Whether the next president will build on them, or reverse them, is a central issue in the 2016 election. But the administration\xe2\x80\x99s record on enforcement falls short \xe2\x80\x94 and federal enforcement of laws that already exist has received far too little attention on the campaign trail.'b'I just 'b'released a report'b' examining 20 of the worst federal enforcement failures in 2015. Its conclusion: \xe2\x80\x9cCorporate criminals routinely escape meaningful prosecution for their misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a single year, in case after case, across many sectors of the economy, federal agencies caught big companies breaking the law \xe2\x80\x94 defrauding taxpayers, covering up deadly safety problems, even precipitating the financial collapse in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 and let them off the hook with barely a slap on the wrist. Often, companies paid meager fines, which some will try to write off as a tax deduction.'b'The failure to adequately punish big corporations or their executives when they break the law undermines the foundations of this great country. Justice cannot mean a prison sentence for a teenager who steals a car, but nothing more than a sideways glance at a C.E.O. who quietly engineers the theft of billions of dollars.'b'These enforcement failures demean our principles. They also represent missed opportunities to address some of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most pressing challenges. Consider just two areas \xe2\x80\x94 college affordability and health care \xe2\x80\x94 where robust enforcement of current law could help millions of people.'b'When the Education Management Corporation, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest for-profit college, signed up tens of thousands of students by lying about its programs, it saddled them with fraudulent degrees and huge debts. Those debts wrecked lives. Under the law, the government can bar such institutions from receiving more federal student loans. But EDMC just paid a fine and kept right on raking in federal loan money.'b'When Novartis, a major drug company that was already effectively on federal probation for misconduct, paid kickbacks to pharmacies to push certain drugs, it cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and undermined patient health. Under the law, the government can boot companies that defraud Medicare and Medicaid out of those programs, but when Novartis got caught, it just paid a penalty \xe2\x80\x94 one so laughably small that its C.E.O. said afterward that it \xe2\x80\x9cremains to be seen\xe2\x80\x9d whether his company would actually consider changing its behavior.'b'Enforcement isn\xe2\x80\x99t about big government or small government. It\xe2\x80\x99s about whether government works and who it works for. Last year, five of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest banks, including JPMorgan Chase, pleaded guilty to criminal charges that they rigged the price of billions of dollars worth of foreign currencies. No corporation can break the law unless people in that corporation also broke the law, but no one from any of those banks has been charged. While thousands of Americans were rotting in prison for nonviolent drug convictions, JPMorgan Chase was so chastened by pleading guilty to a crime that it awarded Jamie Dimon, its C.E.O., a 35 percent raise.'b'To be fair, weak enforcement is sometimes a result of limited authority. Despite the company\xe2\x80\x99s history of egregious safety failures, for example, the former C.E.O. of Massey Energy was convicted only of a single misdemeanor in the deadly Upper Big Branch mine disaster that killed 29 miners in West Virginia in 2010, because federal mining laws are too weak. It\xe2\x80\x99s on Congress to stiffen such penalties.'b'But in many instances, weak enforcement by federal agencies is about the people at the top. Presidents don\xe2\x80\x99t control most day-to-day enforcement decisions, but they do nominate the heads of all the agencies, and these choices make all the difference. Strong leaders at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the Labor Department have pushed those agencies to forge ahead with powerful initiatives to protect the environment, consumers and workers. The Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a tiny office charged with oversight of the post-crash bank bailout, has aggressive leaders \xe2\x80\x94 and a far better record of holding banks and executives accountable than its bigger counterparts.'b'Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission, suffering under weak leadership, is far behind on issuing congressionally mandated rules to avoid the next financial crisis. It has repeatedly granted waivers so that lawbreaking companies can continue to enjoy special privileges, while the Justice Department has dodged one opportunity after another to impose meaningful accountability on big corporations and their executives.'b'Each of these government divisions is headed by someone nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The lesson is clear: Personnel is policy.'b'Legislative agendas matter, but voters should also ask which presidential candidates they trust with the extraordinary power to choose who will fight on the front lines to enforce the laws. The next president can rebuild faith in our institutions by honoring the simple notion that nobody is above the law, but it will happen only if voters demand it.'b'Every time you think that our political discourse can\xe2\x80\x99t get any worse, it does. The Republican primary fight has devolved into a race to the bottom, achieving something you might have thought impossible: making George W. Bush look like a beacon of tolerance and statesmanship. But where is all the nastiness coming from?'b'Well, there\xe2\x80\x99s debate about that \xe2\x80\x94 and it\xe2\x80\x99s a debate that is at the heart of the Democratic contest.'b'Like many people, I\xe2\x80\x99ve described the competition between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders as an argument between competing theories of change, which it is. But underlying that argument is a deeper dispute about what\xe2\x80\x99s wrong with America, what brought us to the state we\xe2\x80\x99re in.'b'To oversimplify a bit \xe2\x80\x94 but only, I think, a bit \xe2\x80\x94 the Sanders view is that money is the root of all evil. Or more specifically, the corrupting influence of big money, of the 1 percent and the corporate elite, is the overarching source of the political ugliness we see all around us.'b'The Clinton view, on the other hand, seems to be that money is the root of some evil, maybe a lot of evil, but it isn\xe2\x80\x99t the whole story. Instead, racism, sexism and other forms of prejudice are powerful forces in their own right. This may not seem like a very big difference \xe2\x80\x94 both candidates oppose prejudice, both want to reduce economic inequality. But it matters for political strategy.'b'As you might guess, I\xe2\x80\x99m on the many-evils side of this debate. Oligarchy is a very real issue, and 'b'I was writing'b' about the damaging rise of the 1 percent back when many of today\xe2\x80\x99s Sanders supporters were in elementary school. But it\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand how America\xe2\x80\x99s oligarchs got so powerful.'b'For they didn\xe2\x80\x99t get there just by buying influence (which is not to deny that there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of influence-buying out there). Crucially, the rise of the American hard right was the rise of a coalition, an alliance between an elite seeking low taxes and deregulation and a base of voters motivated by fears of social change and, above all, by hostility toward you-know-who.'b'Yes, there was a concerted, successful effort by billionaires to push America to the right. That\xe2\x80\x99s not conspiracy theorizing; it\xe2\x80\x99s just history, documented at length in Jane Mayer\xe2\x80\x99s eye-opening new book \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Dark Money'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d But that effort wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have gotten nearly as far as it has without the political aftermath of the Civil Rights Act, and the resulting 'b'flip of 'b''b'Southern white voters'b' to the G.O.P.'b'Until recently you could argue that whatever the motivations of conservative voters, the oligarchs remained firmly in control. Racial dog whistles, demagogy on abortion and so on would be rolled out during election years, then put back into storage while the Republican Party focused on its real business of enabling shadow banking and cutting top tax rates.'b'But in this age of Trump, not so much. The 1 percent has no problems with immigration that brings in cheap labor; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want a confrontation over Planned Parenthood; but the base isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking guidance the way it used to.'b'In any case, however, the question for progressives is what all of this says about political strategy.'b'If the ugliness in American politics is all, or almost all, about the influence of big money, then working-class voters who support the right are victims of false consciousness. And it might \xe2\x80\x94 might \xe2\x80\x94 be possible for a candidate preaching economic populism to break through this false consciousness, thereby achieving a revolutionary restructuring of the political landscape, by making a sufficiently strong case that he\xe2\x80\x99s on their side. Some activists go further and call on Democrats to stop talking about social issues other than income inequality, although Mr. Sanders hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone there.'b'On the other hand, if the divisions in American politics aren\xe2\x80\x99t just about money, if they reflect deep-seated prejudices that progressives simply can\xe2\x80\x99t appease, such visions of radical change are na\xc3\xafve. And I believe that they are.'b'That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t say that movement toward progressive goals is impossible \xe2\x80\x94 America is becoming both more diverse and more tolerant over time. Look, for example, at how quickly opposition to gay marriage has gone from a reliable vote-getter for the right to a Republican liability.'b'But there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of real prejudice out there, and probably enough so that political revolution from the left is off the table. Instead, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a hard slog at best.'b'Is this an unacceptably downbeat vision? Not to my eyes. After all, one reason the right has gone so berserk is that the Obama years have in fact been marked by significant if incomplete progressive victories, on health policy, taxes, financial reform and the environment. And isn\xe2\x80\x99t there something noble, even inspiring, about fighting the good fight, year after year, and gradually making things better?'b'In the 44 years since the two major parties have allowed a small cohort of Midwesterners to decide the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first presidential contest, the good people of Iowa have debated issues ranging from nuclear Armageddon to universal health care.'b'And then there\xe2\x80\x99s 2016, when the top two Republican candidates in the dwindling hours before caucusgoers pick a nominee are throwing around this question: \xe2\x80\x9cHow stupid are the people of Iowa?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was Donald Trump who first raised the issue of Hawkeye State imbecility, in a mocking reference to a crush that Iowans had on Ben Carson last fall. And it\xe2\x80\x99s the odious Ted Cruz who has been using Trump\xe2\x80\x99s very words to goad Iowans into proving that they are not, in fact, so stupid as to back an ego-inflamed reality television star who makes fun of them.'b'We will know soon enough. But before leaving the fog in the rental car\xe2\x80\x99s rearview mirror, let\xe2\x80\x99s take a whack at the insanity of allowing one state such disproportionate power.'b'The problem is not that the people of Iowa are stupid. They are not, by most measurements. It\xe2\x80\x99s that Iowa looks nothing like the rest of America. As a result, the winners, more often than not, are nationally unelectable extremists. Who can remember President Rick Santorum or President Mike Huckabee, both previous winners? Or President Uncommitted, who beat Jimmy Carter in 1976? And what to make of the finding that 43 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers this year are self-described socialists, prepared to select a dyspeptic and unelectable senator as their candidate?'b'You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be vetting, Iowa. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to be culling out the crazies. You\xe2\x80\x99re supposed to recognize the fraud of Ted Cruz and how Donald Trump is playing you. For all your touted small-town verities, you\xe2\x80\x99re not doing your job. Your bull manure detector is broken.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to let other states have a go at it. At least we\xe2\x80\x99ll hear less about corn subsidies and Corinthians II, or is it Two Corinthians? Discuss. No, 'b'don\xe2\x80\x99t! 'b'Stupid, stupid people. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s Trump talking, not me. He uses that word to describe nearly everyone not named Donald J. Trump. He\xe2\x80\x99s presented no governing philosophy, no policy details, nothing resembling even-keeled judgment. He\xe2\x80\x99s running a combustible celebrity feud fest, and you love it.'b'As a bellwether, the Iowa caucuses are no more predictive than a gasbag on an ethanol high swaying from a bridge in Madison County. As a representative exercise relevant to the concerns of a nation of 322 million people, the caucuses are laughable.'b'Consider that half of all the babies born last year in the United States were nonwhite. Not in Iowa, of course, one of the whitest states in the nation. On Monday, if the Republican caucus is anything like the 2012 turnout, 99 percent of the attendants will be white. That\xe2\x80\x99s not even the United States of 1816, let alone this year.'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re a young nation, though you won\xe2\x80\x99t see much of that fresh blood when Republicans gather on Monday night. Iowa is the fourth oldest state in the nation: In 2012, nearly seven out of 10 Republican caucusgoers was older than age 45.'b'And Iowa women are not leaning in, at least in one party, where a majority of Republican caucusgoers are men. As for religion, 57 percent of 2012 Republican caucusgoers were evangelical \xe2\x80\x94 more than twice the percentage of the electorate nationwide.'b'What do these demographics do? They produce candidates who deny that climate change even exists, who favor total bans on legal abortion, who are opposed to the most common-sensical reforms in gun laws, and who would require a religious test for entry into the country. All of those positions are out of step with the views of a country that\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to reflect majority will.'b'Trump can call for a police state pogrom against 11 million people and be rewarded, because a majority of Republican caucusgoers are white, native-born and believe that electing a demagogue will make American white again.'b'The evangelicals, in particular, deserve Trump\xe2\x80\x99s taunt at their intelligence. Devout Christians profess a belief in piety, humility and sacrifice. The thrice-married Trump says he\xe2\x80\x99s never asked God for forgiveness. His entire campaign is about pride, ego, solipsistic excess. He can\xe2\x80\x99t even fake evangelical speak. For this, he\xe2\x80\x99s their favorite. As he said, he could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and not lose supporters.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s time to rotate. Imagine Trump making his racially incendiary remarks in the most populous state, California, where 'b'Latinos outnumber whites'b'. Or think of the ideas that could emerge from a focus on how the least populous state, Wyoming, could build a more sustainable economy beyond oil and gas. Missouri could bring its raw racial troubles to the table for a larger national debate.'b'None of this is discussed in the gloomy chill of Iowa. Instead, we have the stupidity question. Trump raised it. And if he wins on Monday, the people of Iowa will have answered him.'b'The Supreme Court had people like Taurus Buchanan in mind this week when it 'b'reinforced a 2012 decision'b' banning mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles and found that people sentenced before that ruling had a constitutional right to seek parole.'b'The Buchanan case, documented in an investigation by 'b'T'b''b'he Marshall Project'b' and Mother Jones magazine, illustrates what the court meant when it found that it was morally and constitutionally wrong to equate emotionally undeveloped children with adults. It also offers a lesson in how the country went terribly wrong in the early 1990s when it erased some of the legal distinctions between children and adults in the interest of getting \xe2\x80\x9ctough on crime.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Buchanan, who is 39 and an inmate at the infamous Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola, was just 16 when he was convicted of second-degree murder for throwing just one punch during a street fight, leaving a 12-year-old boy dead. He was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.'b'He was tried in 1994, at the height of the national hysteria about \xe2\x80\x9csuper predator\xe2\x80\x9d children who were said to be taking over the streets. State legislatures across the country were passing laws that made it easier to try children as adults and that sometimes eliminated age as a mitigating factor in their sentences. This included Louisiana, where a second-degree-murder charge required that he be tried as an adult because he was over the age of 14.'b'According to the Marshall investigation, Louisiana has more juvenile offenders serving life sentences per capita than any other state. The racial disparities are appalling. For example, of the 247 people serving juvenile life sentences, 199 are African-American. The situations is worse in East Baton Rouge Parish, where Mr. Buchanan was tried. The parish is nearly half white, but virtually all of the people sentenced as juveniles to life without parole are black.'b'Mr. Buchanan was prosecuted by a young lawyer looking to make a reputation and who referred to the teenager as a \xe2\x80\x9ccoldblooded murderer\xe2\x80\x9d to win a second-degree-murder conviction.'b'A decade later, the lawyer encountered Mr. Buchanan during a trip to Angola prison for a boxing tournament. He said he was startled to find the dignified, respectful man that the teenager had grown into. He told The Marshall Project that he should never have pushed for the murder charge and should have gone for manslaughter instead. \xe2\x80\x9cI think I went too far. If the State of Louisiana lets him out, I would fall on my knees and thank God.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A juror who voted to convict Mr. Buchanan recently said he was uneasy about the life sentence because the defendant was so young: \xe2\x80\x9cAt 16, we just aren\xe2\x80\x99t who we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be.\xe2\x80\x9d Louisiana can never return to Mr. Buchanan the years that he has lost behind bars. But it can release him from prison when he has a clemency hearing next month.'b'The people of Ireland have shown a commendable willingness to strike anachronistic bias from the country\xe2\x80\x99s laws, most emphatically in legalizing gay marriage last year in a referendum approved by three out of five voters. With a general election expected next month, a movement is underway in the rapidly changing nation to target another hurtful social condition by which non-Catholic children are legally denied seats at overcrowded state-financed 'b'primary schools'b', 97 percent of which are controlled by Catholic authorities.'b'With schools allowed to give preference to Catholics, other families are forced to have their children baptized in the church, linger on school waiting lists or search for scarce alternatives. Only 74 of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s 3,200 primary schools are run by Educate Together, the main multidenominational alternative, whose Dublin schools are swamped with four applications for every available space.'b'The public is fast realizing this is an intolerable situation in a country with an increasing immigrant population of non-Catholics and a rising generation of younger nonpracticing Catholics. A poll last month measured almost 85 percent public approval for changing the law so it no longer tolerates religious bias against schoolchildren.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIreland is changing, there are a lot of young parents and they want something different for their kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Eoghan Murphy, a Fine Gael member of Parliament, 'b'told Politico'b' in calling for school fairness as the first priority of the next government. The Irish education minister, Jan O\xe2\x80\x99Sullivan of the Labor Party, is similarly calling for reassessment of the law that exempts religious schools from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination requirements if the rebuffing of nonbelievers is considered essential to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain the ethos of the school.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is a citizens\xe2\x80\x99 petition to repeal the law and a legal challenge is planned by Education Equality, an advocacy group. The bias clause has been challenged by the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has taken a position against it, too.'b'Church officials are at odds, with some urging a slow evolution toward a more open-door policy in the schools. Clearly the current policy is at odds with a modern Ireland. The most encouraging force in the debate is the Irish public\xe2\x80\x99s realization that their nation can no longer afford shameful religious bias to remain in the law.'b'IOWA is the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top producer of corn, and nearly half of it ends up as ethanol, thanks to a government mandate that requires ethanol to be mixed into gasoline. The mandate is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to farmers there.'b'No wonder most Iowans talk it up, as do most of the presidential candidates campaigning there in the lead up to the caucuses.'b'Ethanol thrives because of the volume-based approach of the mandate, which specifies that a growing percentage of various renewable fuels must be mixed into gasoline every year until 2022.'b'But that approach has stifled innovation and, if its track record to date is any indication, biofuels will not be a major player in meeting our 2050 targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks.'b'What we should be talking about is a performance-based approach to developing gasoline substitutes that will reduce emissions. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had much greater success using this approach and allowing the market to decide which technology works best to meet a target set by the government.'b'For instance, when the 'b'Environmental Protection Agency'b' set 2025 limits for greenhouse gas emissions for cars at half of 2008 levels, automakers were given flexibility on how to make that happen. Some companies are investing heavily in 'b'electric vehicles'b'; others are focusing on hybrids and fuel cells. So far, all have met their interim goals.'b'Not so with the ethanol mandate, which requires that 36 billion gallons of biofuels must be mixed into gasoline by 2022. Of that, about 85 percent of that blend is supposed to come from a nearly even mix of corn ethanol and cellulosics (derived from wood chips, 'b'corn stover'b', grasses and other nonedible plant parts).'b'But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what is happening. Because corn ethanol is cheap and easy to produce and was already in use as a gasoline additive before the mandate was imposed, and because existing corn ethanol plants are exempted from greenhouse gas emissions requirements, production has vastly exceeded that of cellulosic ethanol. In 2014, less than 2 percent of the mandated volume of cellulosics was produced.'b'This is a problem. At best, corn ethanol provides a 20 percent reduction in greenhouse gas pollution over gasoline, while cellulosic fuel produces an 80 percent reduction in that pollution and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t compete with food.'b'The cellulosic industry has taken much longer to get off the ground than Congress anticipated. Production of this fuel is more complex and costly and requires significant upfront investments.'b'If we could start again from zero, a performance-based standard would produce better results. Setting the standard based on how clean the fuel should be would give companies the flexibility to figure out how to reach the target.'b'This is already being done in California and Oregon, which have performance-based fuel standards. The California program, for instance, requires fuel producers to reduce greenhouse gas pollution by 10 percent in transportation fuels in 2020. Because it is technology neutral, and interested only in the result, this approach supports investments in the cleanest fuels while providing maximum flexibility to the industry to develop them.'b'Still, the existing federal fuel standard, as imperfect as it may be, is now an essential component of our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and slow 'b'climate change'b'.'b'To move forward, the E.P.A. should phase in the fuel standard mandate in a predictable way to provide a growing market for advanced and cellulosic renewable fuels. We also need to shift tax policy for cellulosic fuels to support long-term investment similar to the tax policies for wind and 'b'solar power'b'. And we need several more states to adopt performance-based standards, and to support investment to encourage the development of the next generation of renewable fuels.'b'The United States needs to reduce carbon pollution from cars and trucks by 80 percent by 2050. Advances in propulsion technology alone will not be enough to meet that goal. Passenger cars will have to not only go farther on less fuel, but also travel those miles on lower-carbon fuel.'b'As the candidates continue their quest for the White House, the question should not be, as it was in Iowa, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you support the renewable fuel standard?\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we move to the next generation of renewable fuels?\xe2\x80\x9d We must demand an approach that spurs innovation and makes steady progress on lower-carbon fuels.'b'DES MOINES \xe2\x80\x94 Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s absence, of course, was the most compelling presence.'b'At the Republican debate here on Thursday night, Fox News didn\xe2\x80\x99t put up an empty lectern. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to. Trump was remembered. Trump was invoked. His ghost lingered, because he\xe2\x80\x99d reshaped his Republican rivals\xe2\x80\x99 images, reconfigured the challenges in front of them, rewritten the rules of this extraordinary race.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s address the elephant not in the room tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Megyn Kelly at the very start, and there was no doubt that the tusked behemoth in question had an oddly shaped swirl of vaguely cantaloupe-colored hair. She then asked Ted Cruz what message Trump\xe2\x80\x99s failure to attend the event sent to the voters of Iowa.'b'Cruz didn\xe2\x80\x99t just discuss Trump. He imitated him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a maniac, and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz said. Addressing Ben Carson, he added: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re a terrible surgeon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow that we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He was mocking Trump, but in the process affirmed that everything revolves around Trump.'b'Almost a half-hour later, he was 'b'still 'b'making fun of Trump.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you guys ask one more mean question, I may have to leave the stage,\xe2\x80\x9d Cruz warned sarcastically.'b'Marco Rubio got in on the action by chiming in: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I\xe2\x80\x99m not leaving the stage no matter what you ask me.\xe2\x80\x9d The point of reference remained Trump, who was also the subject of some of the first words out of Jeb Bush\xe2\x80\x99s mouth.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI kind of miss Donald Trump,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was a little teddy bear to me.\xe2\x80\x9d He then claimed that in debates past, he had taken on Trump more boldly than any of his competitors on the stage. Trump, in other words, was the proof of his mettle, the dragon that he alone set out to slay.'b'Shortly before the event began, Rupert Murdoch, the founder of Fox News, tweeted, \xe2\x80\x9cRepublican candidates must be looking forward to tonight\xe2\x80\x99s debate. Speaking without Donald getting all attention.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b''b''b'Wishful thinking.'b'Trump got plenty of attention, because the drama offstage matched the drama onstage. For the two days leading up to the event, the main story \xe2\x80\x94 seemingly the 'b'only 'b'story \xe2\x80\x94 was his decision to skip it: Political suicide or stroke of genius?'b'In the hours before it, CNN could speak of almost nothing but Trump. It kept flashing footage of the fan-packed rally he had orchestrated just a couple of miles from the debate, to compete with it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are thousands who have waited hours throughout the day,\xe2\x80\x9d the anchor Erin Burnett marveled.'b'When her colleague Anderson Cooper then interviewed a CNN correspondent at the debate itself, the first question he asked her was about how the debaters were likely to adjust to a Trump-less event.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis shadow is looming large, even though he is not there,\xe2\x80\x9d Cooper said to the correspondent, then he turned to the network\xe2\x80\x99s panel of political analysts, who talked about Trump, Trump, Trump.'b'And here I am, writing about Trump, Trump, Trump.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s impossible not to. It would be irresponsible not to, because believe it or not, hate it or love it, he\xe2\x80\x99s the Republican campaign\xe2\x80\x99s great and sobering lesson to the country, telling us things about its discontents that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t properly understand. He\xe2\x80\x99s the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s undeniable force of gravity, exerting a pull on everyone and everything around him.'b'You could feel that pull at the debate, where the toughness with which Kelly grilled Cruz and Rubio on immigration \xe2\x80\x94 even showing footage of past remarks that caught them in flips, flops and contradictions \xe2\x80\x94 was a clear demonstration of her readiness to put any candidate on the skewer, not just Trump.'b'You could feel that pull in the fieriness of many candidates\xe2\x80\x99 manners and the extremes to which they pushed their positions. Trump has set the temperature of the conversation, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a blistering one that had Rubio pledging over and over to keep Guant\xc3\xa1namo Bay open and stuff it full of terrorists.'b'You could feel that pull above all in the duration and emotionalism of the immigration discussion itself. It\xe2\x80\x99s Trump\xe2\x80\x99s promised wall and Trump\xe2\x80\x99s pledges to deport millions of immigrants that have made this issue so prominent and compelled Republican candidates to take harder lines than they previously had.'b'On Thursday night, those lines tripped up Rubio and Cruz, whose difficult time onstage had everything to do with the fact that Trump wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there. He\xe2\x80\x99s the front-runner; he would have been the main target. Without him, they drew more fire.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m kind of confused,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush said of Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s approach to immigration reform over the years. \xe2\x80\x9cHe led the charge to finally fix this immigration problem that has existed now for, as Marco says, for 30 years. And then he cut and run because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t popular among conservatives, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rubio didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a persuasive response, but later went after Cruz, insinuating that he once had an approach to immigration less unyielding than the one he\xe2\x80\x99s promoting on the campaign trail.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow you want to trump Trump on immigration,\xe2\x80\x9d Rubio said.'b'Political observers have been waiting for Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s breakout moment, and many predicted that he\xe2\x80\x99d have it at this debate. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Put frequently on the defensive, he reverted to lines he\xe2\x80\x99d used before and nuggets from his stump speech, and he kept returning to ISIS and military might, military might and ISIS. He came across as overly programmed, one-dimensional and itchy to go to war.'b'And Cruz couldn\xe2\x80\x99t banish a sour expression and an air of grievance.'b'Three of the underdogs \xe2\x80\x94 Bush, Chris Christie and Rand Paul \xe2\x80\x94 had the best moments. Christie circled back too frequently to his beloved, overworked boast that he would make sure that Hillary Clinton never again got close to the White House, but he had a terrific retort to Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s and Rubio\xe2\x80\x99s explanations of their legislative histories on immigration reform.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I need a Washington-to-English dictionary,\xe2\x80\x9d Christie said.'b'Bush was genuinely funny, as when he reintroduced Trump toward the end of the debate.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI mentioned his name again just if anybody was missing him,\xe2\x80\x9d Bush said.'b'Missing him? Not really. I\xe2\x80\x99d be glad to have him gone for good.'b'But he isn\xe2\x80\x99t and he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t, not on a night when the candidates molded their answers to the reality (and the reality show) that he\xe2\x80\x99s created, not when they felt obliged to bring him up, not when he dominated the discussion without even taking part of it. Nifty trick, that.'b'Elephant, bear, dragon: Those aren\xe2\x80\x99t the right beasts.'b'What the debate made clear is that Trump is all fox.'b'Next month\xe2\x80\x99s elections in 'b'Iran'b' do not bode well for Iranians eager for more political and social freedoms or for the promising new relationship with the West symbolized by the recent deal limiting Iran\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'nuclear program'b'. Even before any ballots are cast, the death-to-America hard-liners who bitterly opposed the deal are stacking the deck against moderates led by President Hassan Rouhani, who signed the agreement and is more open than others in the power structure to further engagement with Western nations as well as expanding rights and freedoms for Iranian citizens.'b'The hard-liners are in a good position to prevail in the Feb. 26 polls because of political manipulation and a nominating process that gives a small group of people enormous power over who can and cannot run.'b'On that day, Iranians will vote for a 290-member Parliament and an 88-member Assembly of Experts, which is charged with selecting a new supreme leader when the incumbent, Ayatollah 'b'Ali Khamenei'b', who is 76 and reportedly ailing, dies. In a sign of heightened interest in electoral politics, some 'b'12,000'b' Iranians registered to run in the election for Parliament, more than double the 5,405 who registered in 2012. Yet, more than 7,000 of those would-be candidates were disqualified by the Council of Guardians, a 12-member group appointed partly by the supreme leader and partly by the judiciary.'b'Last week, nine reformist political parties complained that the council had approved only 30 of the 3,000 moderates who registered, and urged top leaders to reverse the disqualifications. Of the 'b'801 candidates'b' who had filed to run for the Assembly of Experts, only 166 were approved.'b'On'b' Tuesday 'b'came word that not even the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who founded the Islamic Republic in 1979, could pass muster with the ideologues who are determined to maintain control and resist change. The grandson, Hassan Khomeini, a cleric, wanted to run for the Assembly of Experts but was told that the council could not establish his \xe2\x80\x9cscientific qualifications.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The council has not publicly explained what that means, but it seems likely that Mr. Khomeini was rejected because he is close to Mr. Rouhani and other reformers. Human Rights Watch says it reviewed documents that show 'b'significant numbers 'b'of candidates were disqualified for their political opinions.'b'Iran does not have anything close to a real democracy. Mr. Rouhani is a creature of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s establishment, not a revolutionary. But he has tapped into widespread popular support for ending the country\xe2\x80\x99s long isolation. Because of the nuclear deal, which required Iran to sharply limit its nuclear program, crippling sanctions have been lifted and Iranian officials are now being welcomed again in world capitals as they seek business deals and acceptance. Even so, Mr. Rouhani, who won election in 2013, has yet to deliver on 'b'campaign pledges 'b'to restore basic freedoms, including free speech and the release of political prisoners. Hundreds of political activists and journalists remain in prison, according to the 'b'Iran Human Rights Documentation Center'b'; Iran is a leading executioner of prisoners, including juveniles.'b'The narrow candidate selection process has provoked an unusual public argument among senior officials and clerics. Ayatollah Khamenei has warned against relaxing Iran\xe2\x80\x99s anti-Western stance, voiced strong support for the vetting process and said the reformers could not hope to have any real influence in the immediate future. 'b'Mr. Rouhani 'b''b'responded 'b'by saying that Parliament must \xe2\x80\x9cbelong to all people and reflect the realities of the nation\xe2\x80\x9d and added, \xe2\x80\x9cIf one faction is represented in the elections and another is not, then why are we holding elections?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though candidates can appeal their disqualifications, minimal changes are expected. How rank-and-file Iranians will respond to the disenfranchisement is unclear. After the fraudulent 2009 presidential election, millions of people joined protests, prompting a government crackdown. Reform-minded Iranians could still have an impact this time by mustering a large voter turnout and electing at least a few more like-minded candidates to office.'b'In a letter this week to the Guardian Council that was posted on the opposition website, a prominent religious figure and reformist, Grand Ayatollah Ali Mohammad Dastgheib, criticized the council for \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledging the rights of only 30 percent of our voters\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested this could \xe2\x80\x9ccreate a huge rift between the people and the leadership.\xe2\x80\x9d How this debate plays out will have profound consequences not just for Iran but for the region as well.'b''b'To the Editor:'b''b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn Paper, Italy Allows Abortions, but Few Doctors Will Perform Them\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (news article, Jan. 17) presents the challenges women in Italy face in getting abortions because of providers claiming conscientious objection.

ROBERT IRVIN'b'President, American Rivers'b'Washington'b'Just a little over a year ago, voters in Sri Lanka rallied to elect a new president, with high hopes that he would usher in a new era of government accountability and bring healing to a country fractured by the brutal civil war that ended in 2009. President Maithripala Sirisena has taken bold steps to fulfill those hopes since his election last January.'b'But the wounds of war cannot be healed until a transitional justice process demanded by the United Nations in a resolution last October moves forward. On that score, Mr. Sirisena says his government will not act \xe2\x80\x9cin haste.\xe2\x80\x9d This is unacceptable. Atrocities were committed by both Tamil rebel troops and the Sri Lankan Army during the civil war. The perpetrators must be brought to trial.'b'Mr. Sirisena has amply demonstrated a capacity to lead during the year he has held office. He has presided over promised parliamentary elections, and has moved to dismantle the cronyism and the repressive regime of his predecessor, Mahinda Rajapaksa. He has also moved to include Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s minority Tamils and Muslims in the country\xe2\x80\x99s governance, to release political prisoners and to allow more freedom of expression. And he has righted the Rajapaksa government\xe2\x80\x99s tilt toward China, taking a balanced approach to Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s foreign relations that includes warmer relations with India and the United States. This month, Mr. Sirisena announced the beginning of a process to draft a new constitution.'b'These are welcome steps. But they are no substitute for justice. Troubling allegations of torture under Mr. Sirisena\xe2\x80\x99s watch \xe2\x80\x94 which his government denies \xe2\x80\x94 must be addressed. Military leaders who oversaw the bloody operations that killed as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians in the final months of the war remain in command, and have even been promoted. A dangerous anti-Muslim campaign by Singhalese nationalists is threatening to further fray Sri Lanka\xe2\x80\x99s ethnic fabric.'b'Last fall, the United Nations agreed to allow Sri Lanka to set up its own special court on war crimes. Mr. Sirisena needs to move quickly to fulfill his government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to the United Nations and its moral duty to Sri Lankans.'b'Athens \xe2\x80\x94 It may just be coincidence, but 'b'in the year'b' since a radical left movement and an extreme right-wing party 'b'joined forces'b' to govern 'b'Greece'b', the resilience of the 'b'European Union'b' has been tested. But it may be also that the forces released in Greece have emerged in many other countries, poisoning relations among member states.'b'The glue that holds Greece\xe2\x80\x99s paradoxical coalition together, and which we see across Europe, is populism. Not some coherent ideology that puts the people\xe2\x80\x99s interests first, but a policy based on opportunism, on cultivating a grandiose sense of national identity and then presenting that identity as being threatened by domestic and foreign enemies. It uses current problems to undermine efforts at solutions, and conjures past and future utopias rather than trying to keep up with dizzying change.'b'Greece has been plagued by domestic divisions for most of its modern history. It is easy to see foreign creditors\xe2\x80\x99 supervision of our economy, and their pressure on our political system, as a new chapter in a national epic of resistance.'b'Similar forces are at play, to some extent, in Poland, Hungary, Portugal and Spain \xe2\x80\x94 wherever foreign domination or domestic dictatorships still loom large in national narratives. In France, the National Front sees Brussels and immigrants as the enemy. Demagogues are able to claim that they represent the people against foreigners and their lackeys in the local political and media elites, especially when European institutions and local politicians do not seem to have easy solutions to problems.'b'In Germany, politicians and the news media presented the Greeks as moochers trying to get their hands on Germans\xe2\x80\x99 hard-earned cash. Coping with a flood of refugees makes some Germans feel they are victims of circumstances once again, and lays the ground for xenophobia and nationalism. Several other wealthier European Union countries also feel their way of life and identity are threatened, and fear further unification. In Britain, an argumentative minority found a reason to exist by accusing Brussels of interfering with national sovereignty, prompting Prime Minister David Cameron to risk his country\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the European Union 'b'with a referendum'b'.'b'A chasm separates the social liberalism and internationalism of Syriza from the Christian Nationalism of its right-wing partner, the Independent Greeks. When the government presented a law allowing civil partnerships of same-sex couples, it was passed with votes from Syriza and opposition parties; most Independent Greeks voted against it.'b'Yet the two parties stick together. Before their election a year ago this week, they presented themselves as patriots fighting foreigners and local elites. They built on anti-German anger in public gatherings and the media \xe2\x80\x94 where German politicians were routinely portrayed as Nazis \xe2\x80\x94 demanding reparations from Berlin and paying highly charged 'b'visits to memorials of wartime atrocities'b'. They backed a campaign of civil defiance (called 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t pay\xe2\x80\x9d'b'), arguing that it was not Greece that owed money to its creditors, but the other way around. Syriza\xe2\x80\x99s leader, Alexis Tsipras, undermined every reform effort by previous governments, promising voters that the \xe2\x80\x9cday after\xe2\x80\x9d his party\xe2\x80\x99s election he would scrap the bailout agreement, with its hated austerity and reforms.'b'Demagogues oversimplify things by making false promises and excessive accusations. They \xe2\x80\x94 and, through them, their supporters \xe2\x80\x94 are always in the right, no matter how mixed up reality may be. At the same time, they complicate things needlessly, often employing primitive conspiracy theories so that no one can understand what must be done.'b'In Greece, the populist narrative was that the local and foreign elites ran up huge debts that the citizens were then forced to pay through reduced incomes, higher taxes and unemployment. Instead of noting that the Greek state was spending beyond its means and had to be reformed, Syriza argued that simply by voting for it, citizens could end the pain, and all the measures of the past few years would be reversed.'b'Technicalities \xe2\x80\x94 European Union regulations regarding the rule of law, the possible suspension of loans, the fact that the European Central Bank could withhold 'b'emergency funding'b' \xe2\x80\x94 were depicted as machinations aimed at undermining the pure patriots in power.'b'The argument was so convincing that even after the coalition government was forced to default on the International Monetary Fund, 'b'close Greece\xe2\x80\x99s banks'b', impose controls on the movement of capital and then accept the terms of an onerous new bailout with creditors, the two parties were 'b'returned to power'b' in snap elections last September. Anyone in Brussels or Berlin who thinks that Warsaw, Budapest or any other member state\xe2\x80\x99s capital will give in to pressure on issues they see as pertaining to national sovereignty need only look at how far the Greeks were prepared to go before capitulating, and how the voters stayed with them.'b'This kind of populism makes partnerships extremely difficult. It creates a climate of suspicion and ill will. In Greece, the more our partners and creditors press for compliance with the bailout agreements, the more they are seen as impinging on our sovereignty, stoking further resistance. At the same time, Greek reluctance or inability to achieve something is seen as a direct affront to its partners.'b'We noted this in the economy; now we see it in the refugee crisis. Greece is accused \xe2\x80\x94 simplistically \xe2\x80\x94 of not stopping the influx. Countries that backed a German idea to 'b'suspend Greece'b' from the eurozone last year are among those threatening to suspend Greece\xe2\x80\x99s membership in the open-borders system known as the Schengen Agreement. Some of them, however, are also opposed to a German-inspired plan to spread refugees among all European Union members, prompting Germans to feel they have been left in the lurch. The end of civility among members is contagious. Scapegoating Greece helps gloss over this problem \xe2\x80\x94 another populist trick.'b'Populist demagogy is a highly effective way of gaining power and consolidating it. Playing the people against elites, dividing citizens into patriots and quislings, seeing the world as \xe2\x80\x9cus versus them\xe2\x80\x9d and oversimplifying issues in a complex, pluralistic world provide the illusion of national determination and an outlet for public anger.'b'But however effective populism is in domestic politics, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dead end: Countries that give in to its charms cannot find the strength to reform, and are alone when facing the problems that inspired their inward turn in the first place. In Greece, a rising wave of anger at inevitable reforms signals the failure of easy promises. In the globalized world, economic competitiveness, climate change, mass migration, terrorism and other challenges can only be dealt with collectively \xe2\x80\x94 no matter how much any nation, party or citizen may feel that isolation is an option.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 When America catches a cold, Britain sneezes \xe2\x80\x94 eventually. The argument about the proper limits of free speech and \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical correctness\xe2\x80\x9d that has raged for years on American campuses has arrived at British universities with a vengeance.'b'Here, the fate of one statue in Oxford has become the focus of fierce debate.'b'The stone figure of Cecil Rhodes, the mining magnate who gave his name to the southern African state of Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, has graced the facade of Oriel College since before World War I. Rhodes, who lived from 1853 to 1902, 'b'left'b' this college, his alma mater, a substantial bequest. In addition, the university has a Rhodes professorship of race relations and every year admits a phalanx of talented young people from abroad, 'b'including'b' 32 Americans, on Rhodes scholarships. (Bill Clinton, George Stephanopoulos, Bobby Jindal and Susan Rice are all alumni.)'b'Now, though, a campaign calling itself \xe2\x80\x9cRhodes Must Fall\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 one of whose founders, ironically, is a Rhodes scholar from South Africa, Ntokozo Qwabe \xe2\x80\x94 has demanded the statue\xe2\x80\x99s removal. The protesters\xe2\x80\x99 argument is that for all his achievements, Rhodes held views that are completely unacceptable to modern sensibilities.'b'In an 1877 essay \xe2\x80\x9cConfession of Faith,\xe2\x80\x9d composed in Oxford, Rhodes wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cI contend that we are the first race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race.\xe2\x80\x9d As well as believing in the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon people, he was an early enforcer of racial segregation in South Africa and thus a forefather of the apartheid system.'b'England\xe2\x80\x99s so-called ancient universities, Oxford and Cambridge, have often been a nursery for what have become national debates. In 1933, the Oxford Union debating society caused a scandal by 'b'supporting'b' the motion \xe2\x80\x9cthat this House will in no circumstances fight for its King and Country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More recently, in 2000, Gordon Brown, who was then the chancellor of the Exchequer, 'b'drew'b' national attention to Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s failure to offer a place to a state school pupil, Laura Spence, in spite of her superb grades. The case became emblematic \xe2\x80\x94 unfairly, the university insisted \xe2\x80\x94 of the grip that fee-paying schools supposedly still have over admissions to Oxford and Cambridge.'b'In the same spirit, the row over Rhodes has metastasized into a bigger argument over the political meaning of such memorials and their potential hurtfulness. The protest has spread to another college where undergraduates 'b'voted'b' to change the name of its Rhodes computer room. Oriel\xe2\x80\x99s authorities, though 'b'standing'b' their ground on the statue, announced they would take down from another building a plaque commemorating Rhodes. And the campaigners were encouraged that the University of Cape Town, under similar pressure, 'b'removed'b' a statue of Rhodes last year.'b'It is important to acknowledge that in our complex, pluralist society, no person or institution is free to do entirely as they please. What civilized place of learning would today tolerate a statue of Adolf Hitler being erected on its grounds?'b'This is because, naturally, we have moral values \xe2\x80\x94 ones that are appropriate to our era. But for that very reason, if we build a monument that is consonant with those standards, then, reasonably, we expect it to be respected by future generations.'b'A salient fact about the Oriel statue of Rhodes is its date: 1911. It is an echo in stone of a different time.'b'In a college as old as Oriel, 'b'founded'b' in 1324, the buildings represent something like an accumulation of geological strata. In the quadrangles of Oxford, one can see how such antique institutions grow and adapt across generations and over centuries. This is not a museum but an organism that is constantly evolving, neither shedding its past nor uncritically celebrating every aspect of it.'b'There is a modernist urge to wipe away the past and replace it with the new, but we should resist it.'b'The most robust defense of the Rhodes statue came from the university\xe2\x80\x99s chancellor, the former Conservative politician and governor of Hong Kong Chris Patten, who 'b'told'b' students that they should embrace the freedom of expression that an education at Oxford entails or \xe2\x80\x9cthink about being educated elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d The Cambridge classics professor Mary Beard made a similar argument, 'b'urging'b' Britons \xe2\x80\x9cto look history in the eye and reflect on our awkward relationship to it, and what we are actually beneficiaries of, not simply to Photoshop the nasty bits out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She had advice for those who find such effigies offensive. \xe2\x80\x9cThe battle isn\xe2\x80\x99t won by taking the statue away and pretending those people didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s won by empowering those students to look up at Rhodes and friends with a cheery and self-confident sense of unbatterability.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the heart of the matter. Higher education has changed immeasurably in Britain over the last 30 years; it has become a path taken by almost half of all teenagers, rather than being the privilege of a small minority. And students now contribute much more to the cost of their tuition, mostly through loans.'b'What has not changed, in theory at least, is the idea that higher education should test, provoke and expand young minds, confronting them with intellectual difficulty rather than coddling them. This is the principle at stake in the Rhodes statue test case.'b'Oriel is right to distance itself from Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99s repugnant views on racial superiority, but to remove the statue would be a colossal disservice to Oxford students. Protecting them from the challenge of history by obliterating uncomfortable facts about the past would infantilize them.'b'It would be a terrible precedent in this country, and because of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s renown, it would make headlines around the world. If Oxford is forced to take down its historic statuary, why stop there? Next for demolition: Mount Rushmore.'b'Nearly four decades after his father founded the Moral Majority, Jerry Falwell Jr. is presiding over the biggest crisis the modern evangelical coalition has ever had to face.'b'With his 'b'endorsement'b' of Donald J. Trump for president on Tuesday, the younger Mr. Falwell has dismayed his fellow conservative evangelicals and baffled many others, who think it\xe2\x80\x99s counterintuitive that Mr. Falwell would endorse this thrice-married reality television star.'b'Mr. Falwell is the president of his father\xe2\x80\x99s Liberty University, seen by some as the official voice of evangelicalism. Does this mean the whole movement will follow \xe2\x80\x94 or at least most of it?'b'The answer is no, and the reason is that while the Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. was long the face of the religious right \xe2\x80\x94 the go-to guy for reporters, the talking head on Americans\xe2\x80\x99 television screens \xe2\x80\x94 his son has never played that role, even within evangelicalism. Mr. Falwell is influential, certainly, but today no one can lay claim to such a monolithic status. Even his own constituents, graduates of Liberty University, have 'b'questioned'b' his judgment in endorsing Mr. Trump. The Trump endorsement demonstrates just how fractured evangelicals have become in this presidential contest, and how none of the candidates can count on a single leader to unite the evangelical vote behind him.'b'Over the decades since the elder Falwell helped start the modern religious right, politicized evangelicalism has expanded beyond a handful of organizations, producing a multitude of spokesmen, among them pastors, activists, televangelists, authors and opportunists. It\xe2\x80\x99s now almost impossible to be the singular face of 21st-century evangelicalism. The movement still wields significant power, particularly in Republican politics, but the dalliance with Mr. Trump threatens to undermine its unity.'b'Evangelical leaders have spent decades demanding that presidential candidates pledge to govern a \xe2\x80\x9cChristian nation\xe2\x80\x9d by fusing conservative Christianity and government, producing obedient foot soldiers like Mike Huckabee, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry and Michele Bachmann, none of whom managed to emerge as a real presidential contender.'b'One 2016 candidate, Ted Cruz, is 'b'competing'b' for that mantle, but continues to struggle to keep up with Mr. Trump. Another, Marco Rubio, represents a dissenting movement within the religious right, one that strives to produce a candidate who 'b'eschews'b' harsh culture-war rhetoric while maintaining staunch opposition to abortion and same-sex marriage. Mr. Rubio is trailing both Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz \xe2\x80\x94 a sign that perhaps voters are not quite ready to follow the lead of some 'b'evangelical elites'b' who see the senator from Florida as their top choice.'b'A good segment of evangelical voters appear to have blithely abandoned both the Christian-nation candidacy of Mr. Cruz and the kinder, gentler social conservatism of Mr. Rubio in favor of Mr. Trump, who is unabashedly ignorant of the biblical imperatives that form the foundation of evangelical culture and politics. That Mr. Trump is a Presbyterian and not evangelical is not the issue. It\xe2\x80\x99s that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to understand evangelicalism, or even his own mainline Protestantism, failures that would have been, in recent elections, disqualifiers for evangelical Republican voters.'b'Last year Mr. Trump 'b'couldn\xe2\x80\x99t cite'b' a favorite Bible verse when asked by reporters, a no-brainer part of interview preparation for a Republican presidential candidate, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s disingenuous. He 'b'referred'b' to a communion wafer as \xe2\x80\x9cmy little cracker\xe2\x80\x9d while 'b'boasting'b' that he never seeks God\xe2\x80\x99s forgiveness. Mr. Trump is so confident of his sway over Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s coveted evangelical voters that this week he 'b'called'b' Bob Vander Plaats, a prominent evangelical figure in the state, a \xe2\x80\x9cphony.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet for months, polls have shown Mr. Trump attracting a 'b'quarter'b' to a 'b'third'b' of white evangelical support. A Pew Research Center 'b'survey'b' released on Wednesday found that half of white evangelicals believe that Mr. Trump would make a \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d president. Although Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio are viewed by more voters as \xe2\x80\x9creligious\xe2\x80\x9d than Mr. Trump is, both run behind him among white evangelicals as a potentially \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgreat\xe2\x80\x9d president.'b'While this level of evangelical support could be sufficient to propel Mr. Trump to the Republican nomination, the real story of his rise among evangelical voters is not that he has monopolized them (he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t), but rather how he has brought divisions among them into public view.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s cultivated image as a tough guy who will \xe2\x80\x9cmake America great again\xe2\x80\x9d is a draw for some evangelicals, as Mr. Falwell\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement shows, not to mention the one he got from the former vice-presidential candidate 'b'Sarah Palin'b'. In his endorsement, Mr. Falwell called Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x9ca successful executive and entrepreneur, a wonderful father and a man who I believe can lead our country to greatness again.\xe2\x80\x9d There was no extolling of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Christian virtue.'b'Contrast that with the endorsement of Mr. Cruz, a few hours later, by Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, arguably the pre-eminent political advocacy organization of the religious right. Mr. Perkins, who made his announcement 'b'on the Fox News program'b' of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s b\xc3\xaate noire, Megyn Kelly, called Cruz \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutional conservative who will fight for faith, family and freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Perkins highlighted Mr. Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s defense of Christians\xe2\x80\x99 religious freedom, declaring that the senator from Texas \xe2\x80\x9cwill defend our right to believe and live according to those beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Six months ago, the conventional wisdom was that these religious freedom issues \xe2\x80\x94 such as religious exemptions for employers from providing insurance coverage for contraception or exemptions from providing catering or photography services to same-sex couples \xe2\x80\x94 would form the core of a Republican candidate\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to evangelicals, alongside opposition to abortion and federal funding for Planned Parenthood. Mr. Trump doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even pay lip service to them.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s standing among evangelicals shows just how little those issues matter to a good many erstwhile culture warriors, at least when picking a president. If he turns out to be their standard-bearer, this once-cohesive movement will have to spend this election season asking itself what it really means.'b'This is an interesting moment in relations between the United States and Israel. Call it a poisonous lull. The vitriol around the Iran nuclear deal has subsided. But something is rotten in the special bond.'b'The American ambassador to Israel, Daniel Shapiro, was recently dismissed as a \xe2\x80\x9clittle Jew boy\xe2\x80\x9d by a former aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for saying that \xe2\x80\x9ctwo standards\xe2\x80\x9d seem to apply in the way the law is applied to Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank and that \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much Israeli vigilantism in the West Bank goes on unchecked.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Shapiro was stating the obvious. Israeli settlers are citizens entitled to the full protection of civil law. The 2.8 million Palestinians in the West Bank are not. Their decades-old limbo places them in a permanent state of vulnerability subject to Israeli military law. Israel, in turn, exercises corrosive dominion; hence the vigilantism.'b'What was interesting was that Shapiro chose to speak out \xe2\x80\x94 a reflection of the acute frustration of the Obama administration with Israeli policies that cement what Secretary of State John Kerry has called a \xe2\x80\x9cone-state reality.\xe2\x80\x9d That reality is one in which Israel cannot remain a Jewish and democratic state.'b'The situation was well-described in a Human Rights Watch report published this month: \xe2\x80\x9cOn the one hand, Israel provides settlers, and in many cases settlement businesses, with land, water infrastructure, resources, and financial incentives to encourage the growth of settlements. On the other hand, Israel confiscates Palestinian land, forcibly displaces Palestinians, restricts their freedom of movement, precludes them from building in all but 1 percent of the area of the West Bank under Israeli administrative control, and strictly limits their access to water and electricity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not only within the administration that frustration is running high. The American Jewish community has grown more divided. Increasingly, younger Jews are distancing themselves from Israeli policies seen as unjust, unlawful, immoral or self-defeating. On college campuses where movements like Black Lives Matter have focused minds on issues of oppression and injustice, it does not take much to draw a parallel with the Palestinian cause, however lacking in nuance that analogy may be.'b'A right-wing Israeli government, including illiberal ministers contemptuous of the Palestinian national movement, makes it harder to put the case for support of Israel. If Netanyahu is now an Israeli moderate, what does that say about the extent of Israeli Messianic nationalism?'b'Gary Rosenblatt, the editor of The Jewish Week and a strong supporter of Israel, sent me an article he published recently whose first paragraph reads:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven as Israel endures daily \xe2\x80\x98lone wolf\xe2\x80\x99 attacks from young Palestinians prepared to die for the cause of spilling Jewish blood, American Jewish leaders confide that generating support for the Jewish state is becoming increasingly difficult these days \xe2\x80\x94 even within the Jewish community, and especially among younger people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo be pro-Israel is being seen as more and more of a right-wing thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Amna Farooqi, the president of J Street U, the campus branch of J Street, the liberal pro-Israel, pro-peace Jewish lobbying group, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s false. You can be pro-Israel and progressive, but American Jewish leaders must be transparent on the settlements. You can\xe2\x80\x99t say you support two states if you don\xe2\x80\x99t take a clear position, for example, against funding activities over the Green Line.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Farooqi, a senior at the University of Maryland, is a Pakistani-American Muslim elected to lead J Street U last summer. Raised in an immigrant family critical of Israel, but also in a neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Montgomery County \xe2\x80\x94 that was heavily Jewish, she came gradually to a Zionist\xe2\x80\x99s belief in Israel\xe2\x80\x99s right to exist combined with the conviction that \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot support Israel without grappling with the occupation. Keeping quiet will not help.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When she started college, she initially thought of getting involved with Students for Justice in Palestine, but found there was little interest in engaging people with different views. \xe2\x80\x9cMy talking to people who already believed what I believed was not useful,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to go to Hillel and talk to people who did not believe there was an occupation. Two-state advocacy was easier with J Street. There\xe2\x80\x99s no point sitting in an echo chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Farooqi\xe2\x80\x99s message, through her own many-layered identity in a time of growing polarization, is important. The current situation is unsustainable. As United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, remarked this month, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is human nature to react to occupation, which often serves as a potent incubator of hate and extremism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Palestinian leaders also have a responsibility to curb that hate \xe2\x80\x94 to cease incitement, hold elections, overcome divisions and abandon their sterile retreat into victimhood. But nothing can excuse Israel\xe2\x80\x99s relentless pursuit of the very occupation that undermines it.'b'Close American tax loopholes that benefit settlers. Label West-Bank products so that consumers can make informed decisions. Pressure businesses, as Human Rights Watch puts it, to \xe2\x80\x9ccomply with their own human rights responsibilities by ceasing settlement-related activities.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bozeman, Mont. \xe2\x80\x94 THE armed siege of a federal wildlife refuge in Oregon, which continued Friday even after one of the occupiers was killed in a confrontation with authorities, is the latest battle in a Nevada family\xe2\x80\x99s war with the federal government.'b'It shows little sign of abating.'b'Anger over the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s control of hundreds of millions of acres across the West has been smoldering for over a hundred years. The takeover was part of a campaign that has its roots in the settlement of the West and the desire to transfer control of these lands \xe2\x80\x94 the national forests, parks, wildlife refuges and rangeland \xe2\x80\x94 to the states.'b'The Oregon confrontation was led by two sons of Cliven Bundy, the Nevada rancher who led an armed standoff of his own against federal authorities in 2014 over his illegal grazing on land owned by the Bureau of Land Management.'b'The difference between the Bundys and many other ranchers who rage over federal control of land is that they believe God is on their side.'b'I visited the Bundy family last year on their remote ranch and melon farm in southeastern Nevada for research I\xe2\x80\x99m conducting on the history of Mormon culture and the use of public land. The Bundys are Mormons and interested me because of their extreme position against the government and their engagement of militia groups in their cause.'b'They were welcoming and eager to answer my questions. What emerged in our three hours of conversation in the living room of their modest ranch house was a passion and a sense of entitlement that they believe is anchored in their deep history in the region. They also embrace a strange amalgamation of Mormonism, libertarianism and a right-wing reading of the Constitution.'b'The Bundys trace their roots to some of the first Mormons who settled along an isolated and rugged stretch of the Virgin River, in a place so desolate that it seems impossible to make a living there. But they did, and in doing so, they put their stamp on it, in the Bundys\xe2\x80\x99 view.'b'From the moment their ancestors\xe2\x80\x99 horses took a sip of water or ate the grass, \xe2\x80\x9ca beneficial use of a renewable resource\xe2\x80\x9d was created, Cliven Bundy told me.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s how our rights are created,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cSo now we have created them and we use them, make beneficial use of them, and then we protect them. And that\xe2\x80\x99s sort of a natural law, and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the rancher has done. That\xe2\x80\x99s how he has his rights. And that\xe2\x80\x99s what the range war, the Bundy war, is all about right now, it\xe2\x80\x99s really protecting those three things: our life, liberty and our property.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In Mormon doctrine, the American Constitution is a divinely inspired text that must be protected. This view goes back to the days of the prophet Joseph Smith, who believed the Constitution existed to provide religious freedom and agency, the right of people to choose how they lived.'b'In 1840, Smith warned that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Nation will be on the very verge of crumbling to pieces and tumbling to the ground when the Constitution is upon the brink of ruin; this people will be the Staff upon which the Nation shall lean and they shall bear the Constitution away from the very verge of destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Bundy family sees itself as that Staff. Mr. Bundy carries in his pocket a copy of the Constitution, which he believes draws its inspiration from the Bible. He told me: \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t we believe that Jesus Christ is basically the author of the Bible? Well, if the Constitution is inspired, who is the author? Wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t that author be Jesus Christ again?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the Constitution has been heavily influenced by the work of W. Cleon Skousen, a Mormon, fervent anti-Communist and right-wing political thinker who believed that most federal landholdings are unconstitutional.'b'The Los Angeles Times reported that many Bundy followers in Oregon carried with them a copy of the Constitution annotated by Skousen. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where I get most of my information from,\xe2\x80\x9d Cliven Bundy told the paper.'b'But while Joseph Smith focused on the First Amendment as a bulwark against the persecutions of Mormons, the Bundys are focused on the 10th Amendment, which they believe severely restricts the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s power to possess land. (Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have condemned the Oregon takeover and said in a statement that they were \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply troubled by the reports that those who have seized the facility suggest that they were doing it based on scriptural principles.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'The Bundy worldview aligns closely with the states\xe2\x80\x99 rights movement and efforts in the West to transfer federal lands to the states and local governments. Just last week, eight ranchers in Utah announced that they would stop paying grazing fees to the federal government and put the money into escrow until ownership of the federal land they lease is resolved. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is as an act of civil disobedience in response to a long trail of abuses,\xe2\x80\x9d a lawyer connected to the effort told The Salt Lake City Tribune.'b'Now the Bundy sons are in jail, and one of them, Ammon, in a statement issued by his lawyers, urged his followers to go home and hug their families. But a subsequent post on the 'b'Facebook page of the Bundy Ranch'b' that has since been deleted issued this call to arms:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cALERT! From Ammon\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Lisa: Ammon would not have called for the patriots to leave. We have lost a life but we are not backing down. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t spill his blood in vain! Hold your ground \xe2\x80\xa6 Ranchers come and stand! \xe2\x80\xa6 Militia come and stand!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The war with the federal government over the West seems far from finished.'b'Iowa Republicans have a lot of choices on Monday, none of whom bear any resemblance to the second coming of Abraham Lincoln.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re not going to pick a paragon. But maybe they could at least get rid of somebody awful. Ted Cruz? Please, Iowa, if you could do anything to knock Ted Cruz out of the race, the country would be grateful. I know he has supporters. But the intensity of loathing among the rest of the population is very strong.'b'In Iowa, Cruz has been attempting to overcome his personality handicap by visiting every single one of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 99 counties. That\xe2\x80\x99s a sort of tradition, among candidates who don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to prioritize. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t even work on television for Alicia Florrick\xe2\x80\x99s husband on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Good Wife.\xe2\x80\x9d Who, admittedly, was under the handicap of having gone to jail for using public funds to hire prostitutes.'b'Probably Cruz felt that since he had failed to endorse Iowa\xe2\x80\x99s most beloved government subsidy \xe2\x80\x94 the ethanol program \xe2\x80\x94 the least he could do was make his way to the town of Fenton, population 279.'b'Cruz spent most of this week\xe2\x80\x99s debate sniping at Marco Rubio \xe2\x80\x94 and Iowa, if you could get rid of both these guys, it\xe2\x80\x99d be appreciated. I know that\xe2\x80\x99s a lot to ask.'b'But Rubio, who used to be sort of the Boy Scout of the pack, has been getting more and more irritating with every passing day. He\xe2\x80\x99s been trying to glom onto Cruz\xe2\x80\x99s religious constituency, although he sounds less like a young evangelist than Eddie Haskell on \xe2\x80\x9cLeave It to Beaver'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'During Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s debate, Rubio was asked about a magazine cover that called him the \xe2\x80\x9cRepublican savior,\xe2\x80\x9d and he quickly announced that the only savior was \xe2\x80\x9cJesus Christ who came down to earth and died for our sins.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cruz and Rubio are both the offspring of immigrants, and both have a stupendous record of duplicity when it comes to the issue of what to do with more recent arrivals. First Cruz loved all legal immigrants, then some not so much. He offered an amendment to allow undocumented immigrants to stay in the country, then claimed it was only a ploy to destroy immigration reform. Rubio went from immigration hard-liner to bipartisan reformer \xe2\x80\x94 cynics say because he wanted to cozy up to Republican donors. Then he changed his mind entirely when the Tea Party got steamed.'b'Donald Trump, of course, was not around for that debate. We are not going to spend one more second discussing him except to point out that at the counter-event he staged for veterans, he introduced his daughter Ivanka, who is very pregnant. If the baby came over the weekend in Iowa, that really would be a kind of coup. Even better than the time Senator Christopher Dodd tried to win Iowa by enrolling his child in a kindergarten there.'b'So many worthy targets for political elimination, but is there a Republican we\xe2\x80\x99d want to see Iowa keep in the game? I do look forward to future Republican debates when we could play a drinking game based on every time Chris Christie mentions 9/11 or says \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6 as a former federal prosecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Probably not 'b'Ben Carson'b'. Granted, he\xe2\x80\x99s a candidate who\xe2\x80\x99s easy to listen to, since it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to hear anything he\xe2\x80\x99s saying. But Carson probably hurt his chances when he responded to a question about Russia by saying \xe2\x80\x9cPutin is a one-horse country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How about Jeb Bush? Bush really picked up some steam when Trump vanished from the stage this week. And he seems to have made peace with the family-dynasty problem by simply embracing it. At the debate he described George I as \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest man alive\xe2\x80\x9d and George II as \xe2\x80\x9cmy brother, who I adore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was also the requisite bouquet to his mother, although nothing weird, like Jeb\xe2\x80\x99s recent announcement in New Hampshire that he loved his mother more than his dad. Who tells a room full of strangers that you like one parent better? Remember the rule about always saying that you love each of your children equally? Works both ways. Even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not true, you stick to the code.'b'How about Rand Paul? He can be a little strange \xe2\x80\x94 we never did get past that day in the Senate when he ranted on about environmentalists ruining his toilet. But at least he\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. And he does do a lot of free eye surgery for the poor. Plus he cuts his own hair. And he\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good at making fun of Ted Cruz.'b'Or John Kasich? He\xe2\x80\x99s the only candidate who brings up religion and then suggests that God might like to see our government spend money on the sick and the mentally ill. And if you wake up on Tuesday and read \xe2\x80\x9cIOWA PICKS KASICH\xe2\x80\x9d you\xe2\x80\x99d know that there was a genuine miracle.'b'The truth, of course, is that someone awful will win, and nobody will go away. There\xe2\x80\x99s still hope. And New Hampshire! Equally cold, but only 10 counties.'b'China has long had one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s worst human rights records because of the way it treats its own citizens. Now, Beijing appears to be reaching beyond its territory and abducting critics from Hong Kong, a semiautonomous city, and from other countries, an alarming expansion of the government\xe2\x80\x99s ruthless determination to crush dissent.'b'The 'b'most recent case'b' involves Li Xin, a Chinese journalist who also worked as a government informant, got fed up with that life and fled China last year, ending up in Thailand. On Monday, his wife said that her husband, a website editor for a popular Chinese newspaper, had been missing from Thailand since Jan. 11 and that he might have been abducted by Chinese agents.'b'In October, 'b'Gui Minhai'b', a book publisher in Hong Kong who was born in China and is a naturalized Swedish citizen, vanished from his apartment in Pattaya, a Thai beach resort. This month, he 'b'reappeared'b' on Chinese state TV and said he returned to China to turn himself in for an old crime. His friends, however, insist Mr. Gui was forcibly taken away. Four other people associated with the same Hong Kong company, Mighty Current Media, which sells books banned in China about Chinese politics and politicians, have also disappeared.'b'In October, Thailand deported two men to China who were registered as refugees; they had been accepted for resettlement in Canada on a claim that they faced persecution if they returned to China. The men, Jiang Yefei and Dong Guanping, were in possession of a United Nations \xe2\x80\x9cprotection letter\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be sent back to a place where their lives can be put in danger,\xe2\x80\x9d a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said. Last summer, Thailand drew condemnation from the United States and others when it deported about 100 Uighur Muslims to China, whose government is repressing separatist-leaning Uighurs in the Xinjiang region.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s alarming that China would ignore international borders to pursue its perceived enemies or work to make sure that critics are denied protection. In the cases affecting residents of Hong Kong, Beijing seems to be ignoring the Basic Law, which guarantees Hong Kong residents rights and freedoms not available to mainland Chinese.'b'In the case of Mr. Gui, a transfer would violate Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty and its criminal law, which prohibits abductions, if Thailand did not approve his return to China. If Thailand approved the transfer and Mr. Gui was not given a chance to contest the decision, it would be considered a forced return and a violation of refugee laws, human rights activists say.'b'Regardless, Sophie Richardson, the China director at Human Rights Watch, says it is obvious that \xe2\x80\x9cincreasingly the Chinese government feels it is entitled to hunt down whomever it wants, wherever it wants\xe2\x80\x9d and that such behavior reflects a blatant disregard for international norms.'b'Thailand\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to assist China, or to at least turn a blind eye, is assumed to be connected to the push Beijing is making to develop closer trade and military ties with Thailand, a longtime treaty ally of the United States.'b'Deputy Secretary of State Antony Blinken raised the abductions issue privately with Chinese officials when he visited Beijing recently. On Friday, the 'b'European Union'b', in some of its strongest criticism ever of China\xe2\x80\x99s human rights behavior, said the disappearance of the Hong Kong publishing employees called \xe2\x80\x9cinto question China\xe2\x80\x99s respect for the rule of law and for its international human rights obligations.\xe2\x80\x9d America and the international community need to keep speaking out as China, once again, is testing how much the world will let it get away with.'b'THE world of polar exploration is mourning the death of Henry Worsley, whose attempt to make the first unsupported traverse of the Antarctic continent failed only 30 miles short of his goal.'b'No stranger to Antarctica, Mr. Worsley, 55, had previously retraced the routes of Sir Ernest Shackleton, who was stopped in 1909 a mere 97 miles short of the South Pole, and of Roald Amundsen, who in 1911-12 led the first team to reach the pole.'b'Mr. Worsley\xe2\x80\x99s latest expedition, his third and most ambitious, was designed to fulfill the dream of Shackleton, his hero, whose 1914-17 bid to make the first Antarctic crossing was doomed when his ship was trapped and crushed in the ice before the team even reached the continent.'b'Outside magazine 'b'hailed him'b' as \xe2\x80\x9cone of the world\xe2\x80\x99s great polar explorers.\xe2\x80\x9d But one could argue that Mr. Worsley\xe2\x80\x99s effort had nothing to do with exploration.'b'During the so-called golden age of Antarctic exploration (roughly 1897-1917), Shackleton, Amundsen, Robert Falcon Scott and Douglas Mawson discovered new land every day as they pushed their teams into unknown terrain. Those leaders, to be sure, had other motives: the colonial impulse to claim land for their countries or the goal of doing science. But what drove them to the edge of survival was the unquenchable urge to discover what was there. At the time, Antarctica was a virtual blank on the map.'b'Today, the continent has been completely mapped. Adventurers strive for \xe2\x80\x9cfirsts\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 fastest times from A to B, or long-distance treks with a minimum of support. The goal is not discovery, but setting records.'b'Jaded observers lament the extinction of all blanks on the map of the earth. Their gloom, however, is unwarranted. True exploration is alive and well today.'b'Henry Worsley\xe2\x80\x99s solo journey was a grueling and perilous one, as he faced the daily threat of hidden crevasses and violent storms that could trap him in his tent. It was a feat of uncommon endurance, as he hauled a sledge that initially weighed more than 300 pounds for 71 days across 913 miles of snow and ice. But he followed a well-planned course across 'b'terra cognita'b'. Nothing he found was new.'b'The trend toward record setting has overtaken what used to be called exploration. Climbers ascend the highest peaks on each continent faster than anybody else before them. Wingsuit fliers strive for record times aloft. Transocean rowers vie to cover the greatest distance possible.'b'Today\xe2\x80\x99s polar adventurers, moreover, inevitably hedge the risk with constant communication to support teams ready to come to their rescue. Mr. Worsley sent his message of resignation to the world via satellite phone, quoting Shackleton, who had lamented having \xe2\x80\x9cshot his bolt\xe2\x80\x9d before reaching the South Pole. But in 1909, when Shackleton and his men turned around, they had no one but themselves to count on to get back to their base camp. In 1912, Scott and his four companions died in a storm on their desperate return journey.'b'Mr. Worsley\xe2\x80\x99s call started an airlift rescue. He died not on the ice, but in a hospital in southern Chile when doctors could not reverse a fatal bout of peritonitis. His death was reported last week.'b'These epic efforts at \xe2\x80\x9cfirsts\xe2\x80\x9d seem to have obscured the true exploration that is taking place around the globe. Cavers are in the middle of their own golden age, as the deepest and largest underground grottoes remain undiscovered. In serious caving, there are no hourly communications by satellite phone, no rescues by plane or helicopter. No wonder, then, that the best cavers are uninterested in speed records or endurance feats per se. They\xe2\x80\x99re busy trying to find out what lies underground.'b'The 'b'cenotes of Yucat\xc3\xa1n'b', still mostly unexplored, have galvanized some of the best cave divers to prowl through these nightmarish subterranean labyrinths. Cave diving is arguably the most dangerous pursuit in terrestrial adventure today.'b'The world\xe2\x80\x99s most unnavigable rivers also await their first descents. Rafters have yet to brave, for instance, the headwaters of the Heilongjiang or Songhuajiang Rivers in China. I was privileged to participate in the first (and to this date, only) attempt to raft the Tua and Purari Rivers in Papua New Guinea in 1983. Our party turned back in the face of what looked like suicidal rapids far short of the river\xe2\x80\x99s terminus.'b'In terms of mountaineering, the news media tends to focus ad nauseam on Everest. Yet there are scores of unclimbed peaks in Alaska, Greenland and western China. Just last fall, two of the world\xe2\x80\x99s best climbers, Conrad Anker and David Lama, threw themselves at Lunag Ri, an unclimbed peak on the border of Nepal and Tibet. Extreme cold and fiendish granite walls thwarted their boldest efforts. The world\xe2\x80\x99s highest unclimbed peak, the 24,830-foot Gangkhar Puensum, is protected by Bhutan\xe2\x80\x99s ban on climbing on the country\xe2\x80\x99s sacred mountains.'b'Climbers, like cavers and river runners, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about whether their quests are \xe2\x80\x9cuseful.\xe2\x80\x9d It is the pursuit of knowledge and adventure that animates them.'b'No part of the globe is more unexplored than the depths of the great oceans. The Mariana Trench in the western Pacific enfolds a slot-shaped valley more than 36,000 feet below the surface, the deepest point known on earth.

But this situation is not without historical precedent. Europe has accepted large numbers of immigrants before. The issue this time is political. It has little to do with the absolute numbers of asylum seekers. The problem lies with the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s dysfunctional asylum system, which encourages countries to pass refugees on like hot potatoes, and places the burden of registering and processing asylum seekers on a small number of countries on the Union\xe2\x80\x99s border.'b'An intractable gridlock prevents a common response. On the one end of the spectrum stands Germany\xe2\x80\x99s chancellor, Angela Merkel, who has stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to political asylum [has] no limits on the number of asylum seekers.\xe2\x80\x9d On the other extreme are some European leaders who refuse to grant asylum to any claimants, however small the numbers. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way to eliminate risks,\xe2\x80\x9d said Prime Minister Robert Fico of Slovakia, is to steer away from \xe2\x80\x9cany decision that could lead to the emergence of a compact Muslim community in Slovakia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'However, unless the European Union arrives at a unified response, the border controls now dividing Schengen countries will remain, leaving a permanent dent in the European construction. But there are ways out of this seemingly desperate situation.'b'For one, the quota system, proposed by the European Commission, could be made flexible. In 1997, the Yale University legal scholar Peter Schuck proposed a system of tradable refugee quotas. The European Union would still have to agree on the total number of migrants to whom it is willing to grant asylum, and on how they would be distributed among the member states. But the quota market would allow countries such as Slovakia or Hungary, whose leaders refuse to accept any refugees, to \xe2\x80\x9cbribe\xe2\x80\x9d others to carry their obligations on their behalf, putting a concrete price tag on the unwillingness of Central Europeans to help.'b'If such a market with refugees appears dehumanizing, consider that some version of it already exists between Europeans and Turkey. In November, the European Union promised Turkey 3 billion euros in aid, alongside various political favors, in exchange for Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to keep refugees from fleeing to Europe.'b'But an explicit market in refugee quotas is not the only possible fix to the current crisis, according to two researchers at the University of Oxford, Alex Teytelboym and Will Jones. To bring the chaotic influx of refugees under control, the European Union could also create a centralized \xe2\x80\x9cmatching system,\xe2\x80\x9d which would involve none of the cash payments that are often seen as repugnant. Originally developed by economists such as the Nobel Laureate Alvin E. Roth, matching systems are used to allocate kidney donors to patients (the New England Program for Kidney Exchange) or to match medical students with hospital residency programs (the National Resident Matching Program).'b'From the standpoint of the refugees \xe2\x80\x94 most of whom arrive in Greece or Italy \xe2\x80\x94 the appeal of pushing further into the European Union lies in the fact that they are forced into a lottery by being able to apply for asylum in only one European Union country. In contrast, a matching system would offer Syrian refugees in Turkey and elsewhere a route to asylum in the European Union in which getting to a particular country (say, Germany) would be much less important. Applicants would rank European Union countries by order of preference and submit that ordering to a central clearinghouse.'b'Some countries, such as Germany or Sweden, would likely remain oversubscribed. But because applicants would be submitting a complete ordering of European Union countries they are applying for, they could still be matched with, say, their second, or third choice, instead of being rejected outright.'b'The European Union member states would in turn specify how many and what refugees they are willing to accept. Earlier in 2015, some European governments, including that of Mr. Fico, expressed interest in accepting refugees \xe2\x80\x94 as long as they were Christian. In principle, the matching system could accommodate such preferences, in addition to less controversial ones, concerning education, skills or languages spoken.'b'Unlike the quota system proposed by the European Commission, the matching system would neither coerce countries to take in refugees against their will, nor would it require an European Union-wide agreement over the total number of asylum slots offered by the Union. Instead, countries would be free to determine the minimum and maximum numbers of asylums they are willing to grant.'b'Some countries, such as Hungary or Slovakia, could even choose to free ride and not accept any refugees without necessarily jeopardizing the matching mechanism. Of course, the numbers would have to add to a meaningfully large figure for the system to provide an alternative to illicit migration to the European Union.'b'Governments would not just control the numbers but also the characteristics of refugees that they want to accept, which would place them firmly in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat. As a result, the mechanism would limit the space for political grandstanding and for populist backlashes of the kind seen across Europe last year. Those reactions were largely results of the quota system being perceived as an inflexible, top-down imposition of an unaccountable European elite.'b'The matching system is not magic. It would not solve the conflict in Syria, nor would it relieve Europeans of their humanitarian duties toward asylum seekers fleeing the conflict. But it would be a marked improvement over the status quo. It would provide the European Union with a tool that would enable it to deal collectively with the refugee crisis of the current magnitude, in spite of substantial differences in opinion existing among its members, and without setting in motion the centrifugal forces that risk destroying the European project altogether.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 All the world\xe2\x80\x99s seas are bedeviled by global warming, pollution and overfishing, but the Mediterranean and the 20-plus nations that ring it face another threat: A rising flood of invasive marine species flowing through the Suez Canal.'b'On Aug. 6, 2015, over the objections of environmentalists and the reservations of many economists, the canal\xe2\x80\x99s latest expansion opened to shipping. The new 22-mile channel will double the canal\xe2\x80\x99s capacity, allowing 97 ships to pass through each day. It also opens a wider path for invasive species from the Indian and Pacific Oceans to flood through the Red Sea into the Mediterranean.'b'Once they\xe2\x80\x99re in, there\xe2\x80\x99s no way to get them out, and the changes they bring are irreversible. Israeli scientists have identified more than 450 alien species of fish, invertebrates and algae that are not part of the Mediterranean\xe2\x80\x99s natural ecosystem. Several pose public health hazards, while others threaten fisheries and tourism and denude underwater ecosystems, greatly reducing biodiversity.'b'Egyptian authorities say the $8.5 billion project will reduce bottlenecks and increase toll revenue from $5.3 billion to $13.2 billion a year by 2023. But these benefits come at the cost of continuing environmental degradation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe recent doubling of the canal will decimate coastal ecosystems with dire implications for the regional economy and human health. We can\xe2\x80\x99t continue to overlook this threat,\xe2\x80\x9d warns Dr. Bella Galil, a senior scientist at Israel\xe2\x80\x99s National Institute of Oceanography.'b'It can take generations, she says, for an alien species to expand its range. The presence of Red Sea fish in the Levant Basin, for example, was not recorded until 1902, more than three decades after the canal first opened in 1869. Subsequent waves have followed major canal expansions in 1980 and in 2010. The eastern Mediterranean, mere miles from the canal\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, has been hardest hit, and experts from Turkey, Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Lebanon say this invasion has drastically altered fisheries.'b'In the 1970s, according to Dr. Dor Edelist, a marine ecologist at the University of Haifa, invasive species constituted 21 percent of Israeli trawler catch; today, more than half are alien. In the first decade of this century, Israel\xe2\x80\x99s Mediterranean fishery brought in $14 million to $26 million a year. Today, it\xe2\x80\x99s about $16 million, of which $6 million to $10 million are invasive species. Some are edible, like the goldband goatfish, but it has replaced the native species, red mullet. Gone too are native food fish like European hake and porgies. Turkish and Lebanese fisheries report similar losses.'b'Putting a precise figure on the economic impact is difficult. Standard commercial fisheries statistics tell how much fish is caught and sold, but fishermen are notorious for underreporting their catch. And no one is tracking the economic loss from season to season as commercial species collapse or as environmental degradation reduces tourism.'b'Three alien species have been particularly destructive. Rabbit fish have devoured algal forests, leaving wide areas of bare rock and undermining the complex ecosystems of the Levant Basin.'b'A more recent arrival is the poisonous silverside puffer fish, native to the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Puffer fish eat 20 percent to 33 percent of fish caught on long-line hooks and often chew through a trawler\xe2\x80\x99s nets, according to Aylin Ulman, a doctoral student at the University of Pavia, who studies Turkish fisheries. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere gill nets used to last 15 years, puffer fish cause so much damage that nets have to be replaced in just a few months,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Researchers say Greek fishermen face the same issues in the Aegean and off Crete. Among other prey, they devour such staple foods as squid, octopus and cuttlefish. Off the coast of Cyprus, the octopus catch has plummeted from 175 tons per year in 2001 to below 50 tons in 2009, according to the Sea Around Us, an environmental fisheries program run by the University of British Columbia.'b'Another voracious and painfully venomous predator, the nomad jellyfish, entered the Mediterranean in the 1970s. Now they form large swarms every summer, washing up on shores, endangering beachgoers and divers, blocking the water-intake pipes of power and desalinization plants. Swarms have reached the Straits of Sicily and are endangering Atlantic bluefin tuna eggs, threatening a fishery already on the verge of collapse.'b'Though we can\xe2\x80\x99t remove invasive species, we do have the engineering expertise to stem the migration. The Panama Canal, which opened to shipping in 1914, offers an example of what might be accomplished. It operates a series of locks that function like sets of double doors, allowing ships to pass while making it more difficult for alien species to follow. Moreover, the fresh water of Gatun Lake, which forms a major part of the canal complex, provides a 21-mile barrier that impedes the migration of most saltwater species.'b'The Suez Canal once had its own salinity barrier, known as the Bitter Lakes. Previous expansions and agricultural wastewater dumped into the canal flushed it away, but recreating it could be cost-effective. Installing locks for the Suez Canal, located in a much simpler physical environment than the mountainous Panamanian region, should be easier and less costly than the $3.2 billion the Panama authorities expect to pay for modernized lock equipment.'b'Scientists and environmentalists have appealed to the European Commission to install locks and salinity barriers in the Suez Canal and have requested an environmental impact assessment. Despite Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that the information would be provided by May, European Union officials say they have still not received a definitive report. But in discussions last October conducted by the United Nations Environment Program, the Egyptians reportedly said they would not sign an updated United Nations Mediterranean Action Plan unless language stating that invasive species are coming through the Suez Canal was removed. The MAP draft decision, with the language regarding the Suez Canal in brackets, goes to the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean for review in February.'b'Observers say that Brussels doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to lean too hard on Egypt because President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi is cooperating in dealing with the refugee crisis. Many European Union member states with their own national interests in the Mediterranean see the Suez expansion as a sovereign decision by the Egyptian government and are loath to interfere.'b'But Egypt and its neighbors are losing sight of the big picture. For Egypt, with its large underemployed population, managing the fishing industry more wisely would employ more people and have greater long-term economic benefits than building expensive canal infrastructure that is vulnerable to a volatile global economy.'b'So, how can these competing interests be resolved? The problem may require new ideas and neutral leadership. In the mid-2000s, overfishing and environmental degradation was ruining fisheries off California. The Nature Conservancy bought up boats and licenses and leased these back to fishermen willing to employ more sustainable methods and use reporting software to help the NGO develop baseline data on the fishing stocks themselves. The result: Local fishermen are still fishing, and fish stocks are coming back. The program has been copied by several New England fisheries.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s surely a creative solution for the Mediterranean\xe2\x80\x99s problems, and the place to start is by rebuilding salinity barriers in the Suez Canal. As we become more aware of the risks to our planet, we must remember that human beings, by nature, are not only competitive \xe2\x80\x94 we\xe2\x80\x99re also cooperative.'b'DES MOINES \xe2\x80\x94 IN the final, furious days of campaigning here, it was sometimes hard to tell whether this state\xe2\x80\x99s Republicans were poised to vote for a president or a preacher, a commander or a crusader.'b'The references to religion were expansive. The talk of it was excessive. A few candidates didn\xe2\x80\x99t just profess the supposed purity of their own faith. They questioned rivals\xe2\x80\x99 piety, with Ted Cruz inevitably leading the way.'b'A rally of his devolved into an inquisition of Donald Trump.

Hours after the marriage, her father and uncle sweet-talked her into their car and took her to a spot along a riverbank to murder her for her defiance \xe2\x80\x94 an \xe2\x80\x9chonor killing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'First they beat Saba, then her uncle held her as her own father pointed a pistol at her head and pulled the trigger. Blood spewed, Saba collapsed and her father and uncle packed her body into a large sack and threw it into the river to sink. They then drove away, thinking they had restored the family\xe2\x80\x99s good name.'b'Incredibly, Saba was unconscious but alive. She had jerked her head as the gun went off, and the bullet tore through the left side of her face but didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill her. The river water revived her, and she clawed her way out of the sack and crawled onto land. She staggered toward a gasoline station, and someone called for help.'b'About every 90 minutes, an honor killing unfolds somewhere in the world, usually in a Muslim country. Pakistan alone has more than 1,000 a year, and the killers often go unpunished.'b'Watching the documentary about Saba, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'A Girl in the River'b': The Price of Forgiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d I kept thinking that just as in the 19th century the central moral challenge for the world was slavery, and in the 20th century it was totalitarianism, in this century the foremost moral issue is the abuse and oppression that is the lot of so many women and girls around the world.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether \xe2\x80\x9cA Girl in the River\xe2\x80\x9d will win an Oscar in its category, short subject documentary, but it is already making a difference. Citing the film, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan has 'b'promised to change the country\xe2\x80\x99s laws'b' so as to crack down on honor killings.'b'Saba\xe2\x80\x99s story underscores how the existing law lets people literally get away with murder when honor is the excuse. After doctors saved Saba\xe2\x80\x99s life \xe2\x80\x94 as police officers guarded the door so her father didn\xe2\x80\x99t return to finish the job \xe2\x80\x94 she was determined to prosecute her father and uncle.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey should be shot in public in an open market,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the filmmaker, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy, \xe2\x80\x9cso that such a thing never happens again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The police arrested Saba\xe2\x80\x99s father, Maqsood, and the uncle, Muhammad, and their defense was that they did the right thing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe took away our honor,\xe2\x80\x9d Maqsood said from his jail cell. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you put one drop of piss in a gallon of milk, the whole thing gets destroyed. That\xe2\x80\x99s what she has done. \xe2\x80\xa6 So I said, \xe2\x80\x98No, I will kill you myself.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Maqsood said that after shooting Saba he went home and told his wife, \xe2\x80\x9cI have gone and killed your daughter.\xe2\x80\x9d He added: \xe2\x80\x9cMy wife cried. What else could she do? I am her husband. She is just my wife.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perpetrators of honor killings often are not prosecuted because Pakistani law allows families of victims to forgive a killing. So a man kills his daughter, the rest of the family forgives him, and he\xe2\x80\x99s off the hook.'b'Tremendous pressure was applied to Saba by community elders to pardon her father and uncle. In the end, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s older brother \xe2\x80\x94 the head of her new family \xe2\x80\x94 told her to forgive and move on. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no other way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have to live in the same neighborhood.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Saba complied, and her father and uncle were released from prison. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter this incident, everyone says I am more respected,\xe2\x80\x9d her father boasted. \xe2\x80\x9cI can proudly say that for generations to come none of my descendants will ever think of doing what Saba did.\xe2\x80\x9d The families still live near each other, although the father insists he will not try again to kill Saba.'b'The way to reduce honor killings is to end the impunity. Saba 'b'tried to do her part'b', and let\xe2\x80\x99s hope Prime Minister 'b'Sharif does indeed'b' end the legal system of forgiveness.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to start a national discourse about the issue,\xe2\x80\x9d says Obaid-Chinoy, the film\xe2\x80\x99s director. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil we send people to jail and make examples of them, honor killings will continue.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Since 9/11, the United States has spent billions of dollars reshaping Afghanistan and Pakistan with the military toolbox; I suspect we would have achieved more if we had relied to a greater extent on the education and women\xe2\x80\x99s empowerment toolboxes.'b'A starting point would be to encourage governments to protect teenage girls from fathers who want to murder them. Chipping away at this broad pattern of gender injustice is in the interest of all of us. It is our century\xe2\x80\x99s great unfinished business.'b'THE Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus, is the most revered woman in the Christian tradition. In the history of art, she appears almost as frequently as Jesus himself. But for the past 80 years, one of the oldest paintings of her may have been hiding in plain sight.'b'At the Yale University Art Gallery hang wall paintings from one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s oldest churches. Buried by the middle of the third century, this house-church from eastern Syria had images of Jesus, Peter and David. The gallery showcases a well-preserved procession of veiled women that once surrounded its baptistery, a room for Christian initiation.'b'Off to the side, seldom noticed among the likes of Jesus and Peter, stands a different wall fragment, faded but still discernible: a woman bent over a well. Holding the rope of her vessel, she looks out at the viewer or perhaps over her shoulder, seemingly startled in the act of drawing water.'b'Who is she? The museum\xe2\x80\x99s identification is certainly plausible: \xe2\x80\x9cThe painting most likely depicts a scene from the encounter between Christ (not shown) and a woman from Samaria,\xe2\x80\x9d as recorded in the Gospel of John. But historians also know that the Samaritan Woman, a repentant sinner who conversed at length with Jesus, was usually depicted in dialogue with him. This woman appears to be alone.'b'Is it possible that a painting from a building excavated in 1932 and publicized around the world has not been correctly identified? These murals come from the eastern frontier of the Roman Empire, a military outpost variously called \xe2\x80\x9cDura\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cEuropos\xe2\x80\x9d in antiquity.'b'Perched high above the Euphrates in the region that is now called Deir ez-Zor, the ruins of Dura-Europos have yielded more distinct artifacts than almost any other ancient archaeological site: an intact Roman shield, a lavishly painted synagogue, a temple to the gods of nearby Palmyra. It is the \xe2\x80\x9cPompeii of the Syrian desert,\xe2\x80\x9d declared Michael Rostovtzeff, director of Yale\xe2\x80\x99s excavations at the site.'b'But no Vesuvius buried this Pompeii. Portions of Dura-Europos were buried intentionally, to bolster a rampart against a 'b'Sasanian'b' army invading from the east in the 250s. The misfortune of the Roman garrison, which lost the battle, would become good fortune for historians. The earthen rampart sealed cross-sections of many buildings, including the house-church, so that both contents and date were secure.'b'The church\xe2\x80\x99s painted baptistery remains a unique discovery. Outside of funerary contexts, such as the catacombs in Rome, there are precious few Christian paintings from before Emperor Constantine\xe2\x80\x99s conversion to Christianity in the fourth century. These also offer a glimpse into the beliefs and rituals of Syrian Christians, a community currently in peril.'b'While the Samaritan Woman at the Well was a respected biblical figure for early Christians, there was actually a more prominent \xe2\x80\x9cwoman at the well\xe2\x80\x9d in Syria: the Virgin Mary during the Annunciation, when an angelic visitor informed her of her miraculous pregnancy. Where does this episode take place? The setting of the canonical account, in the Gospel of Luke, is not specified. But the second-century biography of Mary\xe2\x80\x99s early life, usually called the Protevangelium of James, describes how one day, during a break from her work, \xe2\x80\x9cshe took the pitcher and went forth to draw water, and behold, a voice said: \xe2\x80\x98Hail, you are highly favored, the Lord is with you, blessed are you among women.\xe2\x80\x99 And she looked around on the right and on the left to see from where this voice could have come.\xe2\x80\x9d During this first encounter, at a well or spring, the angel was heard but not seen. Mary appeared to be alone.'b'Most people, when they imagine the Annunciation, have in mind some western Renaissance masterpiece: a studious, cloistered Mary welcoming the angel from the comfort of home. But Byzantine images of the scene, though coming centuries later than the figure from Dura-Europos, bear an arresting formal resemblance to it. The brilliant illumination in James of Kokkinobaphos\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHomilies on the Virgin\xe2\x80\x9d and the grand mosaic from the Byzantine monastery at Chora in Istanbul both demonstrate the importance in eastern Christianity of placing Mary at the well. Some manuscripts even depict this type among illuminations of the Gospel of Luke itself, showing that artists preferred the evocative iconographic traditions of the noncanonical text over the unspecified setting of the canonical one. At Chora, Mary\xe2\x80\x99s figure can also be contrasted with the portrayal of the Samaritan Woman in the same church, who looks across a well at a pictured Jesus.'b'The woman at Dura-Europos has yet more secrets to reveal. Archival photographs and drawings made by the archaeologists on site show that the supposed absence behind the female figure is not totally silent \xe2\x80\x94 it speaks a couple of lines. That is to say, a field sketch of the wall done \xe2\x80\x9cto show additional details\xe2\x80\x9d depicts two painted lines touching the woman\xe2\x80\x99s back, along with a kind of starburst on the front of her torso, features described as \xe2\x80\x9cunexplained\xe2\x80\x9d in the archaeological report. But with the new interpretation of the figure, in connection with the Eastern iconography that came later, the lines invite a rather evident meaning. They appear to represent a motion toward the woman\xe2\x80\x99s body and a spark of activity within it, as if something invisible were approaching and entering her \xe2\x80\x94 an incarnation.'b'If correct, this woman at a well is the oldest securely datable image of the Virgin Mary. Devotees of the Roman catacombs may demur, since a few female figures there are often presented as Mary. But these are challenging to date with certainty, and many scholars argue that the proposed examples have insufficiently specific iconographic signifiers.'b'Identifying the oldest image of Mary isn\xe2\x80\x99t an end in itself. Reidentifying this woman helps us to ponder anew the distinctive emphases of early Christians in Syria, who in this baptistery celebrated salvation through images of marriage, pregnancy and birth \xe2\x80\x94 as much or more than through participation in a ritualized death. This is not to undermine the power of Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 passion and resurrection accounts, but rather to rebalance the perspective of modern Western viewers, looking back after centuries of art focused on the cross. In the extant art from Dura-Europos, we see the hope of new spiritual birth, but the death of Christ is not pictured once.'b'Today the paintings from this church are safe. But further opportunities to understand early Syrian Christianity are slipping away, as the archaeological sites of Deir ez-Zor are being systematically plundered under the auspices of the Islamic State. According to satellite images and reports from the ground, the looting pits at Dura-Europos are innumerable. Even while the human tragedy of the refugee crisis justifiably occupies our attention, the destruction of cultural heritage tells a parallel narrative.'b'Images from this ancient Syrian church are thus much more than museum pieces. They illuminate a people and heritage that need salvation \xe2\x80\x94 and not the kind of salvation found in a baptistery.'b'ONE of the puzzles of the 2016 campaign, unexpectedly defined by the ascent of a billionaire reality TV star and a septuagenarian Vermont socialist, is 'b'why now? 'b'Yes, voters are angry, yes, they\xe2\x80\x99re exhausted and disgusted and cynical about everything. But why is everything boiling over in this particular cycle, in this presidential campaign?'b'Consider: The economic picture is better than it was in 2012, when Republican primary voters settled for Mitt Romney and an incumbent president was re-elected pretty easily. (In both Iowa and New Hampshire, the unemployment rate is currently under 4 percent.) The foreign policy picture is grim in certain ways, but America isn\xe2\x80\x99t trapped in a casualty-heavy quagmire the way we were in 2004, when Democratic voters played it safe with John Kerry and George W. Bush won re-election.'b'As Michael Grunwald 'b'argued'b' recently in Politico, the worst-case scenarios of the post-Great Recession era haven\xe2\x80\x99t materialized. Obamacare is limping along without an imminent death spiral, and health care costs aren\xe2\x80\x99t rising as fast as feared. The deficit has fallen a bit, and inflation is extraordinarily low. The stock market is wobbly, but we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had a double-dip recession.'b'On the cultural front, out-of-wedlock births are no longer rising. Abortion rates have fallen. Illegal immigration rates are down.'b'The state of the union isn\xe2\x80\x99t all that one might hope, but it could clearly be a whole lot worse.'b'So what are Trumpistas and Bern-feelers rebelling against?'b'One answer might be that they\xe2\x80\x99re fed up with exactly this \xe2\x80\x94 the politics of \xe2\x80\x9cit could be worse,\xe2\x80\x9d of stagnation and muddling through. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t revolting against abject failure, or deep and swift decline. They\xe2\x80\x99re rebelling against decadence.'b'Now it may sound absurd to cast a figure like Donald Trump, the much-married prince of tinsel and pasteboard, as a scourge of decadence rather than its embodiment.'b'But don\xe2\x80\x99t just think about the word in moral or aesthetic terms. Think of it as a useful way of describing a society that\xe2\x80\x99s wealthy, powerful, technologically proficient \xe2\x80\x94 and yet seemingly unable to 'b'advance'b' in the way that its citizens once took for granted. A society where people have fewer children and hold diminished expectations for the future, where institutions don\xe2\x80\x99t work particularly well but can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be effectively reformed, where growth is slow and technological progress disappoints. A society that fights to a stalemate in its foreign wars, even as domestic debates repeat themselves without any resolution. A society disillusioned with existing religions and ideologies, but lacking new sources of meaning to take their place.'b'This is how many Americans, many Westerners, experience their civilization in the early years of the 21st century. And both Trump and Bernie Sanders, in their very different ways, are telling us that we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to settle for it anymore.'b'With Trump, the message is crude, explicit, deliberately over the top. 'b'Make America Great Again'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will have so much winning if I get elected that you may get bored with the winning.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But it resonates because the diagnosis resonates \xe2\x80\x94 especially with older Americans, who grew up amid the post-World War II boom, the vaulting optimism of the space age, the years when big government and big business were seen as effective and patriotic rather than sclerotic and corrupt. Trump is offering nostalgia, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not a true reactionary\xe2\x80\x99s lament. He wants to take us back to a time when the 'b'future'b' seemed great, amazing, fantastic.'b'Likewise Sanders, except that in his case the glorious future is more midcentury Scandinavia than space age America. After Obamacare became law it seemed to many people that the welfare state project was 'b'basically complete,'b' that the future of American liberalism mostly involved tweaking entitlements around the edges to keep them solvent. But Sanders is telling liberals, younger liberals especially, that the heroic age of liberalism isn\xe2\x80\x99t over yet, that they can have a welfare state that\xe2\x80\x99s far more amazing and fantastic than the one their forefathers constructed.'b'The fact that both of these messages \xe2\x80\x94 Trump\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMake America great again\xe2\x80\x9d and Bernie\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not socialism?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 involve essentially recycled visions of the future is a sign of how hard it is for a decadent society to escape the trap of repetition.'b'But more important, the fact that both men are promising the implausible or the impossible \xe2\x80\x94 and the fact that Trump is openly contemptuous of our ragged republican norms \xe2\x80\x94 is a reminder that there are worse things than decadence, grimmer possibilities for the future than drift and repetition.'b'The disappointment and impatience that people feel in a decadent era is legitimate, even admirable. But the envy of more heroic moments, the desire to just 'b'do something 'b'to prove your society\xe2\x80\x99s vitality \xe2\x80\x94 Invade Iraq to remake the Middle East! Open Germany\xe2\x80\x99s borders! Elect Trump or Sanders president! \xe2\x80\x94 can be a very dangerous sensibility.'b'There are pathways up from decadence. But there are more roads leading down.'b'Rutland, Vt. \xe2\x80\x94 BERNIE SANDERS gained his largest margin of victory as a member of the House of Representatives the same year that Vermont experienced its fiercest conservative backlash. In the wake of a bruising fight over civil unions in 2000, Republicans regained the Vermont House and gave the popular Democratic governor, Howard Dean, his severest test.'b'The independent socialist candidate for Congress won 69 percent of the vote, and in that result is the paradox of Bernie Sanders.'b'This state was having a grass-roots upheaval that year. The landscape filled with signs, in ominous black print, demanding that voters \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Take Back Vermont'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Letters to the editor flooded the state\xe2\x80\x99s newspapers repudiating the first step toward same-sex marriage. And Mr. Sanders, a supporter of civil unions, but not yet of marriage, overwhelmed his opposition.'b'John L. Franco Jr., a longtime Sanders ally, says Vermont is an \xe2\x80\x9coff-the-grid\xe2\x80\x9d state and Bernie Sanders has always been an off-the-grid politician. Now, somewhat improbably, Mr. Sanders is taking that off-the-grid strategy to the biggest grid there is: a quest for the White House. How well will what works in Vermont translate?'b'Bernie Sanders arrived in our state as part of an influx of newcomers who brought with them an abundance of new energy and new ideas. The newcomers included Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, of future ice cream fame, and a young doctor named Howard Dean.'b'Mr. Sanders brought with him ideas about economic justice and the interests of ordinary people. His speeches from the 1970s are little different from those he is delivering today.'b'He shocked Vermont and won national attention in 1981 when he was first elected mayor of Burlington. It is the state\xe2\x80\x99s largest city, though with only 42,000 people today it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to call it large. The old Democratic Party establishment dominated its politics. Mr. Sanders was long associated with a raffish antiwar party called Liberty Union. He won by 10 votes, and the avowed socialist took office as mayor the same year that Ronald Reagan began his presidency.'b'As mayor he trained his anti-establishment ideas on specific city problems, so he seemed less ideological and more of a pragmatist.'b'Today, Mr. Sanders is being cast as the idealist in the Democratic primary, and it\xe2\x80\x99s unclear how much importance will be \xe2\x80\x94 or should be \xe2\x80\x94 attached to his record as a hard-nosed mayor. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to push a tax package past the merchants of Burlington and quite another to take on the vast forces arrayed in Washington.'b'Garrison Nelson, who has been a political-science professor at the University of Vermont since 1968, says Mr. Sanders always oriented toward the interests of individual workers. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s an evangelical leftist,\xe2\x80\x9d Professor Nelson says.'b'From the beginning, that set him apart from the old-school Democrats who dominated Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s small cities \xe2\x80\x94 Barre, Winooski, Rutland \xe2\x80\x94 where Italian, French-Canadian, Irish and Polish immigrants had come to work in the mills and quarries. It also set him apart from many of the new-style liberals who arrived in the state in the 1960s and 1970s, who concerned themselves mainly with the environment, energy, women\xe2\x80\x99s rights and education.'b'Mr. Sanders fell into no camp but his own. By 'b'running for mayor'b', he challenged the old boys\xe2\x80\x99 network that supported the incumbent Democrat, Gordon Paquette, alienating the party for years.'b'Later, when he decided to run for Congress, he knew he had to broaden his appeal. Vincent Illuzzi, a Republican state senator for 32 years, represented two counties in the Northeast Kingdom, the state\xe2\x80\x99s poorest, remotest region, where voters are more conservative. He says that over the years Mr. Sanders has spent more time there than any other member of Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s congressional delegation.'b'When Mr. Sanders showed up, he talked about how the banks or the cable companies were ripping people off, how the government was letting veterans down. He was there to help workers in their bid to unionize the local furniture mill.'b'He was not there to push same-sex marriage, and he was not going to emphasize those environmental issues that might cost a logger his job. And he definitely was not going to argue for gun control among voters who depended on their rifles to put meat on the table.'b'If Mr. Sanders had come across as a liberal, he would not have done as well as he did among voters in the Northeast Kingdom. But, as Professor Nelson says, he was not a liberal; he was a \xe2\x80\x9cpopulist prophet\xe2\x80\x9d who was able to capture the sense of unfairness that working people felt in their bones.'b'Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s career advanced with the benefit of some lucky accidents. For his first victory as mayor, he benefited from divisions among Democrats that stole votes from the incumbent.'b'He ran for Congress in 1988 against Vermont\xe2\x80\x99s Republican lieutenant governor, Peter Smith, and a Democratic legislator who failed to mount an effective challenge. Mr. Sanders ended up as a strong second-place finisher.'b'By 1990 Mr. Sanders was ready to take on Mr. Smith again, and Democratic opponents essentially opted out. Mr. Sanders won 56 percent of the vote.'b'Mr. Sanders practices the same personal politics that other politicians do. His is a well-known face not just in the Northeast Kingdom, but at Labor Day picnics and Memorial Day parades around the state, marching among the horse-drawn floats.'b'In Vermont, Mr. Sanders draws support from across the political spectrum. How well will that serve him with a national audience? His work for Vermont farmers enables him to talk comfortably with farmers in Iowa. On the other hand, he has had to modify his laissez-faire views on guns in the face of the anti-gun sentiment within the larger Democratic constituency.'b'It is probably his embrace of the role of anti-establishment outsider that has won him support at home from the pickup-truck voters \xe2\x80\x94 the tradesmen, farmers, loggers \xe2\x80\x94 who have been willing to overlook his liberal views on issues such as gay rights. Yet working-class voters in other parts of the country may not back him in the way that young people and progressives appear to be doing. And Vermont is one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s whitest states. Mr. Sanders has a long record of support for civil rights, but he lacks deep engagement with the African-American community.'b'Do Vermonters want Bernie Sanders to be president?

Unlike some others, Mr. Sanders deploys his not for showmanship, but on behalf of veterans or striking phone workers. Their causes have always been the substance of his career.

The problem isn\xe2\x80\x99t one of accolades. The problem is diversity in moviemaking. If you want more people of color feted at the end of the year, then hire them during the year. From the top down, the studios are, for the most part, run by white men and their white male underlings who make movies aimed at white audiences with white actors hired through their white managers and agents.'b'Of course there are many exceptions, but if Hollywood doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like its current white-bread image, don\xe2\x80\x99t change the camera angle. Shoot a different picture. Hire more people of color. Hire more women as directors. Make better movies. The need is not for a more diversified Oscar slate. It\xe2\x80\x99s for a more diversified industry.'b'PETER WORTMANN'b'New York'b'To the Editor: I was surprised to read the harsh comments leveled at the Academy with regard to its response to protests over two consecutive years of all-white nominees for acting awards. There does not exist some external objective measure of quality for such arts as literature and film. A person\xe2\x80\x99s race, socioeconomic class and exposure to different cultural products all influence what he or she finds valuable in a performance or movie.'b'It is therefore not surprising that a white man (I am one) may not find as much value and meaning in \xe2\x80\x9cStraight Outta Compton\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCreed,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, as a person with a greater historical and personal connection to these stories. Similarly, a large bloc of votes may go to the excellent country singer on the TV show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Voice\xe2\x80\x9d from voters in the American South and Midwest. Does this mean that the urban singer is not as talented?'b'People argue that, going forward, minority Oscar winners will be tainted because they were chosen for reasons of political correctness. One could just as easily argue the opposite: White winners these past few years are tainted because they won unfairly over minorities. Both arguments, I think, have equal validity.'b'ANDREW BLECKNER'b'Princeton Junction, N.J.'b'To the Editor: American cinema has a long and embarrassing history of racism. Depictions of Asians, African-Americans, Arabs and other ethnic groups have been patronizing, cartoonish and insulting not just for years but for generations. To believe that black actors, writers and film artists are not worthy of nomination, and to largely ignore these artists over the years, is to be willfully ignorant of this sordid history. The Academy should be embarrassed and is rightly taking action to diversify its membership, just as the major studios should take efforts to diversify their movie offerings and the roles they offer to ethnic minorities.'b'JOSEPH McGOVERN'b'White Plains'b'To the Editor: Re \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Lupita Nyong\xe2\x80\x99o and Other Stars Join Oscar Protest'b',\xe2\x80\x9d by Cara Buckley (The Carpetbagger, 'b'nytimes.com'b', Jan. 21): Before 1980, in 51 years, only 13 black actors received Oscar nominations, two of whom won the coveted trophy. The next two decades produced 23 nominations and four winners; and since 2000 there have been 29 nominations and nine winners. To the impartial observer, the increase of black nominations is conspicuous, accelerating with impressive speed. As progress isn\xe2\x80\x99t lacking and its pace is rapid, one may wonder at the large degree of umbrage taken by certain (by no means all) black members of the motion picture industry. What do they want, an affirmative action program? Films and actors are to be judged based on the quality of the product and performance, not the color of their skin or the content of their character.'b'Boycotting only agitates an institution that, with exponential speed, is on its way to fixing the problem. But someone\xe2\x80\x99s being black, or white or any other color shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t ever be the basis for selection.'b'MICHAEL E.

No whites on TV shows or newscasts. No white co-workers, police officers, firefighters, teachers, doctors or folks at the grocery store. Now imagine how it must be when people of color do not see themselves represented in films or on TV.

And it should not be seen as threatening to anyone.

The color of the performers\xe2\x80\x99 or producers\xe2\x80\x99 skin should not enter into their selection, and it would detract from that standard were the Academy to consider diversity as a factor.'b'In the past black actors, directors, producers and craftsmen have been deservedly nominated for and won Oscars, not, as the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. proclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cjudged by the color of their skin,\xe2\x80\x9d but for their artistic achievements. No one protested those results.

It was awkward at first, but there was wine, and conversation soon followed. At one point, the wife asked about my tour in Iraq, where I served four years as a cavalry officer. I began talking about the desert, the tribal politics and the day-to-day travails of counterinsurgency. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all fine,\xe2\x80\x9d the husband interrupted. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tell us about the super-soldiers. The Special-Ops guys. That\xe2\x80\x99s what people care about.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He had no time for \xe2\x80\x9cG.I. Joe.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Sniper.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He is not alone. The mythos of Special Operations has seized our nation\xe2\x80\x99s popular imagination, and has proved to be the one prism through which the public will engage with America\xe2\x80\x99s wars. From the box office to bookstores, the Special Ops commando \xe2\x80\x94 quiet and professional, stoic and square-jawed \xe2\x80\x94 thrives. That he works in the shadows, where missions are classified and enemy combatants come in silhouettes of night-vision green, is all for the better \xe2\x80\x94 details only complicate. We like our heroes sanitized, perhaps especially in murky times like these.'b'The age of the commando, though, is more than pop cultural fantasy emanating from Hollywood. It\xe2\x80\x99s now a significant part of our military strategy.'b'Last month the White House announced the nomination of Gen. Joseph L. Votel to lead United States Central Command, which is responsible for military operations in 20 countries in the Middle East and Central Asia, including Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria and Saudi Arabia \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, the hotbed of our geopolitical conflicts. General Votel has been the head of the military\xe2\x80\x99s Special Operations Command since 2014. His Central Command nomination represents a break in tradition; it has almost always gone to generals of more conventional backgrounds. Military analysts hailed it as a sign of the Obama administration\xe2\x80\x99s trust in, and reliance on, Special Operations.'b'Special Operations Command, or Socom, oversees all Special Operations Forces \xe2\x80\x94 our Delta Force operators, Navy SEALs, Green Berets, Army Rangers, among others. Special Operations personnel deployed to approximately 139 nations in 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 about 70 percent of the countries on the planet. While a vast majority of those missions involve training the defense forces of partner countries, a few involve direct combat.'b'In December, Secretary of Defense Ashton B. Carter announced at a House hearing that an \xe2\x80\x9cexpeditionary targeting force\xe2\x80\x9d will be sent to Iraq to conduct raids on top Islamic State targets. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be joining the roughly 3,500 troops already there working as advisers and trainers. President Obama seems desperate to strike a balance between doing nothing in the region and not reneging on his \xe2\x80\x9cno boots on the ground\xe2\x80\x9d promises.'b'Clearly, commandos have boots, and those boots touch the ground. But White House officials have taken to what a report in this newspaper recently called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'linguistic contortions'b'\xe2\x80\x9d to obscure the forces\xe2\x80\x99 combat roles.'b'As the military as a whole downsizes, Special Ops recruitment continues to rise. There are approximately 70,000 Special Ops personnel today, a number that includes soldiers, civilians, National Guard and Reservists, as well. This number is up from 45,600 in 2001 and 61,400 in 2011. Still, Adm. William H. McRaven \xe2\x80\x94 then the head of Socom \xe2\x80\x94 told Congress in 2014 that \xe2\x80\x9cthe force has continued to fray\xe2\x80\x9d from the endless deployment cycles. In response, the Army alone last year put out a call for 5,000 new Special Ops candidates.'b'In the political sense, the policy works. The secrecy surrounding Special Ops keeps the heavy human costs of war off the front pages. But in doing so, it also keeps the nonmilitary public wholly disconnected from the armed violence carried out in our name. It enables our state of perpetual warfare, and ensures that as little as we care and understand today, we\xe2\x80\x99ll care and understand even less tomorrow.'b'Special Operations are not a panacea. Just as SWAT teams can\xe2\x80\x99t fulfill their purpose without everyday beat cops on corners, operators can\xe2\x80\x99t and don\xe2\x80\x99t function in a vacuum. Many a military analyst has compared our current \xe2\x80\x9ccounterterror\xe2\x80\x9d approach to a Band-Aid; while effective, that effectiveness has no clear end state. And recent history suggests an overreliance on our commandos can lead to tragedy. In 1993, in Somalia, Special Operations seemed a cure-all, too. Then came the battle of Mogadishu. Same with 1980 and Operation Eagle Claw, as we desperately tried to end the Iran hostage crisis. The former led to a short-lived retreat from international intervention, the latter to the very creation of Socom.'b'Further, like a postmodern Praetorian Guard, our operators don\xe2\x80\x99t serve at the will of the American people. Though Congress holds the purse strings for Special Operations, decisions about individual missions are not generally put before them for approval. Individual force commanders overwhelmingly make those calls. While Mr. Obama has proved cautious in authorizing their use, the next commander in chief might not be so prudent.'b'Clear away the smoke and romance, and Special Ops often function as highly trained kill squads sent out into the beyond in the name of country. They are the best there is at that. But this strategy ensures a recurring cycle of armed conflict, a decision of such significance that all citizens need to be weighing it and considering it, not just a select few.'b'My own experience with Special Ops is mixed. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have many positive encounters with them overseas. As part of the fabled surge in Iraq, my scout platoon and I patrolled a rural town north of Baghdad for 15 months on a counterinsurgency mission that often seemed to conflict with that of the operators.'b'IN early 2008 we were called to a farm to help pick up the pieces after a commando raid. A tribal leader claimed that two of his lieutenants had been taken by mistake by \xe2\x80\x9cthe other Americans, the ones with helicopters.\xe2\x80\x9d Those other Americans, the tribal leader told me, said that the two Iraqis were brothers, and members of Al Qaeda in Iraq. Now we were left to explain to the men\xe2\x80\x99s family why they were gone, why their house had been cycloned, and why a placard of Mecca had been torn from a wall, and receive the hard stares from those men\xe2\x80\x99s children as we stood over a dead pet dog that had been shot during the raid.'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t tell that story to our dinner companions, though. Instead I talked about a visit I made to Tacoma, Wash., in 2011, when I got to know the other side of these other Americans. I\xe2\x80\x99d left the military and was now a writer, or trying to be one. A college friend and his Ranger unit were returning from Afghanistan, and I had visions of writing a tale of young men constantly at war but in between battles.'b'The Rangers, the Special Ops unit that Pat Tillman left his N.F.L. career in 2002 to join, is a proving ground of sorts, and attracts many younger soldiers.

They\xe2\x80\x99re the fullbacks of the Special Ops world, all brute force and power, as memorialized in the film \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Hawk Down\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cWe get on the five-yard line,\xe2\x80\x9d a Ranger officer tells a dismissive Delta soldier, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99re going to need my Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The days in Tacoma were spent trying (and failing) to get the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 public affairs office to approve on-post access. The nights in Tacoma were mostly spent in bars with young Rangers looking to unwind from their last tour while also prepping for the next one. They described the routine: three to six months deployed, three to six months stateside, rinse and repeat. Elizabeth Samet, who teaches English at West Point, calls these service members \xe2\x80\x9cwar commuters.\xe2\x80\x9d More than one observer in Tacoma, including some partners and spouses, termed it an addiction.'b'If that was true \xe2\x80\x94 and it didn\xe2\x80\x99t apply to many, in my estimation \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99d have their reasons.'b'A number of Rangers I met joked that vampires saw more light than they did during their deployments. I came to see these young men in a way I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t when I\xe2\x80\x99d worn the uniform myself, because of the way they embraced the endlessness of it all. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t fighting for resolution, as we\xe2\x80\x99d been in Iraq, or how we thought we\xe2\x80\x99d been. Peace over there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t their goal. Calm back here was.'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that worldview, not at all. But I still appreciated it.'b'On Super Bowl Sunday, my friend and I were invited to watch the game with a group of older sergeants. It seemed that most had already settled into their stateside lives, sharing diaper responsibilities with their wives, swapping war stories with one another in between.'b'While the adults watched the game, kids ran around with Nerf guns as big as they were. This was no Cowboys and Indians. They were playing \xe2\x80\x9cRangers and Rangers.\xe2\x80\x9d They all wanted to be like Daddy, and none were willing to play the role of an Al Qaeda jihadist, even in pretend.'b'The baby-faced Ranger privates I helped sneak into bars in 2011 are hardened sergeants by now. The sergeants I met are either in charge of entire Ranger companies or have moved into the so-called black units of Socom, like Delta Force. They remain anonymous silhouettes to the country they serve, not just because their bosses at the Pentagon want it that way, but because we do, too.'b'The other Americans, indeed.'b'A weekly comic strip featured in the Sunday Review.'b'IN recent years, New York City has invested over $2 billion in spectacular new waterfront parks. But that investment, and New Yorkers\xe2\x80\x99 enjoyment of their parks and neighborhoods, is being ruined by an invasion of noisy, polluting tourist helicopters.'b'The long piers in Hudson River Park, near Chelsea, seem an inviting retreat, well removed from the noise of the West Side Highway. But these days the pleasure of a sunny bench and a river view is being obliterated by a fleet of helicopters flying up and down the Hudson. Just as the noise from one chopper fades away, a new one approaches, and it feels as if we\xe2\x80\x99re trapped in a landing zone on a military base.'b'This experience is not unique to one pier, or even to one city park. Daily, about two million people on both sides of the Hudson have their senses attacked by the plague of tourist helicopters.'b'According to New York City Economic Development Corporation estimates, there were over 56,000 sightseeing tourist helicopter trips in 2014, operating every day, for as much as 10 hours a day \xe2\x80\x94 and all taking off from the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. To be clear, we are not including helicopters used by the police and hospitals, or even private business and leisure charters. In 2014, nontourist flights accounted for merely 1,936 of the 58,021 flights taking off from the downtown heliport. Moreover, tours represented 75 percent of 'b'all'b' flights taking off from Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s three city-owned heliports.'b'City leaders should consider the high price we pay for helicopter tourism, a cost to our environment and to the quality of life in our parks and neighborhoods. While the revenue to the city is negligible, a 1999 report on one of the heliports cited research stating that helicopters were the \xe2\x80\x9csource of measurable quantities of smog-forming gases and elevated levels of formaldehyde and other cancer-causing toxic emissions.\xe2\x80\x9d Workers at 55 Water Street have filed more than 1,200 complaints of headaches, nausea and respiratory irritation caused by helicopter exhaust in their building\xe2\x80\x99s ventilation system.'b'The Airbus AS350 series of helicopters, one of the most popular among tour operators, produces approximately 950 pounds of carbon dioxide'b''b' emissions per hour; the average car produces 22 pounds per hour. There are often eight helicopters motoring on the downtown heliport at any time. For those living and working nearby, that\xe2\x80\x99s like 340 cars idling outside your window. Conservatively estimated, the 56,000 annual tourist flights have a carbon footprint greater than 6,000 metric tons.'b'The reason so many people are affected is the city-defined route the sightseeing helicopters take. The tourist choppers take off from the city-owned heliport in the Financial District, and typically swoop over toward Brooklyn Bridge Park, circle around Governors Island and the 'b'Statue of Liberty'b', and fly north up the West Side, buzzing over miles of new waterfront parks. They then motor to the New Jersey side of the river and make the trip back down, effectively passing these locations twice per trip. Each tourist pays between $144 and $290 for a 15- to 30-minute ride. And with helicopters carrying up to six passengers, that means a half-hour trip could earn operators more than $1,500.'b'The recent public and private investment in new waterfront parks is aimed at providing rest and relaxation at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge. At Brooklyn Bridge Park, there is even a green sound berm to block the noise from the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway as it skirts Brooklyn Heights. But you can\xe2\x80\x99t find quiet at the ends of the piers there, or on Governors Island or in Hudson River and Riverside Parks because of the unending din of tourist helicopters. And Lower Manhattan, the fastest growing residential area in the state in recent years, is becoming an unpleasant place to raise a family, say some residents whose children cannot sleep.'b'At a recent City Council hearing on the subject, speaker after speaker talked about the torture of endless pollution and noise. More startling, Economic Development Corporation officials, defending the city\xe2\x80\x99s permitting of the flights, testified that the lease to the operators of the downtown heliport brought in only $3 million a year in direct revenue. But the private companies that run the tourist fleet probably gross tens of millions a year, using a heliport the city spent $6 million to renovate. To put that $3 million in context, the food concessions in Central Park alone net more revenue. Is that tiny rounding error in the city\xe2\x80\x99s revenue worth the daily misery inflicted on millions of New Yorkers?'b'Legislation being considered by the City Council\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental Protection Committee could help, and can\xe2\x80\x99t come soon enough. (On Sunday, the city announced a deal that would 'b'cut the number of tourist helicopter flights in half'b' by next January.) Banning helicopters that exceed federal noise levels from taking off and landing at city-owned heliports, as the council members\xe2\x80\x99 proposal would do, would instantly improve the city\xe2\x80\x99s air quality, and make our parks and neighborhoods once again oases of (relative) quiet.'b'And if the impact on the environment and on quality of life aren\xe2\x80\x99t enough to spur action, consider the security risks.

In his three years in the Senate, he has helped to engineer a shutdown of the government and has alienated virtually the entire chamber, both of which he bills as accomplishments since he lacks real ones. Now, whether he\xe2\x80\x99s threatening to \xe2\x80\x9c'b'carpet bomb'b'\xe2\x80\x9d Syrian villages or pitching a phony \xe2\x80\x9c'b'flat tax'b'\xe2\x80\x9d that would batter middle-class consumers, Mr. Cruz will say anything to win.

Jeb Bush has failed to ignite much support, but at least he has criticized the bigotry of Mr. Trump and the warmongering of Mr. Cruz. Senator Marco Rubio, currently embracing the alarmist views of the front-runners, seems to have forgotten his more positive \xe2\x80\x9cNew American Century\xe2\x80\x9d campaign, based on helping the middle-class.

John Kasich of Ohio, though a distinct underdog, is the only plausible choice for Republicans tired of the extremism and inexperience on display in this race. And Mr. Kasich is no moderate.

Today everyone is asking about Zika: How did this crisis happen, and what do we need to do to make it go away? We immediately forget about the outbreak that came before it, and don\xe2\x80\x99t plan for the ones we know are on the horizon. Almost no one wants to talk about Ebola or MERS now, or what we have or haven\xe2\x80\x99t done to try to prevent an ugly recurrence.'b'When it comes to diseases, we have a very short attention span, and we tend to be reactive, rather than proactive. Instead of devoting ourselves to a comprehensive plan to combat microbial threats, we scramble to respond to the latest one in the headlines. There are lessons from previous infectious disease outbreaks that could and should have left us much better prepared than we are.'b'First, the mosquito that transmits this disease, the species Aedes aegypti, has never been more numerous or lived in more locations. Think of Aedes aegypti as the Norway rat of mosquitoes; it has evolved to live in close quarters with humans, and the trash that humans create. This is quite different from most other species of mosquitoes, like the ones that transmit West Nile virus, which tend to lay their eggs in marshes, rice fields, ditches, the edges of streams and small, temporary rain pools.'b'The world has changed dramatically in the past 40 years with regard to increasing the habitat for Aedes aegypti breeding. An explosion of plastic and rubber solid waste now litters virtually all parts of the globe, particularly in the developing world. Non-biodegradable containers, used tires and discarded plastic bags and wrappers \xe2\x80\x94 whether in the backyard, a roadside ditch or an abandoned lot \xe2\x80\x94 make ideal habitats for these mosquitoes to lay their eggs. All they need is a little rainfall.'b'This species is currently present in 12 states in the United States, mostly in the Southeast. But its close cousin, Aedes albopictus, known as the Asian tiger mosquito, came to the United States in the 1980s and is now in some 30 states, including the entire Eastern Seaboard up to New York City. For now, fortunately, this species does not appear to be a significant factor in the transmission of Zika to humans. What we in North America have to worry about is whether the Asian tiger mosquito can become a more effective transmitter of the virus to humans. If that happened, we would face a very serious risk of an outbreak here.'b'One of the solutions to this problem is called \xe2\x80\x9cvector control.\xe2\x80\x9d It involves both eliminating the places where these mosquitoes breed, or chemically treating those sites, and spraying chemical insecticides to kill adult mosquitoes, or at least keep them away from where humans live, work and play. We must clean up the garbage to have any hope of reducing Zika infections in humans.'b'From the 1950s through the 1970s, there was a major initiative to eradicate Aedes aegypti from the Americas by public health organizations, nonprofits and national governments. It almost succeeded. In part, that was because eliminating these mosquitoes\xe2\x80\x99 breeding sites was much simpler before the spread of plastic and rubber waste. But governments and nonprofit agencies decided too early that the job had been done, and dismantled these programs to save money. Now the mosquito is back.'b'This is not new science or new policy. Now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got an outbreak on our hands, and although the symptoms of Zika itself are absent to mild for most, for some there can be devastating consequences to infection. An increasing number of infected women have given birth to babies with microcephaly, which causes small heads and brain damage. We\xe2\x80\x99re learning that Zika can lead to Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 syndrome, a dangerous autoimmune disorder that can cause paralysis. Some believe we need more scientific data to confirm these more severe manifestations. I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree; I believe the evidence is already compelling.'b'We shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have needed thousands of babies born with severe birth defects or people of all ages developing life-threatening autoimmune paralysis to remind us that mosquitoes pose a serious health threat. Dengue viruses, which are also transmitted by these two mosquito species, caused 2.3 million cases of dengue fever and far more serious dengue hemorrhagic fever in 2013 in the same countries in the Americas that have been, or will be, affected by Zika. These included more than 37,000 severe illnesses and 1,300 deaths. And yet these numbers hardly raised an eyebrow in the United States. If we had paid more attention then, we might be more prepared now.'b'Zika is here to stay in the Western Hemisphere; it will be part of life for many years to come. Even if we make vector control efforts a major initiative, it will only reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of Zika. What we need next, urgently, is a vaccine.'b'Some critics are suggesting that such vaccine research for Zika should have been done years ago, but this isn\xe2\x80\x99t entirely fair. It was only in the past two years that there was any indication this virus could cause serious human disease. Now we have to catch up. But it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be complicated. If Guillain-Barr\xc3\xa9 syndrome is indeed caused by the patient\xe2\x80\x99s immune response to the virus, as happens with other infectious diseases, could the vaccine itself put us at risk? This will take careful research to determine. And it will take time.'b'The point is, we should have anticipated that the large increase in mosquitoes would create a major health crisis. Just as we should have anticipated that a deadly hemorrhagic disease caused by the Ebola virus would emerge one day from the remote forests and threaten the vast slums of the rapidly growing megacities of Africa. We should now anticipate that the MERS virus will result in more deadly outbreaks outside of the Arabian Peninsula, as it did in Seoul, South Korea. We should anticipate that viruses such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis may spread from their jungle homes and be even more deadly than Zika.'b'Even more than these viruses, we should be afraid of a planet-wide catastrophe caused by influenza. The best way to avert a pandemic is to develop a game-changing universal influenza vaccine. All these crises are largely predictable and we can do much in advance to lessen the effects and diminish the spread. And believe me, the cost of acting now will be infinitely less than the cost of not acting in the long run.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 I LEFT London and moved to India in August 2008. Four weeks later, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, and the global economy went into a tailspin. People who had known the word \xe2\x80\x9cderivative\xe2\x80\x9d only as an adjective in book reviews were now using it as a noun; \xe2\x80\x9csubprime\xe2\x80\x9d entered the vocabulary of the uninitiated. The City of London seemed to be at the heart of this disaster whose effects were surging out over the cobbled streets of the Square Mile and into the farthest corners of the world, including my new home in the small southern Indian city Mysore.'b'Since then I have returned to London once or twice a year, emerging from the sliding doors at Heathrow with a feeling of evermore imprecise familiarity. What exactly happens when you leave a city and then return year after year, still not prepared to call yourself an ex but increasingly bewildered, like a tourist?'b'Some of the changes I can see only as benign. As I walk around the city, I look up rather than straight ahead. Sights I\xe2\x80\x99d never glimpsed before crowd into view: the strange crenelations at the top of a wall behind Guy\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, the branches of a bowed lime tree in St. Paul\xe2\x80\x99s churchyard, an elegant hand holding a cigarette out of a top-floor window in Arlington Square. It seems absurd to admit that in the whirl of daily life I missed so many small particularities of the place I called home for over 13 years. And yet I did.'b'When I now visit London, I adopt new lines of inquiry. While I lived in the city, it never occurred to me that I might be interested in the history of some of its striking street names: Birdcage Walk, Bleeding Heart Yard, Hanging Sword Alley, Cold Blow Lane. Now, after years of absence, I can\xe2\x80\x99t stop imagining the scenes behind the names: the Royal Aviary, say, or the beating heart ripped out of a body in a sunless passage.'b'In some respects I have not changed: Making eye contact with other passengers on the Tube still is repugnant. But I no longer hiss and tut at people who stand to the left on escalators. When a group of tourists on Regent Street suddenly stop to rummage in their rucksacks and force me to slacken my pace, I do not fill up with a murderous rage. A lady in the line at the bank strikes up a conversation, and I do not recoil. Rather than doing everything possible to avoid Leicester Square, I now amble across it, even pausing in front of one of the souvenir shops. Briefly.'b'Yet some aspects of my transformation are more than a little disquieting. One evening I find myself in Soho at a junction that I must have crossed a thousand times over the years. Suddenly my journey turns into a series of stop-motion frames. I step off the pavement. I step back on to it. I look in every direction, at the street names, at the awning over a restaurant, at a sign above a theater\xe2\x80\x99s stage door. There is a remembered flash of neon and a suggestion of a well-worn shortcut down an alley. But then my mind goes blank, and I realize I no longer know which road to take.'b'In his essay \xe2\x80\x9cLondon,\xe2\x80\x9d Henry James writes, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a kind of humiliation in a great city not to know where you are going.\xe2\x80\x9d But how much more humiliating when it\xe2\x80\x99s a city that you once roamed, sometimes in a frenzied rush, sometimes in a slow haze, but almost always with a sense of possession.'b'The wallet dropped on a street corner, the elderly man bursting into his rendition of \xe2\x80\x9cForever and Ever\xe2\x80\x9d on that snowy stairway, the date that ended badly in front of the convenience store. The memories remain, but the landmarks are lost. Where does this imprinted knowledge go? And what do you do with the slow sense of panic that results? Suspended somewhere in a fade to black is the realization that you are incrementally losing the city where you spent most of your adult life.'b'Most jarring, I\xe2\x80\x99ve lost my old relationship with the map of the Tube. Its lineations, loops and hard angles had always seemed to provide as recognizable a connection as the grooves on my palms. The progression of stations, the interchanges, the locus of destinations \xe2\x80\x94 none of these required thought: I had internalized them. But on my last visit, as commuters surged around me at Westminster station, I could no longer quite remember what \xe2\x80\x9ceastbound\xe2\x80\x9d meant, and as I stood in front of the giant map in the ticket hall for a few seconds, the lights seemed to dim.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cThe Lonely Londoners,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam Selvon\xe2\x80\x99s seminal novel about post-World War II immigration to the city, London is harsh and elusive, a place that simultaneously delivers a feeling of propinquity and a feeling of dislocation to men recently arrived from the West Indies. Some of the novel\xe2\x80\x99s descriptions could just as well apply to London as experienced by a former resident: \xe2\x80\x9cwith a fog sleeping restlessly over the city and the lights showing in a blur as if it is not London at all but some strange place on another planet.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Selvon\xe2\x80\x99s Londoners mark urban boundaries through their sense of security, community and language \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cthe Gate\xe2\x80\x9d for Notting Hill, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Arch\xe2\x80\x9d for Marble Arch, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Water\xe2\x80\x9d for Bayswater. We all create our own personal geography to help explain who we are, where we\xe2\x80\x99ve come from and why. What happens when those coordinates come unmoored?'b'The refectory-style restaurant near the Barbican, where once the helpings were enormous and the air was filled with the scent of stewed cabbage, is now a smart dining club with a giant stone urn on each side of the door. As I pressed my nose against its plate-glass window, small personal changes seemed all too evident \xe2\x80\x94 the haunts that have disappeared, the friends who have moved away. But in the amber corona of the new pendant lights I perceived larger changes, too: neighborhoods that have been cored out, the proliferation of food banks and the homeless, the elderly and the disabled marooned at home.'b'On my last day in London I received an old gas bill that had been redirected twice and was paid several years ago. The postal code was legible, but most of the rest was a dark blue smudge.'b'There will be new maps and compasses for those of us who leave, new points of departure that will eventually become wholly real. But at the end of my most recent visit, as I flew out of Heathrow, over the tower blocks and the discs of green parkland and the sweep of the motorway, I caught a glimpse of a bend in the Thames, so familiar and so alien, and I wondered if it had all been a trick of the light.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTHERE is nothing more sexist than wanting Hillary Clinton as president because she\xe2\x80\x99s a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That is the attack I faced, in December, from women on a cruise organized by The Nation, the stalwart liberal magazine. The ship was steady enough, but I was rocked by the vitriol. A Nation editor estimated that 70 percent of cruise participants were Bernie Sanders supporters, and about 30 percent of those thought of Hillary Clinton as evil incarnate.'b'I was there to speak about Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s political career, but suddenly found myself fighting paranoia that I was being shunned as a traitor to the progressive cause. I observed that most of the 200 or so women onboard were feminist boomers, ages 52 to 70-plus. Many had shared Hillary Rodham\xe2\x80\x99s long history as a woman fighting for gender equality, capped with her declaration in 'b'Beijing in 1995'b' that \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s rights are human rights.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mrs. Clinton, 68, has always counted on women of her generation as her rock-solid base. Polls don\xe2\x80\x99t quantify doubts, but anecdotally, enthusiasm for her is anemic. Ambivalence is seeping in about her authenticity and the power of her symbolism as a woman. Once again, she has been caught coasting on inevitability by a grass-roots idealist with a universal health care plan. And there\xe2\x80\x99s a sense that those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling, from 2008, were historic enough.'b'Kathryn Levy, a poet and arts educator of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s vintage, said: \xe2\x80\x9cBetween Hillary coming so close to winning the nomination in \xe2\x80\x9908, and an African-American man winning the election, that narrow mold of who could be president has already been broken.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Over the past several months, I have had some 50 conversations with Democratic women of boomer age. A female editor at a prestigious national magazine confided: \xe2\x80\x9cI should be jumping up and down with enthusiasm for Hillary\xe2\x80\x99s candidacy, but I\xe2\x80\x99m not.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked if she would vote for Hillary in the end. \xe2\x80\x9cI am waiting to see if Bernie wins Iowa,\xe2\x80\x9d she whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cIf so, I\xe2\x80\x99m right there!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re worried that Hillary is not true to herself,\xe2\x80\x9d admitted the founder of an influential political forum in New York, also begging anonymity. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of women vote from a compassionate, nurturing place, and those are not qualities you feel from her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the 2008 presidential election, many boomer women, especially self-described \xe2\x80\x9cborn feminists\xe2\x80\x9d like Lorraine Dusky, a writer and activist based on Long Island, started out as monotheistic Hillary worshipers. When a young, passionate African-American senator stole her thunder, \xe2\x80\x9cmost of the Democratic women I knew turned to Obama,\xe2\x80\x9d recalls Ms. Dusky. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you dared to say you were for Hillary, they\xe2\x80\x99d lash out, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re crazy!\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d The venom took a toll. This time, Ms. Dusky, having passed 70, said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m feeling Clinton fatigue. Even exhaustion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Rev. Katrina Foster, a Lutheran pastor for 21 years, told me, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no longer interested in the physical packaging of these candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d Pastor Foster, who is gay, acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton finally had the right position on gay issues. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we now have won rights, I\xe2\x80\x99m more concerned with what we have lost \xe2\x80\x94 what it means to be an American.\xe2\x80\x9d She is leaning toward supporting Bernie Sanders.'b'By mid-January, polls were showing this erosion among voters for Mrs. Clinton. Her once-dominant lead over Mr. Sanders had almost vanished in Iowa. The momentum of his socialist political revolution, fueled by donations that average of under $30, kept mounting.'b'Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s pollster, Joel Benenson, was adamant that nothing had changed among Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s base. \xe2\x80\x9cHer women peers are still her strongest supporters and why she\xe2\x80\x99s leading in every single state polled, by significant margins.\xe2\x80\x9d The campaign knows it needs these peers, of course: Women vote in greater numbers than men, and older people have higher voting rates than younger voters.'b'But based on the campaign\xe2\x80\x99s own polling and canvassing, the caucus votes of many women in Iowa are still up for grabs.'b'I called one of the independent voters whom the Clinton camp covets. A clinical psychologist in Northern California, Dr. Jennifer Gans, actually moaned: \xe2\x80\x9cI am so conflicted. I think she\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly smart, and nobody has more experience. As a female, I feel proud and validated by her candidacy. It\xe2\x80\x99s really uncomfortable to want so much to like her, and to cringe when I\xe2\x80\x99m forced to think about the things I don\xe2\x80\x99t like.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among those unlikables consistently repeated to me by women who are conflicted about her: not authentic; can\xe2\x80\x99t trust her; she lies; she\xe2\x80\x99s establishment; she\xe2\x80\x99s a hawk. But then they\xe2\x80\x99ll turn around and sigh, \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be great to have a woman president, though.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been a long time since that devastating moment in June 2008 when Mrs. Clinton finally internalized the shock of defeat in her first presidential contest. She had run like a man, proving her commander in chief credentials. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I am a woman, and like millions of women I know there are still barriers and biases out there, often unconscious,\xe2\x80\x9d she declared proudly. \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we weren\xe2\x80\x99t able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time, thanks to you it\xe2\x80\x99s got about 18 million cracks in it.\xe2\x80\x9d Women in tears broke into deafening applause.'b'Now Hillary Clinton, the 2016 candidate, has to find the passion \xe2\x80\x94 not just the policies \xe2\x80\x94 to counter the exhilaration of revolutionary change that fires up Mr. Sanders\xe2\x80\x99s supporters and to discredit the populist paranoia that stirs hatred among Donald J. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s left-behind, working-class whites.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is the enthusiasm for Hillary? It\xe2\x80\x99s a fair question,\xe2\x80\x9d admits Lynn Forester de Rothschild, 61, a loyal donor and fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton. When Mr. Obama won the nomination in 2008, Ms. de Rothschild resigned in fury from the Democratic platform committee and marched out of the convention leading a group called PUMA \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cparty unity my ass\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 to vote for John McCain.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShame on us \xe2\x80\x94 Democrats and particularly friends of Hillary \xe2\x80\x94 because we allowed Republicans and the media to paint a caricature of Hillary for far too long,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. de Rothschild told me.'b'Mrs. Clinton is painting her own portrait this time \xe2\x80\x94 leaning in to her gender, especially as an argument against the charge that she is a Washington insider.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho can be more of an outsider than a woman president?\xe2\x80\x9d she has said.'b'This gender-focused approach seemed to be working well for Mrs. Clinton last July, when 71 percent of Democratic-leaning women voters said they expected to vote for her, according to a 'b'Washington Post-ABC News poll'b'. By September, Democrats were wringing their hands over her email scandal, and her support from the same women had dropped almost 30 percentage points.'b'That much-hyped controversy reminded many of us of Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most consistent character flaw: the instinct to stonewall whenever she is confronted with a negative, but legitimate, criticism of her actions.'b'When Ms. de Rothschild talked to Mrs. Clinton last fall about her eroding support, she found the candidate unfazed: \xe2\x80\x9cShe told me, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, in October I have an opportunity to do debates, and after that the Benghazi hearings, the first time Americans can truly see me.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s prediction came true. Her composure through 'b'11 hours'b' of Republican jackhammering was a tutorial in how to handle powerful men who oppose a woman of power and feel free to denigrate and intimidate her.'b'After the Benghazi inquisition, a national coalition of several hundred executive women who advocate for Mrs. Clinton saw a sudden leap of 10 percent in membership, according to the group\xe2\x80\x99s co-founder, the former politician Sherrye Henry.'b'Many fiercely loyal Hillary-ists appreciate her lifelong commitment to empowering women and girls. As secretary of state, she worked that issue into the portfolio of future secretaries. A gynecologist who is exactly Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s age represents legions of women adamant about saving reproductive freedom: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not voting for any politician who has inordinate interest in what goes on in my vagina.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WHEN I began writing about the Clintons in the earliest days of their first national campaign in 1992 as a \xe2\x80\x9ctwo for the price of one\xe2\x80\x9d president, I asked the cocky young governor of Arkansas about their long-term goal. Bill Clinton sang out the private slogan of their eternal campaign:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEight years of Bill, eight years of Hill.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I used to hear from professional boomer women endless predictions of when Hillary Clinton would leave her cheating husband \xe2\x80\x94 after they exited the White House, once she won her Senate election, certainly once she bought her own home in Washington. I always said she would never leave him; they are symbiotic, and besides, they love each other.'b'For many women who have lived through similar betrayals in life, another narrative has taken hold in recent years: Hillary Clinton is the model of an indomitable woman. She deflects shaming and swallows humiliation and keeps her eye on her purpose in life. She is a deeply committed mother and partner to one of the most gifted political leaders of our time. It took a Hillary to raise a president, to keep their family together, and to allow them to continue contributing to this country and the world.'b'In early 1992, I watched her develop a political strategy that for years deflected her own anger at Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s women. I was standing next to Mrs. Clinton in a motel lobby when the TV flashed an image of Gennifer Flowers, a lounge singer with slot-machine eyes. She was playing phone tapes of steamy sex talk with Governor Clinton for the press. I stared at Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s profile. No surprise. Quick blink. She dispatched a press secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cget our surrogates on the line.\xe2\x80\x9d Sitting knee to knee with her on the tiny plane out of South Dakota, I heard her swear that if she had Ms. Flowers on the stand, \xe2\x80\x9cI would 'b'crucify'b' her.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s when she laid down the strategy the Clintons used until recently: \xe2\x80\x9cPound the Republican attack machine and run against the press.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now, the Clintons\xe2\x80\x99 union is again campaign fodder. Mr. Trump is branding Mrs. Clinton as the \xe2\x80\x9cenabler\xe2\x80\x9d who defended Bill Clinton from a decade of attacks as what Mr. Trump calls \xe2\x80\x9c'b'one of the great abusers of the world'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This strategy, on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s part, digs up memories of the tawdry tabloid years and the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cbimbo eruptions\xe2\x80\x9d that Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaries, especially women, would rather not recall. Millennial women will most likely be learning for the first time not just how Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s presidency brought the country a budget surplus, but why he was impeached and what his wife did to save him.'b'Her strategy for coping then was an instructive one.'b'In 1999, when I published a biography of this globally admired woman, \xe2\x80\x9cHillary\xe2\x80\x99s Choice,\xe2\x80\x9d I viewed the Clinton presidency through the lens of the Clinton marriage. The saga of Bill and Hillary, with its echoes of Eleanor and Franklin and undertones of Bonnie and Clyde, was animated by melodrama, narrow escapes, knock-down-drag-outs. They seemed to thrive on it.'b'Today, Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s defenders insist that she is willing to learn, grow and change. Trudy Mason, vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, points to Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s total loyalty to Mr. Obama after losing her fierce campaign against him. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I had to define Hillary in a word, she\xe2\x80\x99s a mensch,\xe2\x80\x9d says Ms. Mason, \xe2\x80\x9ca real down-to-earth, nitty-gritty person.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But even Ms. Mason admits that she hears a sense of ambivalence among some of Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s most enduring supporters: senior African-American women. When Ruth Hassell-Thompson campaigned for the New York State Senate, together with Mrs. Clinton in 2000, the newly liberated first lady got to know Mrs. Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s family. Now, Mrs. Thompson\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year-old grandson is shocked when he asks Granny whom she\xe2\x80\x99s going to vote for.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the first time she hasn\xe2\x80\x99t knocked herself out for Hillary Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cIt makes me very angry that I and other women of color sacrificed a lot to stay with Hillary in 2008 when she ran against the first black president. I feel disregarded \xe2\x80\x94 never had a call, no outreach at all. It will be her loss.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mrs. Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s latest gain appears to be among moderate Republican women who are revolted by the extremism of Mr. Trump. The prominent director of a major museum in New York described herself to me as a \xe2\x80\x9cloyal to the core Republican\xe2\x80\x9d who has run arts programs for three presidents \xe2\x80\x94 the two Bushes and Mr. Obama. In December, she fired off an email to a dozen prominent Republican women friends declaring her defection from \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is left of the Republican Party. I just signed up for the Hillary campaign and made my first donation.\xe2\x80\x9d The other women approved.'b'Days before Iowans go to the polls, I called Ms. de Rothschild, who is volunteering for the campaign in South Carolina, for a look ahead. She laughed off any concern. \xe2\x80\x9cBoomer women in South Carolina, especially African Americans, are unequivocally committed to Hillary, no matter what happens in Iowa and New Hampshire,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Recently, I asked a senior campaign official if Mrs. Clinton was hatching any new strategy to stop Mr. Sanders. He said, \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s going to keep on grinding it out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After all these years of watching Hillary Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s star as it rises, falls, but always rises again, I would love to be a true believer.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m feeling ambivalent.'b'IN my early years as a police reporter, I often pulled up to a crime scene minutes before the homicide detectives arrived. Too many times to count I\xe2\x80\x99d find a young black man my age or younger dead with a halo of blood or brain matter splashed on the pavement. Often there were shell casings sprinkled around freshly fallen bodies.'b'Some were killed over turf, some out of revenge. Many were victims of the deadly grind of the drug trade. Others were killed by the police. A high number were innocent people caught in crossfire, many of them children.'b'I learned to identify family members by the level of grief they\xe2\x80\x99d show. Inconsolable wailing, unsteady feet, breathless delirium \xe2\x80\x94 a mother or sister. Angry, with balled fists and tears \xe2\x80\x94 a brother or close cousin. Girlfriends often ran in after the police had arrived, and the crime scene was set, clawing at the police tape. The best friends and homeboys stayed close but not too close, trading whispers before leaving the scene on clouds of three or four people at a time, vengeance bubbling up in their minds. The fathers always seemed stoic, either numbed by the pain or resigned to the way young black male life was so easily lost. They, too, had been young black men once.'b'In many of their faces I\xe2\x80\x99d seen the faces of my own family, people I loved and who loved me. I saw my own mother\xe2\x80\x99s tears and could imagine my older brother and his boys with guns tucked into their waistbands, ready to squeeze off shots had I been the one with a bloody halo.'b'Over more than a dozen years I\xe2\x80\x99ve evolved from a run-and-gun street reporter in Philadelphia and New Orleans to a national reporter flying across the country to cover social justice issues, high-profile incidents of shootings by police officers and the growing Black Lives Matter movement. But no matter the cause of the bloodshed I continue to chronicle, the tool of the garden-variety thug and beat cop alike remains essentially the same. The gun.'b'The toll of gun violence in our most beleaguered, depleted communities is great. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve recently arrived at yet another moment when the issue of guns has been thrust into the national political dialogue. President Obama just weeks ago rolled out 'b'executive actions'b' aimed at, among other things, closing the so-called 'b'gun show loophole'b' and the flow of illegal weapons to people who shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have them. What followed was much what you\xe2\x80\x99d expect from the partisan debate over guns. Conservatives rebuffed calls to make it the slightest bit more difficult to buy firearms. Many liberals said the president\xe2\x80\x99s actions didn\xe2\x80\x99t go far enough.'b'As politicians tangle over how best to manage the country\xe2\x80\x99s obscenely huge and growing arsenal of privately owned guns, the rat-a-tat of gun violence continues to bleed us all.'b'For those of us keeping tabs on the impact of guns in black and brown communities, there is no solace. This exhausting dance between black death and black scribe is as much a performance in journalism as it is a perpetual act of catharsis.'b'My family has experienced its own measure of gun death. In the mid-1970s, a couple of years before I was born, a disgruntled prospective tenant murdered my grandfather over a $160 security deposit. Decades later a young woman put a bullet in the back of my stepbrother\xe2\x80\x99s head. Years later, two cousins, brothers, would be touched by the plague: One was shot down and the other is serving a long prison sentence for a separate incident, a botched robbery turned murder.'b'An act of gun violence is central to the story of how I came to be, too. In 1924 my maternal grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s family joined the Great Migration north from Georgia after a white gunman killed her older brother. He was just 12 years old. The family eventually landed in New Jersey, but violence followed. In 1951 another of my grandmother\xe2\x80\x99s brothers, this one younger, was shot and killed by a New Jersey State Trooper. He was just 17. Years later, when my grandfather was killed he left behind eight children, including my mother.'b'Many times when I sat with victims\xe2\x80\x99 families and slowly drew out their stories and their tears, I have to believe, they saw me as one of their own. They often shooed away white reporters, but shared with me intimate memories of their loved ones. They dug up old yearbook photos and rattled off their dead boy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 they were almost always boys \xe2\x80\x94 hopes and dreams. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t shy away from their shortcomings, criminal or otherwise.'b'Years ago, in Philadelphia, I met a 19-year-old named 'b'Kevin Johnson'b' who weeks earlier had been paralyzed by a bullet to his spine. A group of teenagers had pressed a gun to the back of his neck and demanded the basketball jersey off his back. He refused and one of them pulled the trigger. The day I met him he\xe2\x80\x99d just started talking again and his family had smuggled me into his hospital room. Medical tubes and wires snaked from his body, tangling his lanky, limp brown frame.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give me anything I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t handle,\xe2\x80\x9d Kevin told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to try and live a regular life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His mother and I traded a look over his hospital bed, knowing his life would be anything but regular. A few years later, under the weight of catastrophic injury and medical complications, Kevin\xe2\x80\x99s body finally gave in.'b'I like to tell myself that I\xe2\x80\x99ve served as a conduit for the last whispers of lives lost too soon. That I am capturing, in a crucial way, the sad mundanity of American gun violence. But sometimes, it seems I\xe2\x80\x99m little more than a peddler of pain. A cog in a much broader story that seems to give short shrift to black death and too little scrutiny to a gun industry that profits while so many perish.'b'My days glued to a police scanner are long behind me. The fever of chasing gunfire and sirens has broken. I\xe2\x80\x99ve mostly traded covering individual tragedies for covering a movement that wants those individual tragedies to actually lead to some form of positive change. It feels as much like a natural progression as it does a sort of masochistic calling.'b'There are more than 'b'300 million guns in America'b'. Almost as many guns as there are Americans. And each year about 11,000 people are killed by guns wielded by others. An additional 20,000 or so use guns to take their own lives. While gun violence has fallen since the bad old days of the late 1980s and early \xe2\x80\x9990s, far too many people \xe2\x80\x94 in poor black communities in particular \xe2\x80\x94 remain trapped and traumatized by violence.'b'Last month, I was in Chicago, where through the first two weeks of the year, according to the Chicago police, homicides are up 113 percent and shootings are up nearly 200 percent from the same period last year.'b'I met a woman whose 20-year-old daughter was killed a couple of years ago, trapped in the crossfire of a gang shootout. She held her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s funeral on what would have been the girl\xe2\x80\x99s 21st'b''b' birthday. There have been no arrests in her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s case. Investigators haven\xe2\x80\x99t given her any updates and they\xe2\x80\x99ve all but stopped answering her incessant phone calls, she said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe just lost her life for nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman told me, cradling a heavy gold urn filled with her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s ashes. \xe2\x80\x9cI take her with me everywhere I go, because before she was killed we spent every minute together. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to keep carrying her with me until her death makes sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As that mother waits for closure, the bodies of the 90 or so people who are killed each day by guns in this country will continue to pile up. Whether we\xe2\x80\x99re carrying them in an urn or not, the burden of their weight belongs to all of us.'
