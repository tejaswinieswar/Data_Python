b'A grand jury indicted Ronald Gasser Jr. on Thursday in the fatal 'b' shooting of the former N.F.L. player Joe McKnight'b', handing down a second-degree murder charge. The charge is more severe than the one that Mr. Gasser had initially faced in December, when critics complained that racial bias may have affected the investigation.'b'If convicted, Mr. Gasser, 54, would face life in prison with no parole.'b'The death of Mr. McKnight, 28, a star running back at the University of Southern California who later played for 'b'the Jets'b' and Kansas City Chiefs in the N.F.L., spurred several days of protests. Supporters and Mr. McKnight\xe2\x80\x99s former teammates were outraged after the police 'b'initially freed Mr. Gasser'b'. Though the authorities said Mr. Gasser had admitted to the shooting on Dec. 1, he was not arrested and charged until four days later.'b'Mr. Gasser was initially charged with manslaughter over what the authorities described as a \xe2\x80\x9croad rage\xe2\x80\x9d confrontation in Terrytown, La., about five miles southeast of New Orleans.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSubsequent to that arrest, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Office and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office continued working together in a collaborative effort to develop additional evidence regarding the case,\xe2\x80\x9d the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office said in a statement Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x99s indictment comes as a result of that joint effort.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Gasser\xe2\x80\x99s bond was also increased to $750,000.'b'The delayed arrest and lesser initial charge had angered critics, who said that Mr. Gasser, the owner of a telecommunications firm and a real estate business, may have been afforded more leeway because he is white, or that the authorities were less invested in swift justice for a black man\xe2\x80\x99s death.'b'In a fiery response after the initial arrest, Sheriff Newell Normand of Jefferson Parish defended the pace of the investigation, saying the authorities needed time to build a better case in a state that has strong Stand Your Ground self-defense laws. Investigators conducted more than 160 interviews and spoke to Mr. Gasser for more than 12 hours, Sheriff Normand said at a news conference in December.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJustice has no time period,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJustice is not a sprint. It is a marathon. These investigations are marathons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The confrontation began around 2:45 p.m. after both men were driving erratically, cutting each other off and zipping in front of each other, Sheriff Normand said. Mr. Gasser became irate and engaged in a \xe2\x80\x9cverbal altercation\xe2\x80\x9d with Mr. McKnight, the sheriff said.'b'When they stopped next to each other at a red light, Mr. McKnight got out of his car and approached the window of Mr. Gasser\xe2\x80\x99s car, the sheriff said. Mr. Gasser then pulled out a handgun from between his seat and the console and shot Mr. McKnight three times, according to the sheriff.'b'STORRS, Conn. \xe2\x80\x94 When Connecticut won its 11th N.C.A.A. women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball title last spring\xe2\x80\x94 its fourth in a row \xe2\x80\x94 President Barack Obama joked that he would keep a room with a cot waiting for Coach 'b'Geno Auriemma'b' and the Huskies\xe2\x80\x99 regular visit to the White House.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe does seem to spend an awful lot of time here,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Obama said.'b'A trip to the White House, with the ceremonial awarding of a jersey to the president, has long been an affirmation for champion teams. But ire over the election of President Trump has spurred activism by athletes, coaches and officials perhaps not seen since the civil rights movement and the war in Vietnam.'b'Breanna Stewart, the former 'b'UConn'b' star who helped lead her team to the last four national titles, joined a protest at Los Angeles International Airport against Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s temporary ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations, a policy since rebuffed in federal court. Six members of the New England Patriots, who recently won their fifth Super Bowl, have said they will skip the team\xe2\x80\x99s White House trip, which has not yet been scheduled.'b'And now Mr. Auriemma is being asked a question he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t faced since his teams began winning titles in 1995, during the first term of the Clinton administration: Would any or all of the Huskies decline to meet the president should they win a 12th championship in April?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that in all the 11 championships I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been asked this question says something about where we are\xe2\x80\x9d as a country, Mr. Auriemma said. \xe2\x80\x9cForget the answer. The fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been asked means there\xe2\x80\x99s something going on that isn\xe2\x80\x99t normal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'UConn has won 100 consecutive games since 2014. And while the Huskies are not a lock to win a 12th title, they are favored again to cut down the nets in triumph at the Final Four in Dallas. Now coaches, current players and the team\xe2\x80\x99s former stars are wrestling with the issue of whether UConn should visit the White House in celebration.'b'The Huskies\xe2\x80\x99 players are amateurs, some still teenagers, not professionals with agents, union protection and multimillion-dollar contracts. They have kept up with the current political situation, and the responses by other athletes, through social media and classroom discussions. Their own reactions were nuanced and considered.'b'Even before Mr. Trump was elected, UConn players jokingly told one another, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not going if he wins,\xe2\x80\x9d the sophomore forward Napheesa Collier said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow that it\xe2\x80\x99s actually happened, if we win, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what everyone\xe2\x80\x99s going to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Stewart and Maya Moore, another former UConn star, said they expected that whatever decision the team made, it would be done collectively. Gabby Williams, a junior forward, agreed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s just what we\xe2\x80\x99ve built here,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Williams, the team\xe2\x80\x99s most complete player, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have guys that do their own thing. Whatever we do, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a unified decision.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If some players did not want to attend a White House celebration, Ms. Collier said, \xe2\x80\x9cI really don\xe2\x80\x99t know what I would do in that position; I guess we have to get there first.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Auriemma, who will turn 63 during the N.C.A.A. tournament, said the dilemma for him was reconciling respect for the office of the presidency with the possibility that some players might object to meeting Mr. Trump, feeling unwelcome at the White House because of the president\xe2\x80\x99s statements and positions on women, minorities, immigrants and Muslims.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we\xe2\x80\x99re fortunate enough to win it, and your players walk in and go, \xe2\x80\x98Listen, I\xe2\x80\x99m not going,\xe2\x80\x99 we\xe2\x80\x99ve never had to deal with that before,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Auriemma said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you going to do as a coach?\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like I can look it up and go, \xe2\x80\x98What did other people do?\xe2\x80\x99 We\xe2\x80\x99re in a world that very few of us could have conceived five years ago.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What would he do?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a good question.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is no pressing need for an answer now, he understands, no need to cross a point of no return. The national championship game is not until April 2, and there is no guarantee that UConn will be playing or winning.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not crossing the Rubicon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Auriemma said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Caesar. Once your army crosses that river, you are an enemy of the state.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Auriemma is no supporter of Mr. Trump. He made that clear last summer in Rio de Janeiro while coaching the American women\xe2\x80\x99s team to a second consecutive Olympic gold medal under him and sixth in a row over all. Asked whether dominance by the United States was good for women\xe2\x80\x99s basketball, he told reporters, \xe2\x80\x9cWe live in that Trumpian era where it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K. to be sexist and degrade people that are good, just because they\xe2\x80\x99re the opposite sex.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He later expressed shock that Mr. Trump had been elected president.'b'But Mr. Auriemma is also the most visible representative of Connecticut\xe2\x80\x99s flagship public university. And he has lived a classic immigrant success story, having been born in Italy and then moving to suburban Philadelphia as a boy, winning a record number of N.C.A.A. basketball titles and becoming wealthy in the process. He speaks reverently of the presidency as a symbol of \xe2\x80\x9cthe most that this country can represent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He tells of his mother, Marsiella, being overcome with tears when she shook hands and took a photograph with President Obama. And how boosters accompanying the team have variously complained about the policies of President Bill Clinton, President George W. Bush and President Obama on trips to Washington, yet \xe2\x80\x9conce they get down there, he puts his hand out and he says, \xe2\x80\x98Welcome to the White House,\xe2\x80\x99 and they just melt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s the president of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'One should not easily dismiss an opportunity to meet any president, Mr. Auriemma said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to do that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have some pretty strong convictions. And we\xe2\x80\x99ve got some pretty socially activist players on our team.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sue Bird, the former UConn point guard who won two N.C.A.A. titles and two of her four Olympic gold medals while playing for Mr. Auriemma, said that if some players felt unwelcome at the White House, he would surely take that into consideration.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think he\xe2\x80\x99s somebody that understands where he is in this world and what he represents and the platform he has,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Bird said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s shy about speaking out on his feelings. And with that, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised, to be honest, if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t go.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Bird stressed that she was speaking about her own observations, not about any impression that Mr. Auriemma had directly given her. Any decision, she said, would be a \xe2\x80\x9ctough call\xe2\x80\x9d and would be made by the coach with the intent of protecting his players.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause, in reality, they\xe2\x80\x99re kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Bird said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Huskies are a diverse team ethnically and culturally, and as with any team, there are varied political opinions, players said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the entire team wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kia Nurse, a junior guard from Hamilton, Ontario. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be an interesting thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Forward Batouly Camara, a native of Manhattan and a transfer from Kentucky who is practicing with UConn but not playing this season, is a Muslim whose parents immigrated from the West African nation Guinea.'b'Her mother, who holds dual citizenship, has been reluctant to travel back to Guinea, where she runs an orphanage, Ms. Camara said, even though Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s travel ban does not target the country. But she added, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t feel anything harsh or anything at all\xe2\x80\x9d toward the president.'b'Ms. Camara said she had received \xe2\x80\x9can overwhelming amount of support\xe2\x80\x9d from teammates, coaches and others in the UConn community, for which she was grateful.'b'She said she expected the team to stick together in making a decision about the White House. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we decided to go and do something there,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Camara said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat could be a platform for us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The family of Ms. Collier, the sophomore forward, has a history of political involvement. Her paternal grandfather, Gershon Collier, was a diplomat in the West African nation Sierra Leone who helped secure the country\xe2\x80\x99s independence from Britain in 1961. He later became its ambassador to the United States and chief justice.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a really touchy subject,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Collier said of a potential visit to the White House. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, personally, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really support Trump, but I would still go out of respect for my team. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how everybody else feels about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe kind of try to stay away from politics a little bit, especially because it\xe2\x80\x99s getting so heated.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Williams, UConn\xe2\x80\x99s best player, said her personal view would be to visit the White House.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt shows, despite my feelings, or anyone\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, that\xe2\x80\x99s just kind of the respectful thing to do,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding that it \xe2\x80\x9ckind of makes you look like the bigger person, too.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cto each his own, and people are free to make their own decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'ROCKY BOY\xe2\x80\x99S RESERVATION, Mont. \xe2\x80\x94 For the herd of bighorn sheep, the rocky cliffs were a safe place, with 360-degree views and plenty of nooks to blend into the gray rocks. The ground was sprinkled with scat, and the air carried a scent like a barnyard. Thousands of feet below, the landscape unfurled into a smooth checkerboard of ranch land that stretched to the horizon. The only threat up here would be to newborn lambs, susceptible to being plucked away by eagles.'b'Crouched behind a stand of rocks last spring, Brendan Burns, a 38-year-old with a growing reputation as sheep hunter and guide, peered over the edge, careful not to be seen or heard. Wild sheep have acute senses, and when they spook, they bolt as one, like a flock of birds. But the sheep were not home. Amid the panorama below, Burns spotted a constellation of tiny dots in a faraway meadow. The horns gave them away.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere aren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of circles in the wild,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you see something curved \xe2\x80\x94 and they kind of shine, they have this kind of glow to them \xe2\x80\x94 you learn to pick them up. You just train your eye to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He pulled a high-powered Swarovski scope from his pack and aimed it downhill. Eight years before, there were no sheep here. Then 21 ewes and five juvenile rams were transplanted to the Rocky Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Reservation of the Chippewa Cree, which straddles part of the Bears Paw Mountains, an islandlike rise on the plains.'b'The herd quickly grew to 100, and 40 were relocated to South Dakota. It has again grown over 100, and another 40 are likely to be transplanted this spring, part of broad attempts to replant sheep populations that are a fraction of what they once were in the West.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s obviously no coyotes around, for them to be that low and feel comfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns whispered. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a nice day to be a sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There were more sheep on a closer ridge, but in this group, Burns counted 38, including 11 rams.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat gray one in the middle is the oldest one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll probably come back and hunt him in the fall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A man from Michigan had paid $100,000 for the year\xe2\x80\x99s only chance to hunt one sheep in the herd on the Rocky Boy\xe2\x80\x99s Reservation. Burns brought him there in October, and the men traipsed through the steep and rocky terrain for days before getting themselves in position for a clean shot. The ram was 10 years old, with a scar on its forehead, a cloudy eye and several missing teeth.'b'Its massive horns and about 80 pounds of meat were hauled back to Michigan. In exchange, the Chippewa Cree tribe at Rocky Boy\xe2\x80\x99s received the $100,000, which was used to fund two tribal game wardens overseeing wildlife on the reservation.'b'It is a paradox of hunting, rarely so conspicuous as with wild sheep: The hunters are often the primary conservationists. In 2013, a permit in Montana 'b'sold for $480,000'b', still a record. Burns assisted on that hunt, too, over 18 days in the Upper Missouri River Breaks. The result was a large ram, and hundreds of thousands of dollars that went into the budget of Montana Fish, Wildlife &amp; Parks.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as sheep-hunting being a rich man\xe2\x80\x99s sport, that\xe2\x80\x99s absolutely true,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vance Corrigan, 84, who lives along the Yellowstone River in Livingston, Mont., and is one of the most accomplished big-game hunters in the world. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if it weren\xe2\x80\x99t for the rich man, those sheep wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Non-hunters often presume that the biggest prize in North America is something large and fierce \xe2\x80\x94 some kind of bear, perhaps, or an elk, a moose or a mountain lion. But the widespread belief among serious hunters is that rams are the ultimate pursuit.'b'That is for two reasons. One, opportunities to hunt sheep are scarce, and often prohibitively expensive. Two, the hunts are among the most difficult, often lasting weeks in some of the most remote regions on Earth.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor 100 years, it\xe2\x80\x99s been somewhat at the pinnacle of big-game hunting, especially in the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bob Anderson, a hunter and author of books on sheep-hunting. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there weren\xe2\x80\x99t a lot of people or sheep on the mountains. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s become a cocktail party of sorts. Some well-to-do people have gotten into it, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve driven the market up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the 'b'Wild Sheep Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s'b' convention each January, single hunting permits from various states, provinces and Indian reservations are auctioned off to the highest bidders. Most go for well more than $100,000.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople who pay $300,000 for a tag, they just paid to recover 30 sheep to places that haven\xe2\x80\x99t had sheep in 100 years,\xe2\x80\x9d Corrigan said. \xe2\x80\x9cLewis and Clark saw sheep on every ridge. Those people buying tags are helping put sheep back where they were before we arrived.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Globally, there are 'b'dozens of species and subspecies of wild sheep'b', many in Central Asia. The Wild Sheep Foundation, based in Bozeman, Mont., considers there to be four primary wild sheep in North America: the 'b'Rocky Mountain bighorn'b'; the 'b'desert bighorn'b' (in the American Southwest and Mexico); 'b'Dall\xe2\x80\x99s sheep'b' (commonly called Dall sheep, in Alaska, British Columbia, the Northwest Territories and the Yukon); 'b'Stone\xe2\x80\x99s sheep'b' (or Stone sheep, in British Columbia and the Yukon).'b'Dall\xe2\x80\x99s and Stone\xe2\x80\x99s sheep are considered thinhorns, in contrast to bighorns. Another subspecies, the 'b'Sierra Nevada bighorn'b', is federally protected, with population figures in the hundreds.'b'Some have estimated that there were millions of wild sheep in North America 200 years ago. But by the 1950s, squeezed out by people and livestock and decimated by diseases (especially carried by domestic sheep), the wild sheep population dwindled into the tens of thousands.'b'Conservation efforts saved the sheep and have expanded their territory again, often by transplanting herds and greatly limiting hunting opportunities. It is estimated that there are now nearly 200,000 wild sheep in North America.'b'The privilege of killing one (or \xe2\x80\x9charvesting\xe2\x80\x9d one, in a hunting euphemism) remains limited to the very few. It requires a lot of money or a lot of luck.'b'The United States 'b'Fish and Wildlife Service'b' estimates that there are more than 10 million big-game hunters in the United States. But only about 2,500 wild sheep are hunted each year across North America, a fraction compared with nearly every other animal.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re like the collector\xe2\x80\x99s edition Ferrari,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lance Kronberger, who owns 'b'Freelance Outdoor Adventures'b' in Alaska and guides big-game hunts of all kinds. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s 200 of them made, and you have to get lucky to get one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Generally, there are two ways to hunt wild sheep. One is hunting\xe2\x80\x99s version of the lottery \xe2\x80\x94 pay a few dollars and apply for one of the limited number of licenses that are restricted to certain territories and raffled off. Odds of winning can be infinitesimal. In Montana, 19,439 applications were submitted by state residents in 2015; licenses went to 111, a success rate of 'b'about 1 in 200.'b' Nonresidents have a tougher time.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been putting in for a sheep tag since I was 12 years old and never gotten one, and I\xe2\x80\x99m 67,\xe2\x80\x9d said George Dieruf, whose father opened Powder Horn Outfitters in downtown Bozeman in 1946. It is now part of 'b'Schnee\xe2\x80\x99s'b', another outdoors institution, and Dieruf oversees the hunting department. Its high walls are crowded with taxidermy animals the family has collected from all over the world.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had moose tags,\xe2\x80\x9d Dieruf said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I\xe2\x80\x99d trade all four for one sheep.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The second way to secure a chance at a wild sheep is to spend a lot of money. While residents of Alaska and those in Canada generally can hunt sheep within their own state, province or territory, nonresidents are required to hire a registered outfitter. The laws of supply and demand push the price of hunting a Dall\xe2\x80\x99s up to about $25,000 and a Stone\xe2\x80\x99s sheep to about $50,000. Hunts in Mexico, through outfitters or private landowners, can reach $100,000.'b'A wealthy few go beyond that. They bid on exclusive permits that are auctioned off annually to raise money for states, provinces and Indian reservations, seeing their lavish spending as a charitable donation, a tax write-off and a chance to capture one of hunting\xe2\x80\x99s premier trophies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome rich people are into yachts or floor tickets to the Lakers,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome sheep-hunt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What they are not buying is an easy trophy. Sheep live in steep and treeless terrain, above the timberline in the mountains or in the rugged hills of the desert. Sheep hunts can take hunters into places few humans have gone, and can include weeks of trekking and stalking.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor the true hunter, you can\xe2\x80\x99t buy them behind the fence,\xe2\x80\x9d Kronberger said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to climb the mountain. The fat, rich guy is going to have a much harder time. Anybody can kill a bear if they sit on the beach or along the stream long enough. I could take a guy in a wheelchair and get him a bear. You can go and get your deer, get your elk. You can\xe2\x80\x99t do that with sheep. You have to go and get it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All that can be hard for non-hunters to understand. Those who have trophy rooms filled with a wide selection of mounts, like Corrigan and Kronberger, said that guests are rarely attracted to the sheep at first, instead taken by the more glamorous and fearsome animals. It is like a litmus test for hunting credibility.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf I brought 1,000 people into my trophy room, almost all of them would go to the bears and say, \xe2\x80\x98Wow, look at the bears,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Kronberger said. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly a few know to go to the sheep \xe2\x80\x94 the other sheep hunters. Half the time, people call the sheep a goat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Brendan Burns sat in a padded stackable chair in the Tuscany Ballroom of the Peppermill Resort Spa Casino in Reno, Nev. It was a Friday night in January, and there were about 1,000 people sitting at 100 round tables, having just eaten the one entree offered: steak. A convention of hunters was no place for a vegetarian option.'b'On stage was an auctioneer. The next item for bid, No. 15, was the California Desert Bighorn Sheep Permit. The year before, it went for $165,000, a state record.'b'Burns, a former wrestler at Ohio State, grew up in Montana. He is lean, as if still making weight, and keeps his hair to little more than the stubble of a three-day beard. Away from the hunt, he often wears crisp, untucked oxfords, and when he stands, he stuffs his hands into the front pockets of his jeans and rocks on his sneakers.'b'He wears few signs that he is a world-class hunter or an executive for 'b'KUIU'b', a fast-growing gear and apparel company. Named for an island in southeastern Alaska and pronounced KOO-yoo, it has, in just a few years, positioned itself as a Patagonia or The North Face of the camouflage set.'b'Burns held his phone to his ear. The voice on the other side belonged to Jason Hairston, KUIU\xe2\x80\x99s 45-year-old founder. A former linebacker at the University of California at Davis, Hairston long ago saw a business opportunity for high-end gear marketed specifically to hunters. In 2005, he and a partner launched 'b'Sitka'b'. It grew exponentially and was sold, leaving Hairston in 2011 to start KUIU, a direct-to-consumer maker of expedition-ready gear designed to handle the worst elements a hunter might face \xe2\x80\x94 something like a sheep hunt.'b'The first person Hairston hired at KUIU was Burns, whose title is guide and outfitters program director.'b'Among Hairston\xe2\x80\x99s friends is Donald Trump Jr., a son of the president and an avid big-game hunter.'b'It was why Hairston missed the sheep convention for the first time in years. He was in Washington, as a guest of the Trumps. The night of the auction for the California permit was the day of the presidential inauguration.'b'Hairston wanted the California permit. He saw it as a way to pay back his home state and an appropriate place to finish his \xe2\x80\x9cgrand slam,\xe2\x80\x9d the term applied to those who have killed all four types of the North American wild sheep. ('b'Grand Slam/Ovis'b' officially tracks grand slams \xe2\x80\x94 it has documented more than 1,500 legally taken grand slams \xe2\x80\x94 and claims rights to the phrase among hunters.) A year earlier, he was the last one to drop out of the bidding.'b'Hairston was in a tuxedo at an inaugural ball at the Trump International Hotel. He handed the phone to his wife, Kirstyn, who wore a white strapless gown. Afraid that her husband might drop out and be left disappointed again, she wanted to do the bidding through Burns. She took the phone to a quiet corner and left Hairston alone to wait for the result.'b'Donald Trump Jr. approached Hairston moments later and asked where Kristyn was. Told that she was bidding on the California tag, Trump waited, too, curious to know how it turned out.'b'The auctioneer opened the bidding at $100,000. Patrolling the floor, wearing cowboy hats, were a dozen bid spotters. One parked himself in front of Burns, who had his phone to his ear and no expression on his face.'b'Four other bidders quickly took the tag to $135,000. Burns whispered into the phone, then nodded to the spotter. Hundred-and-fifty, Burns mouthed, and the spotter shouted it back to the auctioneer and the crowd let out a cheer. Burns hoped it would end there.'b'But the price nudged up, $5,000 at a time, until it was Burns and one other bidder somewhere in the back of the huge ballroom. Eyes forward, face in poker mode, the price already a record, Burns nodded to $180,000, then to $190,000. The person in back kept delaying, testing the auctioneer\xe2\x80\x99s voice and patience, before ratcheting the price farther.'b'At $195,000, Burns turned to see if he could see whom he was bidding against. He could not. He put up two fingers for $200,000. \xe2\x80\x9cLadies and gentlemen, $200,000!\xe2\x80\x9d the auctioneer shouted. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s keep it going!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The pace of his opponent slowed. Burns was decisive. After he nodded to $235,000, there was no response from the back. The tag, going once, going twice, was sold. The crowd applauded. Burns ended the call and people shook his hand.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was more than she wanted to pay, but she never hesitated,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns said.'b'In Washington, Hairston hugged his wife and high-fived Trump, who asked if he could come along on the hunt.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a particular sheep that we know about, and that the outfitter working with the other bidder knows about, and it could be a state record,\xe2\x80\x9d Hairston said a few days later. \xe2\x80\x9cThat drove the price up. But he\xe2\x80\x99s old. He\xe2\x80\x99s 11 or 12. The question is whether he\xe2\x80\x99ll still be alive, if he\xe2\x80\x99ll make it through this winter. And then the question is whether we can find him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sheep hunters sometimes stalk their future prey for years. That familiarity, rare in hunting, leads to enough of a connection that hunters often name rams that they hope to someday hunt. Hairston called this particular one Goliath.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are no guarantees,\xe2\x80\x9d Hairston said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe hunt starts Nov. 1. That\xe2\x80\x99s about when the rut starts, and during the rut he sometimes moves out of the area where you can hunt. That\xe2\x80\x99s been the challenge with this sheep in the past.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Whether he gets a ram or not, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife receives 95 percent of the auction price \xe2\x80\x94 in this case, a record $223,250. That is fed into a general big-game budget of about $10 million, according to Regina Abella, California\xe2\x80\x99s desert bighorn sheep coordinator. The money pays for sheep-specific employees and conservation efforts, like helicopter surveys and captures to test the animals for disease and collar them to track their health and movements. (Another major funding mechanism for American wildlife conservation comes through the 'b'Pittman-Robertson Act'b', which taxes hunting goods, like rifles and bows.)'b'No other game tags come close to creating the kind of revenues that the sheep tag does, Abella said. The elk tag might attract $30,000.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe sheep tag, it\xe2\x80\x99s a whole other level,\xe2\x80\x9d Abella said.'b'The 30 or so tags auctioned annually at the convention tend to draw bids from a small circle of wealthy hunters, perhaps 25 of them. Many have someone else do the bidding for them, even if they are in the ballroom, too.'b'Such anonymity helps keep other potential bidders from knowing whom they are competing against for a coveted tag. More important, perhaps, it helps avoid the publicity that can fuel hunting\xe2\x80\x99s critics.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome of the big donors are C.E.O.s and presidents of large companies,\xe2\x80\x9d Hairston said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think anybody, as a hunter, has a fear of saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re a hunter. But in their role professionally, the concern is how it potentially affects their business.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jimmy John Liautaud, founder of the sandwich chain that bears his name, is a frequent bidder for sheep tags, including the one for British Columbia that he bought this year, by phone, for $210,000. Liautaud found himself in the sights of anti-hunters in 2015 when pictures from five years earlier surfaced showing him with dead elephants, a rhinoceros and a leopard shot in Africa. He has since said that he no longer hunts big game in Africa, but he does make frequent trips for sheep and other animals in Asia.'b'He successfully bid on the Montana Governor\xe2\x80\x99s Permit four times since 2009, for a total of more than $1 million. In 2013, he lost out to Douglas Leech, a former bank executive from West Virginia, who paid $480,000 for the tag, still a record.'b'Like Liautaud, Leech declined to be interviewed.'b'Combined, the auction of about 30 permits over three nights in Reno raises about $3 million annually. The Wild Sheep Foundation adds money to that total and, last year, gave about $4.7 million to conservation efforts, mostly through state and provincial game departments or directly to Indian reservations.'b'Donations come in other forms, too. Liautaud recently spent about $3 million for a three-mile fence near the Taos Pueblo reservation in New Mexico, according to reservation officials, along a stretch where sheep from a growing herd were getting hit on a highway.'b'But the conservation efforts have created a Catch-22. Sheep numbers are on the rise, leading some states to raise the number of permits available through the lotteries, to cull old rams and help keep populations down in specific areas. In turn, more hunters can increase competition for top rams, which can lower the price the wealthy are willing to pay for an auction tag, thus hurting the budgets of those involved in conservation.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a concern for those, like Bob Anderson, the historian of hunting, who have witnessed all the positive changes over recent decades.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some fear,\xe2\x80\x9d Anderson said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat sheep hunting will strangle on its success.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ray Alt, a slight 76-year-old with his shirt tucked into his Wranglers, opened the door to his stone house in Livingston, Mont., where he was born and raised. The heads and horns of three sheep were mounted high on the living room wall. Around a corner and down some stairs was a trophy room, which used to be the garage, its walls filled with animals that Alt shot, with a bow or rifle, over a lifetime of hunting. The first animal he got as a boy, with a bow, was a porcupine. His favorites, though, are the sheep. He has eight of them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s sheep fever,\xe2\x80\x9d Alt said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to explain it. It\xe2\x80\x99s the love of the curly horns, I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Despite his fascination, it took Alt 46 years to get one of each kind in North America, the last a desert bighorn in 2014. The first ram he got was in 1968, snowshoeing through the nearby 'b'Beartooth Mountains'b', a vast and wickedly rugged landscape just north of Yellowstone National Park. The Beartooth Mountains are the only place where hunters in the lower 48 states can buy a permit over the counter, for $125, and try their luck at sheep hunting. But it\xe2\x80\x99s a daunting exercise, one of the toughest hunts possible. The area is nearly a million acres, with perhaps just 10 rams of legal age and size.'b'But in 1968, Alt shot one with a bow, a ram so big that it held up as the record for 12 years. It hung unblinking in his trophy room. The fat horns were ringed, one for each year, which is how hunters determine a ram\xe2\x80\x99s age, and the tips were battle-worn and ragged, or \xe2\x80\x9cbroomed\xe2\x80\x9d in hunting parlance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you get to an older, broomed ram, they are special animals,\xe2\x80\x9d Alt said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs they grow, they are closer to a full curl and bust off the ends of the horns. An older broomed ram, he\xe2\x80\x99s like a monarch.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Burns grew up in Livingston and considers Alt a mentor. Like Alt and other guides, Burns has assisted on many hunts but could not afford to buy a tag at auction. For years, he applied for tags through the lottery system, to no avail. He said he spent about $4,500 a year to enter drawings.'b'In 2012, a friend sent Burns a photograph of a magnificent ram he had seen during a deer hunt in the 'b'Bob Marshall Wilderness'b', more than a million acres of forest and granite straddling the Continental Divide south of Glacier National Park. Burns made the photo his screen saver and the ram his quest. He repeatedly applied for one of that area\xe2\x80\x99s two annual tags, and had about a 1-in-30 chance of getting it.'b'His name was drawn in 2015.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe big question was if he was still alive,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns said.'b'That fall, Burns spent 22 days wandering the Bob, as it is called, carrying a bow and searching for his sheep. He figures he walked about 150 miles.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI equate finding a big ram with walking into a big gravel pit, looking for a diamond,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns said.'b'He found 36 rams in his first 18 days, but not the one he was looking for. He made mental notes, thinking which one would be his second choice or his third. But the three-year-old photo he carried also showed two younger rams in the frame. To Burns and other sheep hunters, each ram looks different than others, the way identical twins are easily distinguished by family and friends. He had not seen any of those in the photo.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was missing one band of rams,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI figured my ram was in it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He found them on Day 23, after he heard the clash of butting heads over a ridge. He saw the ram he wanted. Using a satellite phone, he called the friend who first spotted the ram three years before and asked him to come. The friend hiked 10 hours overnight to be there for the kill.'b'That morning, Burns silently slipped himself into position, looking for the right angle. \xe2\x80\x9cWith rifle hunting, they say that when you\xe2\x80\x99re 200 yards away, it\xe2\x80\x99s game over,\xe2\x80\x9d Burns said. \xe2\x80\x9cWith a bow, the game\xe2\x80\x99s just starting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He managed to get closer, but the herd smelled him before he could get an open shot. The sheep shuffled away and settled again. Burns positioned himself within about 80 yards. Back home, Burns practices from that distance daily with his bow, shooting into a life-size Dall\xe2\x80\x99s sheep made of foam. The arrow travels about 300 feet a second, and Burns rarely misses.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI literally told myself, \xe2\x80\x98I shoot this shot every day,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Burns said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98I got it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The arrow pierced the ram behind the front shoulder. It ran about 100 yards, dropped and died. Burns and his friend skinned and cleaned the animal. They packed out nearly 100 pounds of meat, 50 pounds of the skull and horns, and the sheep\xe2\x80\x99s full cape. They left behind just bones and guts, sure to be cleaned quickly to nothing but a white skeleton by wolves or coyotes.'b'The ram was 13\xc2\xbd years old, the oldest of the more than 100 rams killed in Montana in 2015. Its horns, measured with a formula that combines length and mass, scored 189\xe2\x85\x9d, believed to be the biggest ram killed by a bow in North America that year. At the Wild Sheep Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s show in Reno, Burns won the award for \xe2\x80\x9ctop archery bighorn,\xe2\x80\x9d proclaimed on a big belt buckle presented in a wooden case.'b'A few months after the hunt, several pounds of the ram\xe2\x80\x99s meat sizzled on the backyard barbecue, and the skull and massive horns sat on a garage workbench. The skull was still red and unbleached. Burns figured he would someday get it mounted, but said that the prize was the memory, not the trophy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was the greatest hunt of my life,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time I see him, I smile.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'MONACO \xe2\x80\x94 Looking back, Vadim Vasilyev can pinpoint the precise moment A.S. Monaco changed. Vasilyev, the club\xe2\x80\x99s vice president, can name a place \xe2\x80\x94 the Grimaldi Forum, a grand conference center on the Monte Carlo seafront \xe2\x80\x94 and a date: Sept. 21, 2015.'b'That evening, around 1,000 of Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s most ardent fans packed into a hall to hear what Vasilyev \xe2\x80\x94 accompanied by Leonardo Jardim, the club\xe2\x80\x99s coach, and J\xc3\xa9r\xc3\xa9my Toulalan, its captain then \xe2\x80\x94 had to say for himself.'b'Over the previous two summers, those fans had watched as one of the most ambitious projects in European soccer seemed to crumble. Monaco had spent hundreds of millions of dollars acquiring some of soccer\xe2\x80\x99s brightest stars; now they were all being allowed to leave.'b'James Rodr\xc3\xadguez went to Real Madrid in 2014; a year later, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco joined him across the city at Atl\xc3\xa9tico; Radamel Falcao joined Manchester United, then Chelsea; Geoffrey Kondogbia left for Inter Milan.'b'And then, a few weeks before the meeting in Monte Carlo and on the eve of the season, Anthony Martial, a young French forward of blistering promise, had been sold to United. In 12 months, Monaco had gone from a boutique of shimmering luxury to an apparently endless fire sale. The fans wanted answers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey were really angry,\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had many departures that summer. They needed someone to go out and face them.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the course of several hours \xe2\x80\x94 at first onstage, and then over drinks and petits fours \xe2\x80\x94 Vasilyev did just that.'b'It was a \xe2\x80\x9ctough\xe2\x80\x9d evening, he said; the correspondent from the fans\xe2\x80\x99 website, 'b'Planete ASM'b', delicately described the discussion as \xe2\x80\x9copen, honest and taboo free.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was not the time to hide,\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev said. \xe2\x80\x9cI decided to go out in front of them and say we had no other way. I asked them, \xe2\x80\x98Do you want to go back to the second division?\xe2\x80\x99 I said it will be tough, but this is the road now.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was difficult, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the end, they started asking me for pictures. That evening was the turning point.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just how drastic the transformation has been should be amply demonstrated when Monaco faces Manchester City in the round of 16 of the Champions League on Tuesday.'b'The glamour conjured by the club\xe2\x80\x99s name remains, of course, too intricately woven into the fabric of the team to ever disappear. Monaco is still partly owned by the royal family; its players still wear a jersey inspired, according to the officially endorsed history, by Princess Grace; its home, the Stade Louis II, is still nestled between two marinas, thronged with superyachts. It is still, and always will be, the team from the billionaire\xe2\x80\x99s playground.'b'Since that fractious evening in the Grimaldi Forum, though, Monaco has completely discarded its identity as the team run as if it were a billionaire\xe2\x80\x99s plaything.'b'That is what Monaco was not so long ago, of course, when its benefactor, Dmitry Rybolovlev, bankrolled a spending spree impressive even by European soccer\xe2\x80\x99s inflated standards.'b'Rybolovlev, a Russian petrochemical magnate, bought the club in 2011 when it was languishing in France\xe2\x80\x99s second division.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven then, he told me quite a few times that his ambition was to win the Champions League,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tor-Kristian Karlsen, who became Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s sporting director in January 2012.'b'Rybolovlev poured money into his scouting system and brought in a high-profile manager, Claudio Ranieri. Rybolovlev commissioned a host of signings, most notably the Argentine teenager Lucas Ocampos, a deal inspired by Rybolovlev\xe2\x80\x99s desire to sign \xe2\x80\x9cthe most promising teenager in the world who was attainable,\xe2\x80\x9d Karlsen said.'b'More important, at Karlsen\xe2\x80\x99s instigation, Rybolovlev established contacts with Jorge Mendes, the most influential agent in the sport. The relationship would prove crucial when Monaco was promoted, in 2013, and promptly signed three of the most expensive players in French league history: Rodr\xc3\xadguez, Falcao and Jo\xc3\xa3o Moutinho, all Mendes players, among several others.'b'Monaco seemed the most potent of European soccer\xe2\x80\x99s cadre of arriviste clubs, doubling down on the pattern set by Chelsea, Manchester City and Paris St.-Germain. Four years on, though, only echoes of that era remain: Moutinho and Falcao, who returned last year, will both be in Manchester this week. The club around them is almost the polar opposite to the one they joined.'b'Jardim\xe2\x80\x99s team is built around young talent; Vasilyev declares with pride that Monaco is self-financing and sustainable. Karlsen said Rybolovlev was always \xe2\x80\x9cinterested in buying players of a certain age, from certain places, to find out if we could benefit from the transfer market,\xe2\x80\x9d even when he was purchasing stars. Now it is those players \xe2\x80\x94 the promising and the hungry \xe2\x80\x94 who are Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s sole focus.'b'The result has been eye-catching. Monaco is in the knockout stages of the Champions League and, more impressive, atop Ligue 1, which many had expected to be a cakewalk for Paris St.-Germain. Monaco is enjoying rather more success as a hothouse for talent than it did as a retreat for stars.'b'And yet, as Vasilyev said, that change was \xe2\x80\x9cnot really part of the plan.\xe2\x80\x9d Monaco always intended to change, but \xe2\x80\x9cnot so quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'By the time of that meeting in the Grimaldi Forum, it had become clear there was no other choice. In part, Vasilyev attributes that to errors he and Rybolovlev made: They expected big-name players to draw both sponsors and fans, but they did not. Commercial deals did not materialize. Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s famously sparse crowds did not improve. The club\xe2\x80\x99s revenue would never catch up with its expenditure.'b'In addition, the year that Monaco\xe2\x80\x99s spending stunned Europe, when Falcao and the rest arrived, was the year that UEFA\xe2\x80\x99s financial fair-play regulations \xe2\x80\x94 designed to force clubs to live within their means \xe2\x80\x94 started to bite.'b'By the end of that season, Manchester City and P.S.G. had been fined, and placed under transfer restrictions, for breaching the rules. Vasilyev, too, was summoned to Nyon, Switzerland, where UEFA is headquartered, and asked to explain his club\xe2\x80\x99s finances. Monaco, too, faced onerous penalties.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started, the rules of financial fair play existed but had not been implemented,\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev said. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody really knew how real it would be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When it became clear it was very real indeed, Monaco knew it had to change tack. Rybolovlev scaled back his spending in 2014, and sold Rodr\xc3\xadguez, too; by 2015, the exodus was in full flow.'b'In hindsight, it would be easy for Monaco to resent its compliance with the regulations, which have since been watered down. As Vasilyev points out, the rules still exist, but they look more like guidelines now. If Monaco had gritted its teeth and accepted the fines \xe2\x80\x94 as Manchester City and P.S.G. did \xe2\x80\x94 it might still have its team of stars.'b'Vasilyev expressed some regret. \xe2\x80\x9cWe went to extremes to be in compliance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSome other clubs took it less seriously and got off with it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A better word, though, might be serendipity. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the end, it was a good thing for us,\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev said of the financial fair-play regulations. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is one of the reasons we were galvanized to change and find our proper model.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Monaco is in no doubt that while it might have come to this road by accident, it is a happy one. It has a team filled with bright promise and a growing reputation as the ideal place for prodigies. Last summer, Djibril Sidib\xc3\xa9, a defender, chose Monaco ahead of Arsenal.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe knows if he excels here, he will then be able to choose any club at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev said.'b'Monaco knows its place, knows that sooner or later it will have to cash in on its prospects and allow them to fly the nest. It does so, though, only when the time is right: A $65 million offer from China\xe2\x80\x99s Tianjin Quanjian in January for the resurgent Falcao was turned down.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEventually, we are a selling club,\xe2\x80\x9d Vasilyev said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we do not have to sell if we do not want to.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That was the plan Vasilyev laid out that evening at the Grimaldi Forum: a road that took the club off in a different direction, but one that may yet lead to the same destination.'b'The Iron Horse had brass fixtures in his house. And galvanized steel wiring. He also had clapboard siding, parquet floors and a screened-in porch.'b''b'Lou Gehrig'b', the 'b'Yankees'b'\xe2\x80\x99 iconic first baseman, bought the home in 'b'New Rochelle'b', N.Y., in December 1927, just two months after completing one of the most successful seasons any major league hitter has ever had, culminating in a World Series title. He then refurbished the three-bedroom structure to accommodate both himself and his parents, taking great care to turn it into a place they would all feel proud to call home.'b'But today the old house, while still maintaining some of Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s handiwork, sits cold and neglected, in search of a new owner.'b'Arthur Scinta, a local preservationist and architectural historian, hopes the house, 13 miles north of Yankee Stadium, can be restored and preserved in the style in which Gehrig fashioned it, perhaps even turned into a Lou Gehrig museum.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can still feel Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the house,\xe2\x80\x9d Scinta said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would be a shame if all that was lost.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the house, it turns out, also has a puzzling history \xe2\x80\x94 specifically, it was foreclosed on in 1937 while Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Christina and Heinrich, still owned it.'b'Gehrig bought the house, at 9 Meadow Lane, in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s name, taking over an existing mortgage of $10,000, according to 1927 records. Gehrig and his parents then moved in shortly after Christmas, with Gehrig working hard to fix it up to his liking.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot a bad joint, is it?\xe2\x80\x9d he was quoted in a story published in The New York Sun on Jan. 9, 1928. \xe2\x80\x9cNot a new place, but it will be as good as new when I get \xe2\x80\x99er all dolled up. It was a Christmas gift to my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gehrig, whose appearance in 2,130 consecutive games earned him the nickname the Iron Horse, is described in the Sun story as being covered in paint and plaster as he worked on the house. He lived there, with his parents, until he moved out in 1933 after marrying 'b'Eleanor Twitchell'b'. In all, Gehrig won two World Series titles while residing at that address. Another local newspaper described him playing ball with local children across the street.'b'But on Sept. 11, 1937, according to a deed in the Westchester County clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office, Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s mother and father lost the house in foreclosure. The new deed awarded the property to the children of an earlier owner, Alexander List, who died in 1932 and whose family held the mortgage while the Gehrigs lived there, records show.'b'At the request of The New York Times, the Westchester County clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office uncovered the case files from the foreclosure in a warehouse in Elmsford. They show that the Gehrigs missed a semiannual payment of $255 on May 9, 1937. The failure to pay set off a clause in the mortgage that allowed the List children, as executors of their father\xe2\x80\x99s will, to call in the balance (about $8,800).'b'Christina Gehrig did not pay what was owed and did not appear for the hearing at the Supreme Court in Westchester County, the records show. The house was then awarded to the List children in foreclosure.'b'There is no explanation of why the Gehrigs did not pay and what role, if any, their son played in the case.'b'In 1937, Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s last season as a formidable player, he made $31,000, according to the Baseball Reference website. That was a substantial amount of money back then, and presumably Gehrig would have been able to pay his parents\xe2\x80\x99 mortgage while also taking care of his own expenses.'b'Jonathan Eig, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cLuckiest Man,\xe2\x80\x9d the 'b'well-regarded 2005 biography of Gehrig'b', said he had not been aware of the foreclosure. He said Gehrig \xe2\x80\x9cwas extremely careful with money,\xe2\x80\x9d but also pointed to the well-known tensions between Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s wife and his mother as a possible explanation for what occurred.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEleanor had a very strained relationship with Christina Gehrig,\xe2\x80\x9d Eig said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible that she forbade Lou from giving them the money to save the house. Or perhaps his parents were ready to move out, anyway. There may be no way of knowing for certain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is possible, too, that Gehrig was not even aware of the foreclosure. Perhaps he and his parents decided collectively to walk away from the mortgage, although that kind of behavior was not consistent with the family\xe2\x80\x99s history.'b'After the foreclosure, Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s parents moved to nearby Mount Vernon. Christina Gehrig moved to Milford, Conn., in 1948 after Heinrich passed away. She died there in 1954 at the age of 72.'b'Sometime after the Gehrigs moved out of the New Rochelle house, Walter and Josephine Sears moved in as tenants. The couple appear on the 1940 census as living in the house with their daughters, Mary Ann, 11, and Joan, 7.'b'All these years later, the daughters still live in the area.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a lovely home; I wish I lived there now, \xe2\x80\x9d said Joan Straehle, 84, formerly Joan Sears. She remembered being in a second-floor bedroom on the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the day of the attack on Pearl Harbor. That was six months after Gehrig, then 37 and living in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which became known as Lou Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s Disease.'b'Walter Sears was a World War I veteran who, his daughters say, had been gassed and taken prisoner by the Germans. He later rented the old Gehrig house from the List family. Straehle and her older sister, now Mary Ann Prunty, recalled details of living there \xe2\x80\x94 how they did their homework on a staircase landing, how the basement flooded after it rained and that the tree in the front yard where Mary Ann liked to go and daydream.'b'The sisters also recalled the day in 1941 when the Samuel Goldwyn production company came to New Rochelle to take photos of the house for its coming Gehrig movie, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Pride of the Yankees'b',\xe2\x80\x9d featuring Gary Cooper. The girls stayed home from school as their parents gave the Hollywood visitors a tour.'b'A year later, their mother wrote to Goldwyn complaining that while she and her husband had provided full access to their home, they never received complimentary tickets to the film, as their father had requested. The letter is in the Samuel Goldwyn Collection at the Margaret Herrick Library in Beverly Hills.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was Daddy,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Prunty said with a laugh.'b'The City of New Rochelle has now put up a sign commemorating the street on which the house stands as Lou Gehrig Way. Scinta is eager to do more. He wants to save the house from losing its connection to Gehrig.'b'The house, which needs work, was bought in another foreclosure last year for $303,000 by a real estate broker, Karan Garewal, and a partner. In a telephone interview, Garewal described the purchase as an investment and said it was now listed for sale again at $449,000.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe hope the new owner will be someone who appreciates the history of it,\xe2\x80\x9d Garewal said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is like a piece of art in that sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'During a recent tour, Scinta pointed out the dining room\xe2\x80\x99s stippled stucco walls, which he believes Gehrig did himself because of the style of the time. There is also an oak, pull-chain toilet tank; gaslight fixtures in the attic; and a row of old sinks in the basement.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is unusual to have four of them lined up like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Scinta said. \xe2\x80\x9cWho knows, maybe Christina Gehrig washed Lou\xe2\x80\x99s uniform there?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Scinta has envisioned the Yankees buying the house and preserving it and perhaps even using it as housing for players called up from the minors. The Yankees, however, are not in the home-preservation business, but might contribute financially if the house becomes a nonprofit museum.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLou Gehrig is a cherished figure in Yankee lore,\xe2\x80\x9d said Randy Levine, the president of the Yankees. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure there would be a lot of interest in preserving his legacy in that way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gehrig\xe2\x80\x99s legacy includes a .340 batting average in his 17 years with the Yankees, and only the Yankees. He hit 493 home runs and collected two most valuable player awards and achieved one triple crown. His consecutive-games streak, which Cal Ripken Jr. broke in 1995, still resonates.'b'Part of that body of work was produced while Gehrig lived at 9 Meadow Lane in New Rochelle. For now, at least, the house endures just as Gehrig once did, game after game, year after year.'b'REGGIO EMILIA, Italy \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Mike Piazza'b' was jet-lagged and hungry, though you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have known it from his smile as he navigated the obstacle course of hugs, kisses and handshakes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHey! Ciao! Good to see you!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'It has been 10 years since Piazza, 48, retired from baseball as one of the best-hitting catchers in history. It is common for stars of his stature to try out second careers in broadcasting, or simply to luxuriate in endless rounds of golf. Piazza last year decided he would become the majority owner of a third-division Italian soccer club, Reggiana.'b'And so today, one year after his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame, the focus of Piazza\xe2\x80\x99s professional life is here in Reggio Emilia, a picturesque city 100 miles south of Milan \xe2\x80\x94 and about 5,000 miles from his home in Miami. Here, most people view the American pastime, if they know it at all, as a faraway curiosity. The locals understood that Piazza was famous when he arrived, but they needed Google to discover the reason. The level of renown he earns here will depend entirely on his ability to execute an ambitious plan to lift his beleaguered club back to the top flight of Italian soccer.'b'So he kept moving on that recent Sunday morning, doling out bilingual small talk around the V.I.P. lounge of Reggiana\xe2\x80\x99s stadium before a recent game against Modena, a nearby rival. Cigarette smoke and the faint echoes of fans\xe2\x80\x99 chants wafted in from the stands. Parmigiano-Reggiano from a local sponsor was carved and shoveled onto plates of pumpkin tortellini. Finally, palms pressed and pleasantries exchanged, Piazza stole away to a modest private box where he could reflect on his professional transformation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI remember, as a player, complaining if we had a small plane,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get a 757? We had to get a 737? That\xe2\x80\x99s garbage. The owners are cheap.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow switch to me as the owner. I go: \xe2\x80\x98What the hell? One hundred dollars a room? Where are you guys staying, the Four Seasons?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the game began, Piazza found himself fixated on how the rainy weather had affected ticket sales. While play crackled below him, he timed a rotating advertisement screen near the stands. Soon, Maurizio Franzone, the team\xe2\x80\x99s general manager, joined Piazza and his guests in the outdoor viewing area, and for the next two hours Piazza peppered him with questions about players and tactics.'b'It was Franzone who first made contact with Reggiana\xe2\x80\x99s previous owners on Dec. 10, 2015. Piazza and Franzone have been friends for years, and they had long discussed the idea of investing in soccer. After the initial meeting, Franzone, who had spoken to about 20 other clubs in Italy, excitedly reported back to Piazza that it could be the perfect situation. Reggiana played in a large stadium that could eventually accommodate upper-league crowds. It boasted a training facility with 11 fields. It was geographically close to countless potential sponsors. It possessed a fan base desperate for brighter days.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPut it this way: This is a team that needs to come back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Franzone, 47, a former professional goalkeeper who favors three-piece suits and a finely groomed beard. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people of Reggio Emilia need it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It has not been easy being a Reggiana fan over the last two decades. In the 1990s, the club played in Serie A, the country\xe2\x80\x99s top tier, and in 1995, it opened a new stadium, which hundreds of the team\xe2\x80\x99s fans helped finance through the purchase of multiyear season ticket plans.'b'But things quickly went awry. The team was relegated in 1997, and a few years later, after going bankrupt, it was forced to surrender the title to its stadium, which had been sold at auction. Today, the arena is owned by Giorgio Squinzi, the owner of the nearby Serie A team Sassuolo. The teams share the stadium, with Reggiana paying rent \xe2\x80\x94 an arrangement that causes its fans much embarrassment.'b'But Piazza, for now, has gained the fans\xe2\x80\x99 trust. On June 18, 10 days after he announced a deal in principle to buy a majority stake in the club, thousands of fans greeted him with a rally in the main city square, serenading him with team songs. (He has declined to disclose financial details of the deal, but various local media outlets reported the investment was around $3 million.)'b'And if there was some initial concern that Piazza might be a detached foreign owner, minding his investment from overseas, he has thus far dispelled it. He has made seven trips to Italy since buying the team, embracing a life of redeye flights. He has adopted a holistic approach to player development and pondered which elements of American sports culture could work in Italy. New sponsors have signed on; old ones that had abandoned the club in its lean years have returned. The number of season-ticket holders has doubled to 5,243, up from 2,615 last season.'b'Currently Reggiana (14-5-7) sits in fourth place in the league standings.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe firmly believe in the Mike Piazza project,\xe2\x80\x9d said Stefano Cavazzoni, 46, who lives in Reggio Emilia and began following the team in the early 1980s.'b'Gabriele Miari, 30, noted that Piazza sometimes left little notes on 'b'a Facebook fan page'b' devoted to the team that Miari helps moderate. He described being at an away game this season at Lumezzane, a cold day in a nondescript city, when Piazza walked over to the stands to chat with some fans. \xe2\x80\x9cAt least it\xe2\x80\x99s not hot like Miami,\xe2\x80\x9d Piazza said sarcastically in Italian, making them laugh.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe made us feel close to him even though he\xe2\x80\x99s a very wealthy man,\xe2\x80\x9d Miari said. He shrugged when asked to rate Piazza\xe2\x80\x99s language skills. \xe2\x80\x9cHis Italian is like our English,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt needs practice.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Piazza, who took six months of Italian lessons (and acknowledges that he needs more), has been brushing up on his soccer, too. He grew up near Philadelphia and had only a passing interest in the sport until he retired. He joked that he once thought Reggiana\xe2\x80\x99s favored formation was a 4-4-3, a nonsensical configuration. But Franzone said Piazza\xe2\x80\x99s baseball career had given him credibility with players and fans alike. \xe2\x80\x9cThey know you know the smell of a locker room,\xe2\x80\x9d he often tells Piazza.'b'Sports ownership has its visceral joys, too, and Piazza was clearly enjoying himself as the game wore on. He yelled toward the field: \xe2\x80\x9cDai, dai! Atta boy! Bravo! Get that ball!\xe2\x80\x9d He drank an Aperol spritz and a few glasses of ros\xc3\xa9. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get a bad headache,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut if we pull this game out, it\xe2\x80\x99ll be worth it. It\xe2\x80\x99s two Advil.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The conversation at halftime turned to the region\xe2\x80\x99s famous gastronomic tradition, or as Piazza called it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe other reason I bought the team.\xe2\x80\x9d He breathlessly cataloged the area\xe2\x80\x99s cured meats: \xe2\x80\x9cThe prosciutto, the bresaola, the coppa, the mortadella \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s all here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Noting that he had met with groups aiming for expansion franchises in Major League Soccer before buying Reggiana, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d rather be poor in Italy than based in St. Louis. You can\xe2\x80\x99t get a good meal there!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Reggiana scored its eventual winning goal in the second half, Piazza threw a left-handed uppercut \xe2\x80\x94 balancing the wineglass in his other hand \xe2\x80\x94 and let out a prolonged yell. He cursed when a Reggiana player injured himself and again when the fourth official announced that there would be four minutes of injury time.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah!\xe2\x80\x9d Piazza said when the final whistle blared, before closing his eyes and touching his chest. \xe2\x80\x9cMamma mia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Afterward, several fans walked over to greet Piazza, addressing him as \xe2\x80\x9cPresidente\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the formality of which always makes his wife, Alicia Rickter, laugh. Piazza shook hands and posed for pictures. \xe2\x80\x9cGrazie per essere venuti,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Thank you for coming.'b'As he prepared to duck inside, an elderly man reached over to grab his hand. \xe2\x80\x9cYou bring us good luck,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said in Italian. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease come again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The next day, while eating lunch with Franzone in the city, Piazza likened owning a soccer team to harvesting macadamia trees, a process that can take five years to yield nuts. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to come into a situation where there was something to build,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Piazza has adopted the same approach to life in Italy. He was 34 when he visited Italy for the first time. He had been to Japan seven times at that point in his life, but somehow never to the home country of his paternal grandparents.'b'The trip changed him, he said. Growing up, he had absorbed a bundle of cultural idiosyncrasies \xe2\x80\x94 whether tastes, mannerisms or locutions \xe2\x80\x94 that sometimes manifested themselves explicitly or in other cases merely fizzed beneath his consciousness. In Rome, he found these stray fragments of his identity fitting naturally, exhilaratingly, into his surroundings.'b'The next year, he and his father visited Sciacca, the town on the southwestern coast of Sicily where his great-great-great-great-great-grandfather Giuseppe Piazza was born in 1789.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like a duck going back to water,\xe2\x80\x9d Piazza said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just related. I could just feel it. I just felt Italian.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'These days, Piazza has been renting a home in a village called Quattro Castella, about 10 miles south of Reggio Emilia. He has considered having his children \xe2\x80\x94 Nicoletta, 10; Paulina, 7; and Marco, 3 \xe2\x80\x94 attend Italian schools for a year.'b'In the restaurant, Piazza fiddled with the patterned scarf around his neck, joking that he accessorized like this only in Italy, where he felt sartorially inadequate alongside the locals. Scanning a menu, he made a face when he came across the horse tartare; his children were taking riding lessons, he explained.'b'Piazza is enjoying this cross-cultural learning process. He said the rigors of this new life \xe2\x80\x94 stacking airline miles, struggling with a new language, savoring new foods, connecting to his family\xe2\x80\x99s roots \xe2\x80\x94 had invigorated him in the vacuum left by baseball.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI played baseball for 16 years,\xe2\x80\x9d Piazza said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had to reconcile the fact that I\xe2\x80\x99ll never again feel the juice of hitting a home run in front of 50,000 people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To be sure, baseball still seeped into conversation during the first two days of his trip. Orlando Hern\xc3\xa1ndez and Byung-Hyun Kim were the two pitchers he never figured out. He thought the increasing reliance on \xe2\x80\x9cMoneyball\xe2\x80\x9d principles had precipitated his retirement. He called being booed at Yankee Stadium \xe2\x80\x9cthe coolest thing I remember from my career.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But it is soccer, calcio, that consumes him now. \xe2\x80\x9cI like the adventure of this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the Reggiana project. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll hop on a train. I\xe2\x80\x99ll hop on a plane. I\xe2\x80\x99ll get in the car. I\xe2\x80\x99ll just go. I like the energy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He sipped Lambrusco, a sparkling red wine produced in the region. \xe2\x80\x9cI could fail,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI could end up losing some money here. But it was important to me to step outside of my comfort zone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Top-level college football players at private universities are employees entitled to request improved working conditions and even to seek pay for their efforts, according to a memorandum issued by the general counsel for the 'b'National Labor Relations Board'b' and made public on Tuesday.'b'The determination, which was included in a letter from the counsel, Robert F. Griffin, and addressed to regional board directors nationwide, found that scholarship football players at private colleges like Northwestern, Stanford and Notre Dame have employment rights and are protected by law should they seek to bargain for a safer work environment, or request pay.'b'The memo was revealed more than a year and a half after the N.L.R.B. in Washington 'b'declined to exert jurisdiction'b' over the Northwestern football team\xe2\x80\x99s union petition, which effectively denied players the right to unionize and collectively bargain. Griffin\xe2\x80\x99s memo does not affect that ruling. It does not give players at private universities the right to collectively bargain, nor does it carry the force of law like a full board finding, muting its impact. Supporters of athletes\xe2\x80\x99 rights called it a clear signal that the question of whether college football players are employees remains unsettled.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an important legal victory for college athletes,\xe2\x80\x9d said John Adam, a lawyer who represented the Northwestern players. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are employees and have the rights and protections of federal law. That\xe2\x80\x99s never happened.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last fall, Northwestern faced 'b' an unfair labor practice charge'b' after a California lawyer contended the football team\xe2\x80\x99s rule book encroached on players\xe2\x80\x99 rights. Northwestern resolved the dispute by removing restrictions on players\xe2\x80\x99 use of social media and their statements to the news media. One potential outcome of Tuesday\xe2\x80\x99s memo, Adam said, was that other private schools would be vulnerable to similar charges and might have to amend their team rules.'b'Donald Remy, the N.C.A.A.\xe2\x80\x99s chief legal officer, said: \xe2\x80\x9cThe general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s memo and personal opinion do not reflect a binding position of the N.L.R.B. As we have stated before and he was obligated to acknowledge, the N.L.R.B. previously decided that it would not exercise jurisdiction regarding the employment context of student-athletes and their schools. The general counsel\xe2\x80\x99s memo does not change that decision and does not allow student-athletes to unionize.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Any legal machinations, however, could soon be moot. The term of Griffin, who was appointed by President Barack Obama, ends in November, and President Trump will appoint the N.L.R.B.\xe2\x80\x99s next general counsel. The five-member board will also flip from a Democratic majority to Republican under the new administration, and the remade body is expected to be less sympathetic to organized labor.'b'Wilma B. Liebman, a former chairwoman of the N.L.R.B., said a new board could seek to clarify the employment status of college football players through a ruling on 'b'a case involving graduate teaching assistants'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA new board has the potential to look at this issue very differently,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that would limit any long-term implications.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A new standard has been set, as 'b'Tom Brady'b' of the 'b'New England Patriots'b' became the first quarterback in N.F.L. history to win five Super Bowls, leading his team to a 34-28 overtime victory over the Atlanta Falcons in 'b'Super Bowl'b' LI.'b'It looked like a blowout in Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s favor, with the Falcons racing to a 28-3 lead, but Brady, who had endured a great deal of pressure for much of the game, held tight and reeled off 25 consecutive points before the overtime period, getting a great deal of help from a circus catch by Julian Edelman that will help erase the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 painful memory of being sunk by David Tyree\xe2\x80\x99s helmet catch in Super Bowl XLII.'b'After forcing the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots got the ball first and, as they have done so many times in Brady\xe2\x80\x99s career, marched down the field, going 75 yards on eight plays, winning on James White\xe2\x80\x99s 2-yard touchdown run.'b''b''b''b'Super Bowl LI Box Score'b''b''b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe all brought each other back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Brady, who was named Super Bowl M.V.P. for a record fourth time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe never felt out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Danny Amendola, who caught the 2-point conversion that tied the score in regulation, did not hesitate to say that the win was Brady\xe2\x80\x99s crowning achievement.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was the same as he always is: cool, calm and collected,\xe2\x80\x9d Amendola said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s the leader, the general, the best ever and that is the end of the story.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Having grown up as a fan of the San Francisco 49ers, Brady claims to have never considered the possibility of joining his idol, Joe Montana, in having won four Super Bowls, let alone passing Montana and Terry Bradshaw, the Pittsburgh Hall of Famer, who each had four wins in four attempts.'b'And while Brady\xe2\x80\x99s journey was not quite as flawless, with two losses to go with his five wins, he now stands out as the most decorated quarterback of the Super Bowl era, and is tied with Charles Haley, the relentless defensive end for the Dallas Cowboys and the 49ers, for the most Super Bowl wins as a player. Brady also tied Bart Starr of the Green Bay Packers for the most N.F.L. championships by a quarterback, with Starr earning three titles before winning the first two Super Bowls.'b'Following the game, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell presented the Patriots with the Vince Lombardi Trophy. He was met with an extended chorus of boos thanks to his unpopular decision, among Patriots fans, to punish the team for the Deflategate scandal by suspending Brady for the first four games of this season. The Patriots went 3-1 with Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett filling in for Brady.'b'After Goodell handed the trophy to Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the Patriots, the boos turned into loud cheers. Kraft played to the crowd, making a thinly veiled reference to the punishment and calling it the sweetest win of his career.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot has transpired over the last two years,\xe2\x80\x9d Kraft said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think that needs a lot of explanation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Brady completed 43 of 62 passes for 466 yards and two touchdowns despite enduring five sacks and the first postseason pick-six of his career. He got plenty of help from White, the team\xe2\x80\x99s pass-catching running back, who had 14 catches for 110 yards and onereceiving touchdown, along with his game-winning run.'b'The Falcons, led by Matt Ryan, had looked nearly unstoppable for three quarters, scoring at will and holding New England in check with a defense that had steadily improved all season. But they seemingly ran out of steam on both ends of the ball, with the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 experience winning the day.'b'Even in defeat, there were plenty of positives for the Falcons, with Grady Jarrett tying a Super Bowl record with three sacks, Robert Alford returning an interception 82 yards for a touchdown, and Ryan completing 17 of 23 passes for 284 yards and two touchdowns. But after Ryan found Tevin Coleman for a 6-yard touchdown pass early in the third quarter, everything fell apart. From that point forward, Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s drives ended punt-fumble-punt-punt, while New England repeatedly chipped away at the lead.'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s how the Patriots completed the comeback and won their fifth title:'b'The Falcons, given a chance to win the game, managed just 16 yards on 3 plays and were forced to punt the ball away. With just 4 seconds to work with, the Patriots attempted a fake kneel and ran the ball, but it did not go nearly far enough and the Super Bowl is headed to overtime for the first time in the game\xe2\x80\x99s history.'b'At the end of an incredible 91-yard drive, that included a circus catch by Julian Edelman, James White ran for a 1-yard touchdown, and Tom Brady found Danny Amendola for a successful 2-point conversion, tying the game at 28-28 with under a minute remaining in the game.'b'Matt Ryan will now get a chance to lead a game-winning drive, or play for overtime.'b'The Patriots have the ball back with a chance to tie the Falcons.'b'Devonta Freeman showed off how dangerous he can be in the open field, Julio Jones reminded everyone that he just may be the best wide receiver in the game, but thanks to a devastating sack by Trey Flowers, and a holding call on Tom Compton, the Falcons were not even able to get a field goal.'b'Matt Ryan started the drive at his own 10-yard line and immediately found Devonta Freeman for a 39-yard catch-and-run that looked like it could go all the way with just a tad more luck. After a short run by Freeman, Ryan then escaped pressure and found Julio Jones for a seemingly impossible 27-yard reception on the sideline in which the star wide receiver reached over a defensive back to get the ball and then managed to plant his feet before falling out of bounds.'b'With 3:30 remaining, Brady has the ball and is down by 8 points.'b'We have a ballgame.'b'Tom Brady was never going to just roll over and let the Falcons win, and he found Danny Amendola for a 6-yard touchdown pass that along with a 2-point conversion has narrowed Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 28-20.'b'The drive when set up when the Falcons, who had not turned the ball over all game, decided to look for a deep pass on 3rd-and-1. Before Matt Ryan could release the ball he was hit by Don\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x99a Hightower, who swatted the ball to the ground. Alan Branch was able to recover the ball, giving New England just a 25-yard field to work with.'b'Brady needed just five plays, enduring one sack from Dwight Freeney along the way, and now trails by just 8 points with just under six minutes remaining in the game.'b'Atlanta may be short-handed the rest of the way as Tevin Coleman, one of Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s two star running backs, was forced from the game with an injury to his left ankle on the Falcons\xe2\x80\x99 previous drive. He was helped off the field and his status for the rest of the game has yet to be announced.'b'Grady Jarrett, the Atlanta defensive tackle, almost single-handedly turned what looked like a sure-thing touchdown drive into a field goal for the Patriots. A pair of sacks in the red zone forced the Patriots to abandon what had been a 12-play, 72-yard drive, with Stephen Gostkowski hitting from 33 yards to narrow the Atlanta lead to 28-12. With the game in the fourth quarter, it is now nearing the point of desperation for New England.'b'Brady steadily moved the ball down the field, with a huge 25-yard completion to Martellus Bennett having put the Patriots inside Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s 10-yard line. But then Jarrett, who had a sack in the first half of the game as well, just tore through the offensive line twice to put Brady on his back. The interior pressure from Jarrett, who has equaled his single-season sack total, has been a major factor all game. Brady has been hit 14 times by various Atlanta defenders.'b'The Patriots had gotten the ball back with no further scoring by Atlanta even though a botched onside kick attempt resulted in the Falcons starting a drive from New England\xe2\x80\x99s 41-yard line. Atlanta ended up losing 10 yards on the drive before punting the ball away.'b'The sequence helped ease the pain for Gostkowski, who missed an extra point, failed to convert an onside kick, and was penalized for 5 yards for touching the ball too soon on the onside kick attempt.'b'The Patriots finally got the team\xe2\x80\x99s first touchdown of the game when Tom Brady found James White for a 5-yard score. But thanks to a missed extra point, New England only narrowed Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s lead to 28-9.'b'The Patriots nearly out-thought themselves earlier in the drive when they tried to mix things up on a third-and-3 by letting Julian Edelman attempt a pass. The attempt from the college quarterback who learned to play wide receiver in the N.F.L. nearly wobbled its way into the arms of a defender before falling to the ground.'b'New England was able to convert on fourth-and-3 with a 17-yard pass from Brady to Danny Amendola, and a third down conversion later in the drive came by way of Brady\xe2\x80\x99s legs, with the 39-year-old rumbling for a 15-yard gain.'b'LeGarrette Blount got the Patriots into the red zone with a 4-yard carry, and then the big running back got another 9 yards on a run outside the tackles. Faced with a 1st-and-goal from the 7-yard line, the Patriots ran once with Blount for 2 yards and then let Brady find White, his safety valve on offense, for the touchdown.'b'Matt Ryan almost seems to be toying with the Patriots at this point. The Falcons\xe2\x80\x99 quarterback threw his second touchdown pass, this one a 6-yarder to Tevin Coleman, and along with the extra point Atlanta now leads 28-3.'b'The drive started with a diving catch by Taylor Gabriel that went for 17 yards. A short run was followed by Matt Ryan again going to Gabriel who was wide open in the middle of the field for a 35-yard gain.'b'Ryan picked up another first down on a diving catch by Mohamed Sanu that got Atlanta back into the red zone, and after a pair of rushing attempts by Devonta Freeman, Gabriel drew a defensive pass interference penalty on an incomplete pass, which helped set up the scoring play.'b'Ryan is now 12 for 14 for 193 yards and 2 touchdowns, showing the world why he was an easy choice for M.V.P. this season.'b'Momentum can turn remarkably quickly in a football game, so after the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 defense forced a three-and-out to start the second half, and then Julian Edelman reeled off a 34-yard punt return, New England suddenly seemed to have new life.'b'A challenge by Atlanta, that proved Edelman had stepped out of bounds, brought the ball back seven yards, and Tom Brady\xe2\x80\x99s first pass attempt of the half, while catchable, sailed over Chris Hogan\xe2\x80\x99s head. A pass to Danny Amendola went for a loss of two yards, forcing a third-and-12. Brady then tried to force the ball to Edelman but his go-to wide receiver could not handle the ball, and New England\xe2\x80\x99s offense once again was forced to punt.'b'Anyone expecting a loud political statement was disappointed, but Lady Gaga did at the very least succeed in performing a Super Bowl halftime show all by herself, rather than with an endless parade of guest stars.'b'The show started with a medley of patriotic songs sung from atop the roof of NRG Stadium, and after diving into the stadium \xe2\x80\x94 with the help of an elaborate harness \xe2\x80\x94 Lady Gaga transitioned into the familiar hits of her career. Joined only by dancers and pyrotechnics, she let the somewhat politically-charged lyrics of her songs, including \xe2\x80\x9cBorn This Way,\xe2\x80\x9d do the talking for her rather than making any overt political statement about President Trump or any other divisive issues.'b'While much of the show was a big spectacle, the highlight likely came when she quieted the crowd for a stripped-down version of her recent single, \xe2\x80\x9cMillion Reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d with the stadium lit up by the flashlights on the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s phones.'b'She ended the show with a mike drop and a dive into an unseen abyss.'b'There were plenty of pundits predicting a Falcons victory, but few could have seen a blowout in Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s favor on the horizon. That is just what happened in the first half, as the Falcons raced to a 21-3 lead in a game that seemed even more lopsided than that.'b'That the Patriots even scored was somewhat surprising after some tremendous work by the upstart Atlanta defense that produced a pair of turnovers, both by Robert Alford who has to be the early favorite to be named the game\xe2\x80\x99s Most Valuable Player should the score hold up.'b'On New England\xe2\x80\x99s final drive of the half, Tom Brady salvaged some respect with a series of completions. No further room could be found, but the team was close enough that Stephen Gostkowski was able to put the Patriots on the board with a 41-yard field goal.'b'Brady did not seem like himself for much of the half, missing badly on several passing attempts, likely as a result of constant pressure from Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s defensive line. In one sequence late in the half, he found Martellus Bennett for a 15-yard completion but paid for it with the type of truly jarring hit that New England\xe2\x80\x99s offensive line is nearly always able to protect him from.'b'With Atlanta set to receive the ball to start the second half, New England needs to find answers on both sides of the ball. The Falcons are winning the turnover battle, moving the ball easily on offense following a sluggish start, and seem to have no problem penetrating the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 offensive line.'b'Repeatedly given extra chances to succeed on a drive that seemed doomed, the Patriots looked like they would at least get a field goal prior to halftime, but Robert Alford had other ideas, stepping in front of Tom Brady\xe2\x80\x99s pass for an interception and running it back 82 yards for a touchdown. Along with the extra point, Atlanta now has a commanding 21-0 lead with less than three minutes left in the first half.'b'It was the first postseason pick-six of Brady\xe2\x80\x99s career, and was Alford\xe2\x80\x99s second turnover of the game.'b'That the defense came through for Atlanta once again was fairly surprising as the unit\xe2\x80\x99s youthful exuberance had reared its head earlier in the drive. Three times they appeared to have ended the drive by not allowing Brady to convert on third down only to have the drive extended each time thanks to defensive holding penalties.'b'But thanks to Alford, none of those mistakes matter.'b'With the Patriots clearly reeling, the Falcons are continuing to push hard on both sides of the ball, and Matt Ryan found Austin Hooper in the left side of the end zone for a diving 19-yard touchdown catch. After a botched attempt at an extra point was brought back thanks to a penalty, the Falcons made the second attempt and now lead 14-0.'b'Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s defense delivered the ball back to its offense with yet another three-and-out and the offense wasted no time, going 62 yards on 5 plays with less than two minutes running off the clock.'b'Matt Ryan started the drive with a 24-yard completion to Taylor Gabriel and then an 18-yard completion to Julio Jones. A 1-yard run by Tevin Coleman got the ball back into the red zone, and after Ryan\xe2\x80\x99s first attempt to Hooper fell incomplete thanks to great coverage by Patrick Chung, Ryan threw to his tight end on the other side of the field for the score.'b'The Falcons now have a 189 to 111 advantage in total yards.'b'The Atlanta defense continues to prove that its strong play in the playoffs was no fluke, and the team\xe2\x80\x99s sensational offense finally showed up. That combination added up to a 7-0 lead for the underdogs.'b'The second quarter opened with Tom Brady finding Julian Edelman for a 27-yard gain and New England looked to keep the Falcons on their heels by running right at them with LeGarrette Blount. But the big running back managed four yards before Deion Jones punched the ball out for a fumble and Robert Alford was able to recover it, handing the ball back to Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s offense.'b'Not content to go out meekly on a third consecutive drive, Matt Ryan steadily moved his team down the field with two consecutive completions to Julio Jones that covered 42 yards, followed by a 15-yard run by Devonta Freeman. Inside the red zone for the first time, Atlanta again ran with Freeman, and then from the 5-yard line Ryan handed the ball to Freeman who faked right, cut left and easily ran into the end zone for the first score of the game.'b'The scoring drive covered 71 yards on 5 plays.'b'Beyond a thrilling 37-yard run by Devonta Freeman of the Falcons, and some excellent work by the defensive lines for both teams, the first quarter was fairly uneventful, with both teams resorting to punts on each possession.'b'The Patriots had one promising drive, that included Tom Brady finding Danny Amendola, Chris Hogan, Malcolm Mitchell and James White for completions in a steady march down the field. But a play-action fake did not fool Courtney Upshaw, a mammoth defensive tackle, at all as he ran right through the fake and sacked Brady for an 8-yard loss.'b'Brady\xe2\x80\x99s next pass was an attempt to White which fell incomplete thanks to tight coverage and then another defensive tackle, Grady Jarrett, chased Brady down from behind for Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s second sack of the game, short-circuiting what had looked like a promising drive as New England once again was forced to punt.'b'Pressure has been cited as one of the keys to the game for Atlanta, and thus far their defensive line is definitely making its presence known. But their defense is not typically the team\xe2\x80\x99s strength, so the Falcons\xe2\x80\x99 offense will need to wake up to keep the team in this game.'b'After a coin flip by President George H.W. Bush (tails), Super Bowl LI between the New England Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons kicked off at 6:37 p.m. Eastern at NRG Stadium in Houston. After winning the toss, the Falcons deferred, giving the Patriots the ball to start the game.'b'After a week dominated by 'b'political discussions'b', Tom Brady\xe2\x80\x99s chances of winning a fifth Super Bowl, and curiosity of what 'b'Lady Gaga\xe2\x80\x99s halftime performance could entail'b', the talk on Sunday turned decidedly to football. President Trump predicted an 8-point victory for his good friend Tom Brady, but the biggest issue seemed to be the uncertain status of Alex Mack, the Falcons\xe2\x80\x99 star center, who will reportedly be playing with a fractured fibula.'b'Overcoming a significant injury to play in the Super Bowl is hardly a new phenomenon, with Terrell Owens having played a starring role for the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl XXXIX despite having fractured the same bone as Mack. But no one knows how effective Mack can be, or how long he will be able to stay on the field. Any disruption in line play could dramatically alter Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s high-flying offense, as Mack is not only great at managing handoffs but was rated as the top run-blocking center in the game by Pro Football Focus.'b'Despite a wide gap of experience between the two teams, both sides remained calm and composed all week. Atlanta Coach Dan Quinn emphasized a team-first business-like approach to the Falcons that was honed in his time in Seattle, and Patriots Coach Bill Belichick continued to run the league\xe2\x80\x99s tightest ship.'b'At least six members of the 'b'Super Bowl'b'-winning 'b'New England Patriots'b' have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president.'b'Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \xe2\x80\x9cplanned on skipping\xe2\x80\x9d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip.'b'Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports 'b'in a radio interview'b' on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rich Eisen Show\xe2\x80\x9d later in the afternoon. \xe2\x80\x9cI just don\xe2\x80\x99t feel welcome in that house,\xe2\x80\x9d Blount said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to just leave it at that.\xe2\x80\x9d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to 'b'spend time with family.'b''b'A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\xe2\x80\x99a Hightower bowed out when he 'b'told ESPN'b', \xe2\x80\x9cBeen there, done that,\xe2\x80\x9d having visited with a championship Alabama team.'b'Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl 'b'that he would not go'b': \xe2\x80\x9cIt is what it is,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter.\xe2\x80\x9d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he 'b'might move to outer space'b' after 'b'Donald J.

With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country.'b'The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said'b'.'b'No date has been scheduled for this year\xe2\x80\x99s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\xe2\x80\x99s champions, the Broncos, took place in June.'b'Perhaps no other team has as 'b'close an association'b' with Trump as the Patriots.'b'Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again\xe2\x80\x9d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and 'b'several news media accounts'b' confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\xe2\x80\x99s owner, Robert K. Kraft, 'b'has said 'b'he has considered Trump a longtime friend.'b'Brady did not attend his team\xe2\x80\x99s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason.'b'Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, 'b'saying in a statement'b': \xe2\x80\x9cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited 'b'his opposition to abortion'b' as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit.'b'A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments.'b'Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there 'b'solidified under Ronald Reagan'b'. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity.'b'Six Patriots, so far, won\xe2\x80\x99t make the trip this year.'b'HOUSTON \xe2\x80\x94 The 'b'N.F.L.'b' seems to have built a virtual wall around the 'b'New England Patriots'b' when it comes to public discussion of two lightning-rod topics for the team: President Trump ('b'a friend of the team\xe2\x80\x99s owner, coach and star quarterback'b') and 'b'Roger Goodell'b', the league\xe2\x80\x99s commissioner, who punished the team after a cheating investigation.'b'At a prime-time event on Monday called Opening Night, in which reporters received access to the participants in Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Super Bowl'b', hundreds of reporters peppered members of the teams with all manner of questions, including what they thought of Trump and Goodell.'b'But when the N.F.L. posted transcripts of the interviews with members of the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons, there were almost no references to Trump or Goodell.'b'Reporters were certainly curious, given the nation\xe2\x80\x99s political climate and the controversy over the suspension of the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 quarterback, 'b'Tom Brady'b', for four games as a result of the \xe2\x80\x9cDeflategate\xe2\x80\x9d scandal, in which the league said he conspired to manipulate footballs to his advantage in a conference championship game two years ago.'b'Brady, Coach 'b'Bill Belichick'b' and the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 owner, Robert K. Kraft, also happen to be friends of the president, whose actions, including his temporary ban on refugees and restrictions on immigrants from some Muslim-majority countries, have been highly controversial.'b'Of the transcripts provided for the interviews with 26 of the Patriots players and coaches and 28 of the Falcons players and coaches, the name \xe2\x80\x9cTrump\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear in any of them, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cpresident\xe2\x80\x9d appears only in reference to team presidents, despite reporters\xe2\x80\x99 having asked about them. The name \xe2\x80\x9cGoodell\xe2\x80\x9d appears just once.'b'The league had little to fear. As he often does when confronted with hot-button issues, Belichick said that he wanted to talk only about football. Brady was asked about Trump three times and Goodell four times, and he sidestepped each question.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not talking politics at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Brady said after being asked about his relationship with the president. When asked why, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI just want to focus on the positive aspects of this game and my teammates and the reasons why we\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Brady was also asked about the possibility of receiving the Vince Lombardi Trophy from Goodell if the Patriots were to win the Super Bowl on Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not worried about the postgame or anything like that, I just want to go out there and do great during the game.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Belichick, who is often gruff with reporters, batted away questions about the president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m focused on our team and for getting ready for Sunday,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, lips clenched.'b'A spokesman for the N.F.L., Brian McCarthy, said the transcripts of the one-hour media sessions, which are typically compiled by public-relations staff from the teams involved, were not intended to be a complete account of the interviews. Rather, the league tries to provide the highlights as quickly as possible to the 2,000 or so members of the media credentialed for the Super Bowl.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no editing of these quotes by the person who is transcribing nor by the league office,\xe2\x80\x9d McCarthy said.'b'The league has sanitized its Super Bowl transcripts in past years, too. Two years ago, for instance, the league\xe2\x80\x99s transcript of interviews with 'b'the Seattle Seahawks\xe2\x80\x99 outspoken cornerback'b', Richard Sherman, did not include his answers to questions about Kraft or about Goodell and his handling of the domestic violence case involving the Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice.'b'The fact that the N.F.L. does not even acknowledge these questions and their anodyne answers underscores the lengths it will go not to offend its fans.'b'Its striving for a neutral stance on thorny political questions is in contrast to the National Basketball Association, which in recent years has willingly taken stances against perceived attacks on L.G.B.T. rights and Trump\xe2\x80\x99s temporary ban on refugees, among others.'b'Prominent N.B.A. stars including LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony have also shared their opinions on topics of the day.'b'Football players, of course, have plenty of opinions. But in the media swirl of the Super Bowl, only a handful of players will venture to share them, and many of them are shared only when a reporter happens to include them in an article. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the league only transcribes interviews with the 10 players or coaches that each team places at designated podiums and a handful of players who mill around.'b'Martellus Bennett, the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 loquacious and talented tight end, had perhaps the most pointed response of the evening when asked whether he would visit the White House if the Patriots won the Super Bowl.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely not,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a reporter from The Detroit Free Press. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I don\xe2\x80\x99t support the person in it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Falcons wide receiver Mohamed Sanu, a Muslim, also did not duck questions about the travel ban, something the N.F.L. did include in its transcripts.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very tough situation and I just pray that us as a country and a world can be united as one,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really hard for me to talk about this right now. It would take a lot of time so I just want to focus on the game and focus on football.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The abiding culture in the N.F.L., and in football more broadly, dictates that players look inward to the team and do as little as possible to stand out off the field. That is one reason the public reaction was so heated when Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback, chose not to stand for the national anthem to highlight the issue of police brutality.'b'Kaepernick and the handful of players who acted in sympathy with him, though, are rare. Falcons outside linebacker De\xe2\x80\x99Vondre Campbell summed up that more prevalent position when asked by a reporter on Monday about how he remained focused \xe2\x80\x9cwith everything going on in our society today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust really stay out of the social media world because you kind of get sucked into it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, according to a transcript provided by the N.F.L. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can kind of start believing in some of the stuff you see.

She has embraced a persona as an outcast of sorts by labeling herself as Mother Monster and her fans as Little Monsters. But after criticizing Mr. Trump before the election, she has remained mostly quiet about him on social media since. On Twitter, where she speaks to an audience of more than 65 million people, she has shown support for the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March on Washington and various other causes, but has not posted about Mr. Trump directly since Nov. 13.'b'Considering her politically active nature and her vocal support of Hillary Clinton, Lady Gaga\xe2\x80\x99s selection to perform at the halftime show was a somewhat atypical choice for the controversy-averse N.F.L. Shortly after her selection, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Entertainment Tonight,\xe2\x80\x9d citing unnamed sources, claimed she would be prohibited from mentioning Mr. Trump during the performance'b', but in a statement at the time a representative for the league called that \xe2\x80\x9cnonsense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The history of the halftime show has been largely without controversy, progressing from marching bands to upbeat groups like Up With People and then safe pop acts like New Kids on the Block. The league was forced to try to mix things up when in 1992 the sketch show \xe2\x80\x9cIn Living Color\xe2\x80\x9d staged an alternative halftime show on Fox that drew more than 20 million viewers and an estimated 10 rating points away from the official performance by Gloria Estefan at the game. The show\xe2\x80\x99s football-themed comedy appealed to younger viewers more than Ms. Estefan\xe2\x80\x99s performance, in which she was joined by the figure skaters Brian Boitano and Dorothy Hamill.'b'By 1993, the league had learned its lesson, and had Michael Jackson perform, and in the years that followed they had a string of other top performers including U2, Paul McCartney and Prince.'b'While recent years have seen the league try to go for younger, possibly more relevant performers, the controversies have been few and far between. When the Red Hot Chili Peppers admitted to not having played their instruments live it qualified as a notable event.'b'The one exception to the rule, of course, came in the halftime performance for Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, when Justin Timberlake infamously tore away part of Janet Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s top, thus creating a new meaning for the term \xe2\x80\x9cwardrobe malfunction.\xe2\x80\x9d It just so happens that the one controversial event happened at Reliant Stadium, which was renamed NRG Stadium in 2014 and will be the setting of Lady Gaga\xe2\x80\x99s performance on Sunday.'b'Lady Gaga insisted there would be no repeat of Ms. Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s wardrobe malfunction, saying that everything would be \xe2\x80\x9cnice and tight,\xe2\x80\x9d but said she wanted to preserve the mystery of her performance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere will be no meat dress there, so don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for that,\xe2\x80\x9d Lady Gaga said. \xe2\x80\x9cGet excited to see something that you haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have a situation,\xe2\x80\x9d the lieutenant began.'b'His call interrupted my second nightcap.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m listening,\xe2\x80\x9d I said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA football jersey has gone missing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I swallowed and let out a low whistle.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe owner is one 'b'Tom Brady'b',\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA.k.a. husband of Gisele B\xc3\xbcndchen, 'b'New England Patriots'b' quarterback and most valuable player of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Super Bowl'b'.

A couple of Patriots flunkies were hanging around, but they were too emotional to talk. So I chatted up a security guard who had some video.'b'Watching it over and over, rewinding, fast-forwarding, I knew in my gut that something had gone down. Something \xe2\x80\xa6 un-American.'b''b'10:05:'b' The victim, wearing a Super Bowl championship T-shirt, is driven by golf cart to the locker room.

The media, I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing.'b''b'10:20:'b' Now the victim, visibly upset, is searching a carry-on bag, his locker, the floor around him. He asks someone to see if the equipment guys have found his game jersey yet.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI put it right here,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI know exactly where I put it. Crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not crazy; this was evil. And I knew from hard experience that the longer the jersey was missing, the more likely it would wind up in the private collection of some memorabilia sicko, never to be seen again by a worshiping public. The coffee churned in my stomach.'b'I drove home and tried to sleep. I muttered a prayer to St. Anthony, patron saint of lost items. I turned out the light. Then everything went dark.'b'The good saint never answered. Instead, I woke up to the news that the lieutenant governor of Texas \xe2\x80\x94 the lieutenant governor \xe2\x80\x94 had announced that the Texas Rangers \xe2\x80\x94 the Texas Rangers \xe2\x80\x94 were joining the hunt.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn Texas, we place a very high value on hospitality and football,\xe2\x80\x9d the lieutenant governor said. \xe2\x80\x9cTom Brady\xe2\x80\x99s jersey has great historical value and is already being called the most valuable N.F.L. collectible ever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is important that history does not record that it was stolen in Texas.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As if I needed the extra pressure. 'b'We\xe2\x80\x99re not talking here about Jim Bowie\xe2\x80\x99s knife,'b' I thought.'b' This is a 'b''b'sweaty 'b''b'shirt owned by a guy who can afford to buy another one!'b''b'I was losing it again.

And began searching through a sample book of cloth swatches for an idea, a clue \xe2\x80\xa6 anything.'b'The phone rang a long time before I picked up. I knew who it was. With nothing to report, I quoted the Sherlockian theorem that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d the lieutenant said, his voice mocking, \xe2\x80\x9cyou believe that, however improbable, this football jersey just climbed out of that duffle bag?

I\xe2\x80\x99ve got crazies blaming Syrian refugees! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the Vatican calling to say this jersey might have spiritual significance!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He caught his breath and lowered his voice.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis goes all the way to the very top, Detective. Do you understand? The victim has \xe2\x80\xa6 connections. And now I\xe2\x80\x99ve got the White House offering the services of some black-ops agency so secret it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even have an acronym. It\xe2\x80\x99s referred to only with a series of coded grunts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His voice rose again. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, Detective, what does all this mean?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt means it\xe2\x80\x99s getting awfully crowded up in my boxers! So FIND THAT JERSEY!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Click.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYessir,\xe2\x80\x9d I said to dead air.'b'I started to write down the names of anyone who might want to wish the victim ill. Seven hours later, my half-finished list included the Atlanta Falcons; the N.F.L. commissioner; some lawyer named Ted Wells; and most of the 300 million Americans who live outside New England.'b'I slammed down my pen. I wanted a drink, bad. I wanted to be with Vera, lovely Vera, making her laugh as she worked the counter down at the Bowl-O-Rama. But you can never go back.'b'Desperate, I decided to retrace my steps, beginning with another hard look at that locker-room video. This time, I noticed that at the very end, the victim\xe2\x80\x99s voice can be heard cracking slightly as he asks:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGuys? Did anyone see it?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I started to choke up, so I hit pause. Staring at the frozen crime scene through a blur of tears, I cursed the twisted, thieving S.O.B. who had besmirched this day: the holiest day on the American calendar.'b'I vowed then and there to bring the fiend to justice. And to track down this precious piece of polyester knit.'b'He looked down at the table, then at the wall, then at the ceiling, and then back at the table. Reaching for his glass of water, his hand quivered like disturbed Jell-O.'b'I had to ask.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs everything all right, Commissioner?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'LEVELLAND, Tex. \xe2\x80\x94 Steve Green, the men\xe2\x80\x99s basketball coach at South Plains College, was recovering from an up-and-down season last summer when he decided he needed to make a change. So he planted himself in front of the television in his living room and began to study \xe2\x80\x94 really study \xe2\x80\x94 his favorite team.'b'Green scribbled down every cut, every back screen and every curl. In pursuit of a goal that was so ambitious that it bordered on audacious, he consulted with his assistants and overhauled his playbook. His wife, Teresa, discovered that she needed to make room for a new love in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s life.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe is obsessed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the Warriors.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his grand experiment to turn his team into the junior college version of the Golden State Warriors \xe2\x80\x94 yes, 'b'those'b' Warriors \xe2\x80\x94 Green has coached the South Plains Texans to a 28-0 record as they enter the postseason.'b'South Plains, the top-ranked junior college team in the country, averages 98.4 points a game, shooting 52.2 percent from the field. They spread the floor, move the ball and shoot jumpers from Siberia, averaging 11.7 3-pointers a game.'b'If that all sounds familiar, it should: The Texans run the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 plays.'b'Green, 63, has never met Steve Kerr, the coach of the Warriors, nor has he had the chance to watch the N.B.A.\xe2\x80\x99s highest-octane team play in person. But the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 growing influence is apparent here in Levelland, a small city of 14,000 set amid cotton fields and oil rigs about 30 miles west of Lubbock.'b'South Plains plays its home games at the Texan Dome, a 3,300-seat arena that features championship rodeo banners and sometimes leaks in rainy weather. But before his team fires off one 3-pointer after another and dunks opponents to smithereens, Green meets with his assistants in a windowless conference room where, among more prosaic items of business, they watch the Warriors, discuss the Warriors and plagiarize the Warriors.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to put this new one in today,\xe2\x80\x9d Green said on a recent morning as he fiddled with a short video clip on his iPhone. \xe2\x80\x9cThey ran this against Memphis the other night, and I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen them do this before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the fourth quarter of a victory against the Grizzlies last month, the Warriors unveiled a play that excited Green. Shaun Livingston, the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 backup point guard, threw a pass to James Michael McAdoo at the right elbow. Over at the left elbow, Kevin Durant set a screen for Klay Thompson, who then took a handoff from McAdoo. As two defenders converged on him, Thompson slipped a bounce pass to a cutting McAdoo for a dunk.'b'The basket put the Warriors up by 24. In other words, the sequence was both forgettable and inconsequential \xe2\x80\x94 to everyone, perhaps, except Green, and only because he watches every second of every Warriors game.'b'Green has no idea what the Warriors actually call their plays \xe2\x80\x94 they keep them secret \xe2\x80\x94 so he just makes up his own names as he goes. The one involving McAdoo and Thompson would, in South Plains-ese, be \xe2\x80\x9cHorns 52.\xe2\x80\x9d Green described his creative process.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll put something new in, and the guys will be like, \xe2\x80\x98What are you going to call it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99ll say: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. What do you guys want to call it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It should be noted that not everything South Plains does comes straight from the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 playbook. The Texans run weaves in transition, and Green is fond of some principles of the motion offense.'b'Most of the time, though, he is channeling Golden State. That means fewer pick-and-rolls in favor of greater movement away from the ball, including flare screens and back screens designed to spring shooters free from defenders. The ball zips from teammate to teammate.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor a long time in the N.B.A., people got away from the five-man game,\xe2\x80\x9d Kerr said in a telephone interview on Wednesday as he discussed the impact his team was having on college programs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was more of an isolation game. But people are going smaller and faster. And for us, I think the key is that we don\xe2\x80\x99t hold the ball. We almost always have five playmakers on the floor. The ball moves, and nobody dominates it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In terms of getting his team to function like the Warriors, Green has found that it helps to have good players. (Kerr concurred.) Jordan Brangers, the starting shooting guard at South Plains, averages 21.8 points a game and shoots 48.7 percent from the 3-point line. In a lopsided victory last month, Brangers, who is 6 feet 2 inches, shot 14 of 19 from the field and sank 10 of 15 3-pointers.'b'His coach sees shades of the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 Stephen Curry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kid does not miss an open shot,\xe2\x80\x9d Green said.'b'Like many of his teammates, 'b'Brangers traveled a long road to South Plains'b'. He was a standout high school player in Radcliff, Ky., before dropping out in his senior year because of what he described as personal and academic issues.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was done with organized basketball,\xe2\x80\x9d Brangers said.'b'After a coach persuaded him to earn his G.E.D., he briefly attended two small colleges without playing a single minute of basketball, he said. He returned home to Kentucky, filling his days with pickup hoops.'b'Then, one afternoon, Green showed up. He had heard about Brangers from a friend. Green watched him shoot for about two minutes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you kidding me?\xe2\x80\x9d Green recalled saying.'b'At South Plains, Brangers has thrived. Green often sends him late-night texts that include 10-second video bursts of Curry or Thompson performing various feats of basketball wizardry. Green is not known for his technical savvy. He records the clips off his television using his iPhone, then hits \xe2\x80\x9csend.\xe2\x80\x9d The clips can be fuzzy \xe2\x80\x94 more celluloid than high def \xe2\x80\x94 but he gets his point across: 'b'See how Thompson got open here?'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really just understanding how those guys come off screens,\xe2\x80\x9d Brangers said.'b'If Brangers operates as a Curry-Thompson hybrid, Steve Green has shaped 'b'Jahlil Tripp, his starting power forward'b', into a facsimile of the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 Draymond Green: a versatile player who can handle the ball, shoot with range and defend multiple positions. Tripp, a product of Lincoln High in Brooklyn, averages 11.4 points and 6.6 rebounds while playing just 17.3 minutes a game. The Texans spread the wealth: Ten players average at least 10 minutes a game.'b'He said he would prefer to be known as a college version of the Cavaliers\xe2\x80\x99 LeBron James, his favorite player.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut Coach wants me to be Draymond,\xe2\x80\x9d said Tripp, who has scholarship offers from schools like Hofstra, Indiana State and the University of the Pacific. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m Draymond.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And there is 'b'Josh Webster, the starting point guard'b', who tries to emulate Livingston, a lanky and efficient playmaker. Like Livingston, Webster is perpetually searching for driving lanes as teammates drag defenders to the 3-point line. Webster, who is bound for Texas Tech with Brangers next season, shoots 62.6 percent from the field, which goes to the core of Green\xe2\x80\x99s revamped approach.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI just want guys who can shoot now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have somebody on the floor who can\xe2\x80\x99t score, you\xe2\x80\x99re playing four against five. They just don\xe2\x80\x99t guard them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Green, in his 17th season at South Plains, is a decorated coach. He guided his team to national championships in 2008 and 2012, and it was the runner-up in 2015. But last season was a relative struggle. South Plains finished 21-9 and out of the playoff picture. Something was amiss.'b'Green had already been thinking about how the game was evolving. As a young coach, he said, he was schooled on the importance of defense. In fact, his first college job was as a graduate assistant to 'b'Eddie Sutton at Arkansas'b', back when the Razorbacks were a grind-it-out, roll-up-your-sleeves squad of sturdy defenders.'b'But in recent years, Green had seen how players were becoming more skilled on offense: power forwards who could put the ball on the floor and shoot 3-pointers, guards who could stretch defenders like rubber bands by pulling up from 25 feet. He had one such player, Marshall Henderson, who led South Plains to its national title in 2012.'b'Green recalled a conversation he had a few years ago with a colleague.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think we\xe2\x80\x99ve gotten to a point now where you can\xe2\x80\x99t really stop anybody anymore, but you just decide, hey, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to allow you to take this shot instead of that shot?\xe2\x80\x9d Green recalled asking him. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99ve all begun to realize \xe2\x80\x94 especially in the pros \xe2\x80\x94 that nobody can stop anybody one on one. I just think it\xe2\x80\x99s more about the offensive end now than it is about the defensive end.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At South Plains, Green wants his players to be strategic on defense: Suffocate opponents along the 3-point line and make life difficult for them in the paint. He is more than willing to cede midrange jumpers, the least efficient shot in basketball. The Texans have limited opponents to 28.3 percent shooting from 3-point range and outscored them by an average of 35.4 points a game.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re the best team in the country,\xe2\x80\x9d Brian Lohrey, the coach at New Mexico Junior College, said after watching South Plains drain 14 of 25 3-pointers in a 26-point win against his team last month. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of good teams at this level. We\xe2\x80\x99re good. But we are not good against them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In so many ways, the players at South Plains could not be more removed from the glamour of the N.B.A. They ride a bus to all their road games, a mode of transport that Tripp assessed as a \xe2\x80\x9creal experience.\xe2\x80\x9d They live in a no-frills dorm across the street from the Texan Dome. They amuse themselves with post-practice games of one on one.'b'But they adhere to what Kerr described as the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 mentality: a willingness to pass and create for others. At South Plains, miles from nowhere, they do it as well as anyone.'b'MELBOURNE, Australia \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Serena Williams'b' was utterly unaware that a victory on Saturday night would put her back at No. 1. Her coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, did all he could to keep her in the dark.'b'But there was no hiding the other statistical stakes as Williams walked back into Rod Laver Arena, headphones around her neck and game-face in place, to play her older sister 'b'Venus Williams'b' in the Australian Open final.'b'The tennis circuit can be an echo chamber where the same questions and themes reverberate from week to week as the locations change, but the protagonists do not.'b'So even if Serena Williams refused to entertain questions during the tournament about the possibility of winning her 23rd Grand Slam singles title and breaking her tie for the Open-era record with Steffi Graf, there was no dodging that number in her own head.'b'Now, after her 6-4, 6-4 victory over her sister, she can celebrate No. 23 instead of fret over it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been chasing it for a really long time,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen it got on my radar, I knew I had an opportunity to get there, and I\xe2\x80\x99m here. It\xe2\x80\x99s a great feeling. No better place to do it than Melbourne.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She and her sister made their first visit to Melbourne in 1998. They were teenagers with braces on their teeth and braids in their hair and a clear sense that they were special, but no idea of just how far their talents and confidence would carry them.'b'Much has changed in 19 years. Rod Laver Arena now has a wraparound digital screen at court level and electronic line calling. The court, once green, is now a deep blue. The beads and the braces are long gone, but the sisters\xe2\x80\x99 power tennis remains. And though their father, Richard Williams, in one of the great sports predictions, saw the future clearly when he said the younger, fiercer Serena would turn out to be the better player, perhaps not even he realized how wide the gap would eventually grow.'b'Serena Williams now has 23 major singles titles to her sister\xe2\x80\x99s seven, and has won seven of their nine Grand Slam finals and eight of their last nine matches.'b'Those figures brook no argument. Williams 2.0 has the better operating system when it comes to locating the lines and creating the angles under the greatest pressure. She also has the purer service motion.'b'But Williams 1.0 certainly gave it her all Saturday night, throwing herself into the groundstrokes and displaying more emotion when a return struck the net or a rally failed than she has perhaps ever shown in a major final.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was palpable how much Venus wanted it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Isha Price, the Williamses\xe2\x80\x99 half sister.'b'An all-Williams final is always an emotionally complex affair, which is all the more reason to admire how the older sister has so often handled the disappointments.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s my little sister, guys,\xe2\x80\x9d Venus Williams said, pointing at Serena during the post-match ceremony.'b'She then spoke to her sister directly. It was quite a riff.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCongratulations, Serena, on No. 23,\xe2\x80\x9d Williams said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have been there right with you. Some of them I lost right there against you. I guess that\xe2\x80\x99s weird, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been an awesome thing. Your win has always been my win. I think you know that. And all the time I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be there, didn\xe2\x80\x99t get there, you were there. I\xe2\x80\x99m enormously proud of you. You mean the world to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Serena Williams is now within one victory of Margaret Court\xe2\x80\x99s career record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood on her if she\xe2\x80\x99s good enough to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d Court said during the week in Melbourne.'b'Williams has closed in on Court with an unprecedented run of success at an age when most great women\xe2\x80\x99s tennis players of the past had already retired. Graf, for example, was done by 30. But Williams has now won 10 major singles title since turning 30. On Saturday, she became the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title in the Open era, breaking her own record set at Wimbledon last year. Venus, 36, was the oldest Australian Open finalist in the Open era.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way I would be at 23 without her; there\xe2\x80\x99s no way I would be at 1 without her,\xe2\x80\x9d Serena Williams said of her sister in the on-court ceremony. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no way I would have anything without her. She\xe2\x80\x99s my inspiration. She\xe2\x80\x99s the only reason I\xe2\x80\x99m standing here today, and the only reason that the Williams sisters exist. So thank you, Venus, for inspiring me to be the best player I could be and inspiring me to work hard. Every time you won this week, I felt like I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to win, too.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This final was edgy from the start, beginning with four straight breaks of serve and with Serena Williams angrily breaking a racket in just the third game after she lost her footing trying to change direction when one of her sister\xe2\x80\x99s shots struck the net cord.'b'The quality of play fluctuated considerably, but the match ultimately was determined by Serena Williams\xe2\x80\x99s returns. Venus Williams had won over 50 percent of the points on her second serve in her surprise run to the final. She won just 29 percent Saturday.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSerena always expects a tough match against her sister, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t think she expected it to be quite that tough from the start,\xe2\x80\x9d Mouratoglou said.'b'At 35, Williams is back on top after playing little in 2016 except for the Grand Slam events and losing the No. 1 ranking to Angelique Kerber, who defeated her in last year\xe2\x80\x99s Australian Open final.'b'Williams looked shocked when it was announced after her victory that she would return to No. 1. Mouratoglou later explained, a tad sheepishly, that he had not answered truthfully when Serena had inquired about it. He said he wanted to avoid putting extra pressure on her at an already fraught moment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cActually, I think she\xe2\x80\x99s happy I did it now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The Open could easily have gone awry for Serena Williams. In her return to the circuit earlier this month at a tournament in Auckland, New Zealand, she was upset in her second match by Madison Brengle, making 88 unforced errors on a blustery day.'b'But Williams has often proved that she can click into a higher gear without much match play, and she did not drop a set in seven matches as she won her seventh Australian Open singles title.'b'Venus Williams, seeded 13th here, remains one of the great players of this era, but she has not won a major singles title since she beat Serena to win Wimbledon in 2008. In the intervening years, she received a diagnosis of Sjogren\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome, an autoimmune disorder, that limited her training and contributed to her falling from the top 100 in 2011.'b'But she has learned to manage her health problems and is having a late-career renaissance that might be a much bigger talking point if it were not for her younger sister\xe2\x80\x99s late-career surge. Venus Williams will be at No. 11 in Monday\xe2\x80\x99s WTA rankings.'b'The sisters have become, through experience, adept at compartmentalizing, even if facing each other across the net is still not entirely natural.'b'Their family members struggle with it, too. Their parents, Richard Williams and Oracene Price, did not make the long journey to Melbourne this year, but Isha Price did. And she decided that she preferred to watch the match at her hotel until it was nearly over instead of putting herself through the crucible of watching in person.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLong story short, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think people actually understand the significance of what they see, these two players, who literally for generations have been able to transcend what they do,\xe2\x80\x9d Price said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s very difficult to watch, listen, hear commentary, all of that. We watch tennis on mute. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard. To keep your body in optimal shape to be able to perform at this level consistently over 20 years is an incredible feat. But you still have the conversation where it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is becoming increasingly difficult to quibble with the record books, however. Serena keeps moving the bar higher, but the poignant part on Saturday night, was that despite all of Venus\xe2\x80\x99s talent and staying power and eloquence, only one Williams sister has managed to win the singles championship at Melbourne Park.'b'President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ban on visitors from seven predominantly Muslim nations could have a wide impact on international sports, including jeopardizing a warm relationship between the United States and 'b'Iran'b' in wrestling competitions and threatening the chances of Los Angeles hosting the 2024 Summer Olympics and of the United States securing soccer\xe2\x80\x99s 2026 World Cup.'b'On Saturday, sports officials struggled to understand the implications of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order, including the question of whether athletes from the targeted nations could enter the United States to compete, especially in the initial 90-day period of the ban.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are working closely with the administration to understand the new rules and how we best navigate them as it pertains to visiting athletes,\xe2\x80\x9d Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the United States Olympic Committee, said in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know they are supportive of the Olympic movement and our bid and believe we will have a good working relationship with them to ensure our success in hosting and attending events.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At least one International Olympic Committee delegate criticized Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision. The delegate, Richard Peterkin of St. Lucia, said Saturday that he considered the executive order \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very disappointing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also called the United States a \xe2\x80\x9chaven\xe2\x80\x9d for many athletes hoping to train outside their home countries.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost of our athletes from St. Lucia train in the States,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Peterkin said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have an issue because we\xe2\x80\x99re not on that list of seven, but if we were \xe2\x80\x94 there go hopes and dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Saturday evening, 'b'a federal judge blocked'b' part of the executive order, but that decision appeared unrelated to the elements of the ban that troubled sports officials.'b'The most immediate effect may come in wrestling, given that one of the nations affected by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ban is Iran, which has long had a congenial relationship with the United States in that sport. Iran said on Saturday that it would stop American citizens from entering the country, in retaliation for Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s order.'b'The United States freestyle wrestling team is scheduled to participate in a World Cup competition in Iran on Feb. 8. Steve Fraser, the chief fund-raiser for U.S.A. Wrestling and a 1984 Greco-Roman Olympic champion, said on Saturday that the president of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s wrestling federation was scheduled to meet this weekend with government officials there in an attempt to make sure the Americans would still be invited to the meet.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s some nervousness by us that the Iranian government might say, \xe2\x80\x98We can\xe2\x80\x99t get visas to go there, so no Americans can come here, either,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Fraser said.'b'While Olympic boycotts have resulted from tense political differences between nations, opposing countries have also long found common ground on playing fields, on the track and in sports arenas. One of the most celebrated examples is the so-called Ping-Pong diplomacy that helped foster the relationship between the United States and China in the 1970s.'b'In wrestling, the United States, Iran, Cuba and Russia banded together in 2013 to persuade the I.O.C. to keep the sport in the Summer Games. American wrestlers and officials are warmly welcomed in Iran, and Iranian wrestlers compete regularly in the United States. They may be invited to meets in May in New York and in June in Los Angeles, Mr. Fraser said. There is uncertainty now, however, about whether they would be granted P1 visas, commonly known as sports visas, to compete.'b'In 2014, Christina Kelley, the chief international ambassador for U.S.A. Wrestling, became one of the few women allowed into a wrestling arena in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution. She said on Saturday that she was frustrated by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think our current president has any clue what the State Department and what sports diplomats and cultural exchanges do for our country and for the safety of our people around the world,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Kelley said.'b'The ban on visitors from the seven nations \xe2\x80\x94 Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen \xe2\x80\x94 comes at a delicate time for the U.S.O.C. Los Angeles is seeking to host the 2024 Summer Games, and it will learn in September whether it, Paris or Budapest will get the Games.'b'(There is some speculation that the I.O.C. will award the 2024 Games to Paris and the 2028 Games to Los Angeles, but the U.S.O.C. remains committed to the bid for the 2024 Games.)'b'David Wallechinsky, an American member of the I.O.C.\xe2\x80\x99s cultural and heritage commission and the president of the International Society of Olympic Historians, said the election of Mr. Trump in November had hurt Los Angeles\xe2\x80\x99s bid with I.O.C. delegates because Mr. Trump was perceived as being \xe2\x80\x9canti-Muslim, anti-woman and anti-Latino.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is worse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wallechinsky said of the Muslim ban, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI would consider it a blow to the Los Angeles bid \xe2\x80\x94 not fatal but a blow.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At a meeting at the I.O.C.\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, several days after the American presidential election, Mr. Wallechinsky was asked repeatedly, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is wrong with your country?\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'He said he sought to assure I.O.C. officials by explaining that three-quarters of the voters in Los Angeles had voted against Mr. Trump, describing the city to them as a \xe2\x80\x9ca multicultural, Trump-free zone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The United States is expected to bid to host the world\xe2\x80\x99s other major sporting event, the World Cup, in 2026. In June, Sunil Gulati, president of the United States Soccer Federation, told reporters that a Trump presidency could complicate an American bid, especially if it were a joint bid with Mexico, given Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s plans to build a wall across America\xe2\x80\x99s southern border.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the White House,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gulati said at the time, in a reference to Hillary Clinton, who lost the election to Mr. Trump.'b'After Mr. Trump won the election, Mr. Gulati modified his remarks, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to dissuade us or persuade us to bid.\xe2\x80\x9d International perceptions of the Trump administration \xe2\x80\x9cmatter, for sure,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gulati said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I think those will be developed in the months to come.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'U.S. Soccer said Saturday it would have no immediate comment as it examined Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s order.'b'Many questions remained unanswered about the ability of a number of athletes to travel. Two N.B.A. players, Thon Maker and Luol Deng, were born in Sudan, one of the seven countries listed in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order. (Both, however, were born in Wau, now part of South Sudan, which gained its independence from Sudan in 2011.)'b'Mr. Maker\xe2\x80\x99s family fled Sudan when he was 5 and eventually settled in Australia. Mr. Maker, who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks, moved to the United States to play high school basketball in Louisiana, eventually moved to Canada and is an Australian citizen who holds a passport from that country. It was unclear how people with dual citizenship would be treated under the order.'b'Mr. Deng, a forward for the Los Angeles Lakers, has lived in the United States for 17 years. His family fled to Egypt when he was 5 to escape the Sudanese civil war. Mr. Deng came to the United States when he was 14 and attended high school in New Jersey, and he later became a British citizen.'b'The N.B.A. also holds an annual Basketball Without Borders camp, and it is expected to be held in New Orleans during the league\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star weekend in February. While rosters have not been released, last year\xe2\x80\x99s camp involved players from 25 countries, including Amir Reza Shah-Ravesh from Iran.'b'Major League Soccer has two American-born players with familial ties to two of the nations facing bans. Steve Beitashour of Toronto has played for Iran\xe2\x80\x99s national team, and Justin Meram of Columbus has played for Iraq. League officials were looking into the matter on Saturday.'b'Mo Farah of Britain, who was born in Somalia and has won four Olympic gold medals on the track at 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, is a Nike-sponsored athlete coached by Alberto Salazar.'b'Early Sunday morning Mr. Farah\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Facebook page had a post'b' that, among other things, said: \xe2\x80\x9cOn 1st January this year, Her Majesty The Queen made me a Knight of the Realm.
