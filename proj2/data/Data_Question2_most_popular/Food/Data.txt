b'People have fallen in love with their Instant Pots.'b'They may like their blenders, cherish their slow cookers and need their food processors.'b'But the 'b'Instant Pot'b' \xe2\x80\x94 a device that combines an electric pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker in one handy unit \xe2\x80\x94 sends even mild-mannered cooks into fits of passion.'b'You find the \xe2\x80\x9cL\xe2\x80\x9d word over and over in the 15,000 or so product reviews on Amazon. And if you click over to Instant Pot\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Facebook community page'b', you\xe2\x80\x99ll find more than 360,000 members sharing their undying affection alongside their recipes for chili. (A typical post: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m having an affair. My husband said he wished he would have never given me the Instant Pot for Christmas.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re a cook and got through last year without bumping into people who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop talking about their Instant Pots \xe2\x80\x94 or any of the other multifunctional electric pressure cookers on the market (Breville and Cuisinart both make versions) \xe2\x80\x94 then you won\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait much longer.'b'Electric pressure cookers is one of the fastest growing kitchen appliance sectors on the market, with sales doubling and tripling over the last four years, according to Robert Wang, the C.E.O. of Instant Pot Company.'b'When the Instant Pot debuted in 2009, it was one of the first brands to hit North America; electric pressure cookers were already gaining popularity in China. In 2010, approximately 300,000 electric pressure cookers were sold in the United States and Canada, said Dr. Wang. By 2015, that number rose to over three million. (He declined to give exact sales figures, as did representatives from Breville and Cuisinart.)'b'The majority of Instant Pots are sold on Amazon. More than 215,000 units were sold on 'b'Amazon Prime Day 2016'b', in July, when Prime members get discounts on select items, outperforming any other product on the site. Two different models of the Instant Pot currently sit in the 'b'top 10 list'b' of Amazon best sellers in the Kitchen and Dining category.'b'So why do electric pressure cookers inspire such a devoted following?'b'I bought one to find out.'b'A confession: I already own a stovetop pressure cooker, the conventional kind that you would heat over a burner and then regulate yourself. It is currently supporting a colony of dust bunnies in the back of my highest cabinet, behind the panini press. I never got over my fear of exploding split-pea soup to use it with any regularity.'b'What makes this newest generation of electric pressure cookers different is that it is designed with a slew of self-regulating safety features, including sensors to monitor the unit\xe2\x80\x99s temperature and amount of pressure. All you do is plug it in and tap a button, and it does everything else. It\xe2\x80\x99s as user-friendly as a slow cooker \xe2\x80\x94 except that it gets dinner on the table a day or so faster.'b'The promise of a fast, fresh homemade meal is a pressure cooker\xe2\x80\x99s greatest appeal, said 'b'Lorna Sass'b', author of four pioneering cookbooks on pressure cooking, including \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Pressure Perfect'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if you\xe2\x80\x99re Paleo or vegan or just trying to eat better, pressure cooking is the answer for healthy fast food,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Sass said.'b'After cooking a pork shoulder in the electric pressure cooker, I could easily see why the appliance has struck a chord, with the Paleo community in particular: It cooks large hunks of meat superbly and speedily. After a mere 90 minutes, the meat was spoon tender and deeply flavored, even before I covered the soft shreds with spicy barbecue sauce. The same recipe made in my slow cooker took seven hours, and the meat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as uniformly juicy.'b'It was that pork shoulder that turned me into a believer.'b'I continued to play, spending six weeks experimenting with the Instant Pot and a second electric pressure cooker, the 'b'Breville Fast Slow Pro'b'. These are the two models recommended by my colleagues at The Sweethome, a product review site owned by The New York Times Company that put 'b'six electric pressure cookers through their paces'b'. In terms of performance, I found the two to be more or less the same.'b'Lamb shanks were velvety soft in 40 minutes, short ribs fell off the bone in 30, and spare ribs were porky perfection in 20 minutes.'b'Perhaps most convenient, the collagen-rich beef bone broth that took two days to cook down in my slow cooker was ready in an afternoon, without making the whole house smell like soup (which is nice for the first couple of hours but then gets really old).'b'But the electric pressure cooker does have its shortcomings. The most notable failure in the meat category was the whole chicken. The recipes I tested came out with slack and soggy skin, and either stringy and dry white meat or undercooked dark meat. I did have more success with sake-steamed skinless chicken breasts, which were evenly cooked and perfumed with the delicate rice wine and fresh ginger. A nice dish, though how often does one really want to eat steamed skinless chicken breasts?'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t like it much for vegetables either, most of which don\xe2\x80\x99t benefit from the intense pressure of high-heat steam (beets and artichokes being the important exceptions here). Broccoli, kale, zucchini, fennel, brussels sprouts and mushrooms turned limp and unappealing.'b'They also took longer to cook than if I had used a skillet on the stove. The manual tells you an ingredient only needs, say, five minutes to cook, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take into account the 10 to 15 minutes required for the machine to build pressure, in addition to the time needed to release the pressure, which brings the total to around 20 minutes. I can do a lot of great things to vegetables with a skillet, some olive oil and garlic in 20 minutes. In general, this is a good rule of thumb: If something takes 20 minutes or less to cook conventionally on the stove, use the stove.'b'Another pressure cooker downside: They just don\xe2\x80\x99t do crisp or crunchy. Although most cookers allow you to brown meats and vegetables on the saut\xc3\xa9 function before cooking, any crunchy bits will wilt under the pressurized steam once you lock on the lid. Though I might use the pressure cooker for potatoes if I were going to mash them, I would never be able to achieve anything like the crisp-edged roasted potatoes I can get in the oven. And in the future, I\xe2\x80\x99ll stick to roasting my whole chickens, so I can crunch on the shards of browned, salty skin.'b'The key to pressure cooker happiness is choosing recipes in which softness and succulence is the goal, and which traditionally take hours to get there.'b'For example, I\xe2\x80\x99ll never go back to a Dutch oven for chili, which I made in the electric pressure cooker in an hour starting from dried beans.'b'Same goes for my favorite 'b'red lentil soup'b'. Although I didn\xe2\x80\x99t save any time when I tested it, I adored the convenience of not having to watch a pot on the stove. I could turn the pressure cooker on, then go for a run. When I got home, my soup was ready \xe2\x80\x94 a good thing since I was starving. And it\xe2\x80\x99s amazing for chickpeas, which take an hour all told instead of the usual three to four hours for unsoaked beans.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople want to use their pressure cookers for everything, but they\xe2\x80\x99re better for some things than others,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Sass said. \xe2\x80\x9cStick to soups, stews, beans and risotto. It makes fabulous risotto.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d have to agree; Ms. Sass\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'recipe for porcini mushroom risotto with peas'b' is excellent, adaptable and about as easy as dinner gets (once you source the dried porcinis and arborio rice, that is).'b'I also like the machine for polenta, which eliminates the stirring (and the splatters of molten blobs).'b'But perhaps the biggest pressure cooker joy I found was for something as simple as 'b'hard-cooked eggs'b'. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t cook faster, but even fresh eggs from the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market peeled effortlessly, without ending up pockmarked and riddled with craters the way they do when I boil them in a pot. This is because the pressure helps inflate the air pocket between the cooked white and the shell, which makes separating the two go more smoothly.'b'I also tried out some of the other functions, including the slow cooker, rice cooker and yogurt maker settings. The unit worked as well as my separate, stand-alone slow cooker, though I can see a future in which I pressure-cook more, and slow-cook less; the results are similar, but one is a whole lot faster. For cooking rice, I preferred both the brown and white rice I made in my separate rice cooker. The pressure cooker was faster, but the rice a bit heavier and chewier. And for yogurt, which I\xe2\x80\x99d gotten into the habit of making every other week on the stove, I have to admit that the machine worked like a dream.'b'So after all that cooking, did I fall in love with the electric pressure cooker?'b'It takes up a lot of space, it\xe2\x80\x99s not at all intuitive, and I hate not being able to check on my food as it cooks. But even so, I don\xe2\x80\x99t plan on giving mine up anytime soon.'b'My friend Robin, who bought an Instant Pot six month ago, summed it up well.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m out of the honeymoon phase,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re settling into a relationship. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted its limitations, like the fact that there\xe2\x80\x99s no reason to ever make oatmeal or rice in it. But between the lamb stew and the butternut squash soup, I know we will be together forever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Recipes: 'b''b'Pressure Cooker Chocolate Pudding'b''b' | 'b''b'Pressure Cooker Spicy Pork Shoulder'b''b' | 'b''b'Pressure Cooker Beef Short Ribs With Red Wine and Chile'b''b' | 'b''b'Pressure Cooker Pork Salad With Pomelo and Garlic Chips'b''b' | 'b''b'More Pressure Cooker Recipes'b''b''b'Start asking food people how to make the best black bean soup, and all roads will quickly lead to Steve Sando.'b'Very few can claim the title \xe2\x80\x9ccelebrity bean grower,\xe2\x80\x9d but Mr. Sando of 'b'Rancho Gordo'b' in Napa, Calif., is just that. He began by raising beans in his home garden, and was immediately impressed (and overwhelmed) by their high yield. To manage the overflow, he began selling them at the farmers\xe2\x80\x99 market in nearby Yountville. (Sharp-eyed food lovers will see where this is headed.) Yountville is home to the famed restaurant 'b'the French Laundry'b'; Mr. Sando\xe2\x80\x99s beans found their way into the hands of its chef, Thomas Keller. The rest is history.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99d never thought about why black bean soup is so much more savory than white or red, but Mr. Sando knew immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly black beans make that inky broth,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen they have that creamy center and fudgy, earthy flavor. They are really special.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Clearly, a person who appreciates beans so richly was right for the job of helping redeem black bean soup. The American classic can be a perfect dish: big-tasting, filling, nutritious, easy to prepare and very possibly vegetarian. But it has an unfortunate tendency to turn sludgy, bland or both. I set out to find a recipe that would resolve those issues.'b'The first matter is the type of bean used. Mr. Sando, who has 10 farmers in the Pacific Northwest growing dozens of varietals, raises at least three or four kinds of black beans, like the giant Ayocote Negro and the Black Valentine, a wine-dark kidney. But, he said, plain black turtle beans are the best for soup. They are the staple bean in much of southern Mexico, and the one associated with classic Brazilian feijoada and Cuban frijoles negros. Basic frijoles de olla, or pot beans, should be swimming in liquid, not sitting in sludge, and the same is true for black bean soup. The velvety, aromatic broth \xe2\x80\x94 called sopa negra or caldo de frijol \xe2\x80\x94 is prized by experienced bean cooks.'b'Like all dry beans \xe2\x80\x94 whether called borlotti or fagioli, cranberry or cannellini, alubias or frijoles \xe2\x80\x94 turtle beans are of American origin, first cultivated in Central and South America. These dry or \xe2\x80\x9ccommon\xe2\x80\x9d beans have tough outer pods that protect the beans as they mature. Other members of the bean family, such as favas, limas and cowpeas, grow in almost every part of the world. The Spanish saying \xe2\x80\x9cen todas partes se cuecen habas,\xe2\x80\x9d which figuratively suggests that everybody has the same problems, more literally means \xe2\x80\x9cpeople everywhere cook beans.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many New World beans caught on in Europe and beyond, but black beans have stayed stubbornly American. In the past, cooks in the United States treated black beans the same way they did other vegetables for soup: boiled them into submission, then ground them until smooth, in hopes of removing as much texture as possible. A 'b'New York Times recipe from 1879'b' instructed readers to boil the black beans for three to four hours, then rub them through a colander \xe2\x80\x9cinto a sort of paste.\xe2\x80\x9d This kind of soup was smooth and murky, and often thinned with cream, but it was considered elegant enough to serve with sliced lemon and sieved egg.'b'James Beard recommended stirring a glass of Madeira into black bean soup to brighten its flavors. (Actually, he recommended this in almost every soup recipe he published, and was usually right.)'b'Black beans were staples in vegetarian kitchens of the 1970s, and slipped into the culinary spotlight in the \xe2\x80\x9980s when Southwestern and Caribbean cooking became fashionable. In the 1980s, when the San Francisco chef 'b'Jeremiah Tower'b' served black bean cakes \xe2\x80\x94 thick tortillas made from black bean \xe2\x80\x9cdough,\xe2\x80\x9d pan-crisped and topped with cr\xc3\xa8me fra\xc3\xaeche and salsa \xe2\x80\x94 at his elegant San Francisco restaurant Stars, they became a sensation and a defining dish of California cuisine. Fortunately, the trend waned (goodbye forever, black bean-mango salsa), but black bean soup remains.'b'With their rich broth, turtle beans do not need bacon, chorizo, lard or any meaty ingredient to make a satisfying soup. But they do take on the flavor of the liquid and aromatics they are cooked in: water is fine, but stock adds another layer of taste.'b'Sometimes the problem with black bean soup is too much taste, and it becomes necessary to to cut the beans\xe2\x80\x99 intensity. This can be done with acid, like lime juice or vinegar; with the freshness of herbs, like oregano, bay leaves or the traditional epazote; or with heat, like roasted poblanos or chipotle chiles.'b'The transformative power of a can of chiles should not be underestimated. For the uninitiated, 'b'chipotles in adobo'b' are a world away from bland, canned jalape\xc3\xb1os. They are a smoky, fiery Mexican elixir that, like Thai curry paste or tahini, brings a blast of flavor and regional character to any dish.'b'Chipotle chiles themselves are ripe jalape\xc3\xb1os that are dried, then smoked. The adobo \xe2\x80\x94 a rough translation here would be \xe2\x80\x9cmarinade\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 is a paste of tomatoes, vinegar, onions, garlic and oregano, sometimes with spices like coriander and cumin. The chiles and adobo are sealed and cooked in the can, trading their flavors back and forth, into a rich, tangy mass. A few teaspoons of this mixture is an extraordinarily easy shortcut to a tasty pot of beans, especially when you let its flavors bloom by adding it to the pot early on. Beans, like potatoes, can happily absorb a lot of salt and spice, but go slowly.'b'The other shortcut to flavor here is the sofrito, aromatics and vegetables softened in hot oil that will flavor the cooking liquid, and thus the beans. The sofrito in this recipe is not traditional for black beans; it contains carrots and chiles in addition to onions and garlic, and it is deglazed with red wine. But it is extensively time-tested, having been cooked regularly by myself and many others since 1994, when a version was first published in the cookbook \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Bobby Flay\xe2\x80\x99s Bold American Food'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If you choose not to pur\xc3\xa9e it, this recipe can be served as pot beans instead of soup, on top of white rice or as a side dish for a dinner of quesadillas and avocado salad. For soup, pur\xc3\xa9eing some of the beans gives it a luxurious mouthfeel, like a cream soup. Either way, your leftovers (which will thicken overnight) can be mashed and cooked in oil (or lard, to be strictly traditional) to make refried beans.'b'I can already hear some of you asking if this can be made in a pressure cooker. Yes, but Mr. Sando advises against pressure because it forces the beans to absorb all the liquid, making them pudding-y instead of soupy. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t mind the loss of the broth, by all means use the pressure cooker, but keep some extra stock on hand. A pudding problem can also arise if you pur\xc3\xa9e too many of the beans: Their starches will flow into the liquid and turn it to mud. Go slowly, and don\xe2\x80\x99t let the immersion blender get away from you to go careening around the pot.'b'Other than that, Mr. Sando is surprisingly agnostic on the best way to cook beans, an eternal debate and the culinary equivalent of whether the Marvel or DC superheroes would win a battle for the universe. Soak or don\xe2\x80\x99t, use the slow cooker or the stove top, he said. All can work once you get the hang of them. He insists on just two rules: no salt until the beans are at least halfway cooked, and begin the cooking with a hard boil, lasting at least 10 to 15 minutes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe you have to show the beans who\xe2\x80\x99s boss,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThen they will obey you, and your recipe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Recipe: 'b''b'Best Black Bean Soup'b''b''b'SAN FERNANDO, Trinidad and Tobago \xe2\x80\x94 It is, at a glance, simple and unremarkable: a circle of flatbread as flaccid as a cotton cloth, with a texture not quite as doughy as pita bread, yet fluffier than a tortilla.'b'To a diner unfamiliar with the dish, it may look like an accessory, just a vehicle to get hearty helpings of meat and vegetables into the mouth. But roti, a staple of this West Indian island nation\xe2\x80\x99s cuisine, is anything but a culinary afterthought. It is so ingrained in the culture here that the term often refers to the bread combined with its accompaniments, typically a yellow curry stew of meat, potatoes and chickpeas.'b'When done right, this flatbread is silky and buttery and melts on the tongue in a puddle of succulent flavors. Preparing it, though, requires a lifetime of study.'b'Roti arrived on the island of Trinidad around the time slavery was abolished in the late 1830s, with indentured servants from India, where the unleavened flatbread has been popular for many centuries. Dhal puri, paratha and sada are the most readily available styles of roti in Trinidad.'b'Locals call their brand of paratha \xe2\x80\x9cbuss up shut,\xe2\x80\x9d which gets its name from the Trini pronunciation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbusted-up shirt,\xe2\x80\x9d a reference to what the dish looks like. Unlike traditional paratha in India, buss up shut is broken into pieces, and diners typically pick up the pieces with their hands and use them as utensils to scoop the curry. Sada is comparable to naan (minus the leavening) and usually eaten at breakfast with a choka, which is roasted and ground vegetables or fish.'b'Dhal puri is a roti stuffed with ground split peas. It\xe2\x80\x99s large, round and flat, and it\xe2\x80\x99s often wrapped around curry so it can be eaten like a sandwich. While dhal puri is cooked on a griddle, the puri in India is deep-fried and smaller than the Trinidadian iteration, said 'b'Chitrita Banerji'b', the author of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Eating India: An Odyssey Into the Food and Culture of the Land of Spices'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d The portability of a dhal puri (with curry inside) makes it a popular grab-and-go street food and lunch option.'b'Rostan Amin, 84, a Muslim Trinidadian whose ancestors are from India, began his roti empire with a grocery store in San Fernando in the 1960s. His roti appealed to the workers at a nearby oil refinery. The grocery store eventually closed, but the restaurant business has expanded. There are now 10 branches throughout the country.'b'The Amin family\xe2\x80\x99s restaurant looks much like any roti shop you may see here or around the globe, from Brooklyn to Toronto. It is sparse, with a counter and a few wooden tables for those who want to stick around to eat.'b'Mr. Amin\xe2\x80\x99s son, Haseeb Amin, 57, who goes by Pope, and one of his grandsons, Kaleem Amin, 33, now run the operation, but the patriarch still puts in time \xe2\x80\x94 he lives above the flagship restaurant and regularly wakes up early to knead the dough.'b'Kaleem Amin said he can tell his grandfather\xe2\x80\x99s work, as opposed to that of the staff. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, if I come in the morning, I would know the difference if my grandfather kneaded the flour, because when he kneads the flour, you don\xe2\x80\x99t even need to chew the roti,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt literally melts in your mouth.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'How, exactly, does the elder Amin accomplish such a perfect knead?'b'The answer is what makes preparing the perfect roti so difficult for home cooks: experience.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnless you\xe2\x80\x99ve grown up in the kind of community where somebody in your family was teaching you to do it since you were 7, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anu Lakhan, a food writer in Trinidad.'b'Making roti is as much about eyeballing as measuring, tradition as instruction. Trinidadians see it as an art form. It\xe2\x80\x99s time consuming, and challenging, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it was never documented in a manner in which people can duplicate it easily,\xe2\x80\x9d said Chris De La Rosa, the founder of 'b'CaribbeanPot.com'b'.'b'Those new to roti-making are often surprised by how difficult it is, as cookbook instructions are straightforward and ingredients are few: flour, water, salt, baking powder and oil as its base, with seasonings and additions, depending on the style.'b'Mr. De La Rosa\xe2\x80\x99s cooking website supplements recipes with videos to help illustrate what the prose cannot. A native of Trinidad, Mr. De La Rosa now lives in Hamilton, Ontario. His site started as a way to teach his daughters how to prepare some of his favorite Caribbean dishes.'b'Portioning ingredients correctly is an important first step in achieving the right roti texture. The slightest ratio imbalance could throw off the roti. What you want is a very soft dough, Kaleem Amin said, but not so soft that it breaks apart. His father, Pope Amin, said that when mixing the dough, you know it is ready when you can stick your finger in it and your finger comes out clean.'b'With dhal puri, the well-seasoned split-pea filling, which provides the flavor, is just as important as supple dough.'b'The split peas must be boiled to the correct texture, not too mushy and not too hard, Pope Amin said. When pinched with the fingers, a perfectly boiled split pea will crumble into a chalky paste. The peas are then ground into a fine powder with 'b'culantro'b' (an intense, cilantro-like seasoning called chadon beni here), cumin, turmeric, garlic and salt.'b'Stuffing the dhal puri requires dexterity. A handful of the split-pea powder is piled onto a slightly flattened ball of dough. One hand packs the filling, while the other squeezes the dough, as if wrapping a baby in a blanket. It is important that the dough is pinched and sealed so that the filling does not spill out when it is flattened into a large, thin circle with a rolling pin.'b'From there, the dough is plopped onto a tawa, a large cast-iron griddle. The dough is oiled, flipped and oiled again. It should take only about 30 seconds to cook, turning it a light brown on both sides. When air bubbles inflate the dough as it heats on the griddle, that\xe2\x80\x99s a sign it is ready.'b'For home cooks, a nonstick frying pan could be used in place of a tawa, Mr. De La Rosa said.'b'Then comes the easy part: wrapping the roti around generous portions of curry to eat like a burrito, or tearing off pieces of roti and using them to scoop curry into your mouth.'b'Shortly before 11 on a Friday night in January, Justin Saurer parked his car on a gritty Brooklyn street that was best known for its McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s and proximity to the toxic Gowanus Canal until 'b'Other Half Brewing Company'b' opened in 2014.'b'Mr. Saurer craved a first crack at the special India pale ale that Other Half had created to celebrate its third anniversary. But the cans wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t go on sale until the brewery opened at 10 a.m.'b'What was 11 hours, given his plum perch?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re the first one here, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about parking,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Saurer, 38, said the next morning. A firefighter and a father of an infant daughter at home, he drove in from Amityville, on Long Island, with a sleeping bag. \xe2\x80\x9cI have the best sleep in the car,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no kids screaming.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The frigid daybreak had revealed a high-spirited line hundreds of beer lovers deep, snaking around several blocks. Among those waiting, many of them drinking cans from coolers, were Michael Roulhac and his wife, Kim Roulhac, who had left Richmond, Va., at 1 a.m. and driven straight to Brooklyn. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re road warriors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Roulhac, 40, who regularly makes the round trip to Other Half.'b'Scenes like this play out nearly every day across the country as supplicants (\xe2\x80\x9ckind of like a beer brotherhood,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Saurer said) queue up outside breweries for new releases of I.P.A.s \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, a cloudy, unfiltered New England style that is loved for its flavors of citrus and tropical fruit.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are fanatical about it, to the point they don\xe2\x80\x99t want to drink anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam Richardson, the brew master and a founder of Other Half. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone has this expectation of getting hazy I.P.A.s in a can directly from a brewery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fan base for these special-edition ales has been growing since the early 2010s, creating excitement and a new revenue stream for the craft-beer business.

Coming in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest school system, and potentially spreading to other large districts that collaborate with New York in bulk purchases, it is one of the biggest signs to date of the inroads that small food companies are making into the mainstream.'b'But the change also highlights the many hurdles facing small food companies and advocates of better nutrition, years after the federal government started pressing school districts to improve their menus.'b'Last summer, 'b'Kellogg'b' discontinued two Kashi cereals, Berry Blossoms and Honey Sunshine, that were on the schools\xe2\x80\x99 breakfast menu. But instead of replacing them with other Kellogg cereals, the schools opted to buy Back to the Roots cereals because of their better nutritional profile and organic ingredients, said Eric Goldstein, the chief executive of the Office of School Support Services, which oversees food operations of the city\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Department of Education'b'.'b'Today, the 254,000 students, on average, who eat a free breakfast in city schools are offered two Back to the Roots cereals in addition to three more conventional choices from General Mills, Kellogg and Post Foods.'b'One 28-gram serving of Back to the Roots Cinnamon Clusters, for instance, has half as much sugar and four-fifths as many calories as the same amount of Kellogg\xe2\x80\x99s Frosted Mini-Wheats, which are still offered in New York schools. The Kellogg product is made of five ingredients, including the preservative butylated hydroxytoluene and gelatin, and has eight added 'b'vitamins'b'. The Back to the Roots cereal has just four ingredients, no preservatives and no added vitamins; it is certified organic, and organic vitamins are hard to find.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBreakfast is really important to us, and we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to get our menu to where we want it to be,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Goldstein of the school district, where all 1.1 million students are eligible for free breakfasts. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the world we live in, though, there are so many constraints, so being able to offer Back to the Roots cereals for us is like a breath of fresh air.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Public schools are under enormous pressure to contain costs and provide foods that children will actually eat, factors that make it harder to offer higher-quality foods.'b'In 2010, Congress passed the 'b'Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act'b', the first significant overhaul of school meal programs in about 15 years. The law updated the nutritional standards school districts must meet to qualify for federal subsidies and all but banished soda, candy and other junk food.'b'Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the 'b'Center for Science in the Public Interest'b', said schools have made huge improvements since the regulations went into effect in 2012 and 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not anywhere near perfect,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this is a journey toward providing healthier meals that kids will like.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Goldstein said New York City spends 90 cents to $1 on food for each school breakfast, and has a hard time finding suppliers who can deliver products to fit that budget and at the volume needed.'b'That was the challenge for Back to the Roots, which started to woo New York school officials about a year ago. The eight-year-old company in Oakland, Calif., is tiny compared with General Mills and Kellogg. And though it had landed its cereals in school lunchrooms in Pasadena and San Jose, Calif., and in Phoenix, Mr. Goldstein questioned whether the company could guarantee a consistent supply.'b'Then there was the cost. An 11-ounce carton of Back to the Roots cereal costs $4 to $5 in stores, while a similar-size box of a Kashi cereal from Kellogg is around $3.50.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cProducing a food product that is fundamentally better for kids and that kids are going to want to eat at the scale and consistency needed is a huge challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sam Kass, who was assistant chef in the White House during most of the Obama administration and oversaw Michelle Obama\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to improve children\xe2\x80\x99s diets.'b'It was Mr. Kass who introduced Mr. Goldstein, an old friend, to Back to the Roots. Mr. Kass is an investor in the company through his role as a partner at 'b'Acre Venture Partners'b', which invests in food businesses.'b'The next potential obstacle was students\xe2\x80\x99 taste buds, which have been conditioned to crave cereals containing at least six grams of sugar, or twice the amount in Back to the Roots cereals. (Many cereals in the grocery store contain 13 grams or more.)'b'For three years, the school system has been testing foods with children of all ages and soliciting their opinions.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve learned the hard way that we had to stop making decisions here about what kids would eat and let kids tell us what they would eat,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Goldstein said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t test anything unhealthy, but within the realm of what\xe2\x80\x99s possible in terms of healthiness and cost, we let the kids decide.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The results of those tests are sometimes surprising. Back to the Roots was convinced that its Cocoa Crisps cereal would be a home run, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the favorite among the students. They liked Purple Corn Flakes best. \xe2\x80\x9cThe milk turns purple, and kids love that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Goldstein said.'b'That turned into a problem last fall, when Back to the Roots had trouble finding enough organic purple corn to fill the district\xe2\x80\x99s order.'b'Food companies have software to help them stay in stock in grocery stores, but Alejandro Velez, a founder of Back to the Roots, said there is nothing similar for school cafeterias. \xe2\x80\x9cYou literally are doing calculations on the back of an envelope,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Velez said.'b'The school district pays a little more for Back to the Roots cereals, but Mr. Goldstein said that is more than offset by their popularity among students, their organic ingredients and their lower sugar content.'b'Asked for comment, Kellogg officials said only that they had discontinued the two cereals that have been replaced.'b'Back to the Roots is among a growing number of smaller food companies looking to join school lunchrooms. Revolution Foods, perhaps the grandmother of the bunch, got its start in 2006 by providing healthier lunches made from fewer and higher-quality ingredients, an alternative to what the big food service companies that supply most school districts were offering.'b'This year, the 'b'Plant Based Foods Association'b', a trade group for companies that make things like nut-based butters and cheeses and soy milks, plans to push to make school food policy more open to alternatives to meats and dairy products.'b'Mr. Kass said he sees that effort as part of a transition that\xe2\x80\x99s been going on for the last several years, as the big food companies long dominant on grocery shelves are displaced by smaller, more nimble start-ups. \xe2\x80\x9cNow these companies are able to talk to a contractor like the New York City public school system, which is not only interested in getting better food into school cafeterias, but also is willing to take a risk on a young company,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Nikhil Arora, the other founder of Back to the Roots, said the company was working with the school system to create cereals to replace some of the mainstream ones that remain in the schools. (In addition to Back to the Roots Cinnamon Clusters and Purple Corn Flakes, the district\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast menu for March features Multi Grain Cheerios from General Mills; Frosted Mini-Wheats and Cinnamon Flakes from Kellogg; and a raisin bran from Post Foods.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be a faster process now with the support of the district and proven brand acceptance by the kids,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Arora said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich is the hardest part.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s decision to support the company could lead to more business, as Mr. Goldstein is chairman of the 'b'Urban School Food Alliance'b', a consortium of some of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest school districts \xe2\x80\x94 in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, Dallas, Orlando, Fla., and, soon, Broward County, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 that buys cafeteria supplies together to secure better prices.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat age-old thing about if you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere should stand up in this case,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kass said.'b'Gnocchi, those savory little dumplings, are frequently offered as a first course in Italian restaurants, as an alternative to a pasta course. Other times, a larger portion may make a fine hot lunch, or just a few gnocchi can round out a main course, sidled up to a saucy braised veal shank.'b'The secret to making magnificent tender gnocchi at home is the same as the old joke about how to get to Carnegie Hall: practice, practice, practice.'b'This is especially true with potato gnocchi; a beginner\xe2\x80\x99s attempts usually produce tough, chewy specimens. Overhandled dough and too much added flour may be the culprits, but in truth, there is a learning curve. Expertise is achieved only by repetition, until you acquire the feel for it.'b'There are, however, many other kinds of traditional Italian gnocchi that don\xe2\x80\x99t use potatoes at all. Gnocchi alla romana, for example, is a golden, crisp-topped baked dish made with slices of cooked semolina splashed with cream, butter and cheese. That kind is easier to execute.'b'And most home cooks can find success making ricotta gnocchi, which, when at their best, can be exceedingly light and delicate (and still pretty darned good even when they\xe2\x80\x99re not completely perfect). Essentially, they are made from ricotta and eggs, a touch of Parmesan and a handful of flour.'b'Good, fresh ricotta is critical. Use the very best you can find, typically available at any good Italian deli or well-stocked cheese shops. (The grainy low-fat commercial type doesn\xe2\x80\x99t qualify here.) Drain your ricotta well before making the recipe, or the dough will be too wet. Put it in a fine mesh sieve set over a bowl, for several hours or overnight. You will be surprised by how much liquid whey seeps out. I sometimes drink a glass of it (it makes a pleasant beverage and is known to be highly nutritious) or save it to use in soups or smoothies.'b'When mixing the dough for ricotta gnocchi \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s really more like a stiff batter \xe2\x80\x94 add the least amount of flour possible. The ethereal custardy ricotta gnocchi served at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco have no flour at all, and the dough must be dropped by the spoonful into simmering water. Those are the lightest ricotta dumplings I know.'b'But I learned in Italy that adding a small amount (\xc2\xbc to \xc2\xbd cup) of all-purpose flour to the dough and using fine semolina flour for dusting the work surface makes it possible to roll the dough into long ropes. Use scissors to snip the ropes into gnocchi shapes. I like to let the shaped gnocchi rest on a semolina-dusted baking sheet for an hour before cooking them, but it\xe2\x80\x99s fine to skip that step.'b'Ricotta gnocchi are wonderful served in broth or with a light tomato sauce. Another classic preparation has them swimming in butter with sage leaves. But my latest favorite version is to sauce them with a simple parsley pesto, and to finish with a shower of chopped pistachios and Parmesan.'b'Recipe: 'b''b'Ricotta Gnocchi With Parsley Pesto'b''b''b''b'And to Drink ...'b''b'These feathery dumplings, with the herbal tang of parsley pesto, call for a penetrating white wine that will cut through their richness but won\xe2\x80\x99t be too sharp. The options are many. Fianos from Campania would be delicious, as would good Soaves. If you can find a decent vernaccia di San Gimignano, that would be fine. French wines would be terrific, particularly aligot\xc3\xa9s from Burgundy and Muscadets from the Atlantic. Vermentinos from Liguria or Corsica would also work well. If you prefer a red, basic Chianti is the choice. ERIC ASIMOV'b'Having opened seven restaurants in eight years, 'b'Albert Adri\xc3\xa0'b' did not need to open another.'b'Mr. Adri\xc3\xa0, 47, has explored the intersection of modern Spanish cuisine and other traditions more than perhaps any other chef. Five of his restaurants are in the same neighborhood here, creating a kind of culinary theme park that lures some 100,000 diners \xe2\x80\x94 half of them foreigners \xe2\x80\x94 in a year.'b'But the spirit of El Bulli demanded to be heard. That trailblazing modernist outpost on the Costa Brava of Catalonia closed in 2011, leaving behind a legacy as one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most influential restaurants. Mr. Adri\xc3\xa0 was El Bulli\xe2\x80\x99s pastry chef, and he worked there for 23 years alongside his brother, 'b'Ferran Adri\xc3\xa0'b', its creative force.'b'So Albert Adri\xc3\xa0 had everything he needed \xe2\x80\x94 the experience, the will and the audacity \xe2\x80\x94 to revisit El Bulli. The result is 'b'Enigma'b', which opened in January not as a re-creation of El Bulli, but as an attempt to reimagine it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the El Bulli of 2011,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Adri\xc3\xa0 said. \xe2\x80\x9cEnigma is what El Bulli would be in 2017.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like its predecessor, Enigma offers cuisine that is wide-ranging and complex. But it focuses instead on the ingredients and their intrinsic tastes rather than revolutionary techniques, like the foams and spheres that distinguished El Bulli. Unlike that restaurant, Enigma serves cocktails and elaborate snacks. And where El Bulli\xe2\x80\x99s d\xc3\xa9cor was rustic, Enigma\xe2\x80\x99s ambience is futuristic and cool \xe2\x80\x94 indeed, the tables and chairs look as though they were carved from blocks of ice.'b'Located as it is on the main floor of a bland office building, Enigma has an anonymous-looking entrance that requires a code number for admission, provided when the guest pays an advance deposit online. Inside, diners begin a journey through six separate spaces, sprawling over 7,500 square feet, where they are served a tasting menu of more than 40 small dishes. The meal costs about $235, excluding drinks.'b'The first space features waist-high tables where guests stand and receive a hot hand towel and hibiscus tea accompanied by two bite-size tastes that will vary: one night they were a freeze-dried strawberry with fresh wasabi and pomegranate vinegar, and ice crystals of yuzu saki with fresh wasabi and yuzu shavings.'b'Diners glimpse what is to come through hanging opaque panels that look like corrugated ice. If the planet Krypton had an elegant restaurant, this would be it. The tufted aluminum netting on the ceiling, shot through here and there with purple and blue lighting, is matched by the gray crepe outfits of the servers.'b'Open five nights a week, Enigma serves only 24 people at a time (it plans to increase that to 30) in a choreography flowing from one space to the next, including a cocktail bar and a flattop grill where diners can watch the preparation. When served at a table, dishes are often set down in front of diners without comment; the server waits to see if the guest wants to know the ingredients before tasting. Most like to try to decipher what they are eating and hear about it afterward, Mr. Adri\xc3\xa0 said.'b'Some dishes send taste receptors into overdrive, like the squid tartar brushed with a thin layer of coconut oil and a drop of slightly spicy squid ink. Others are gorgeously simple: a Raf tomato cut in half, with one cream made of the red part and another of the green, poured into the same bowl.'b'At the end of evening, about three hours later, guests are suddenly led into a back-room storage area and through a door into a traditional bar for drinks and further tastes. The spell fades slowly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bore people or be too pompous,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Adri\xc3\xa0 said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the worst would be indifference.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Enigma, 'b''b'Sep\xc3\xbalveda Street, 38-40, 'b''b''b'Barcelona'b', Spain; reservations: 'b'enigmaconcept.es'b''b'.'b'They don\xe2\x80\x99t normally call Utica greens Utica greens in Utica.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomebody calls here and says they want Utica greens, I tell them we don\xe2\x80\x99t have those,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sal Borruso, owner of the 'b'Chesterfield Restaurant'b' in this city of 60,000 in central New York.'b'In 1988, Chesterfield\xe2\x80\x99s began serving the hearty dish of escarole, fried prosciutto, hot cherry peppers, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and bread crumbs.'b'It went on to become one of those American specialties that are beloved as a regional staple without reaching much further. From 'b'Albany'b' to 'b'Syracuse'b', the dish is served in Italian-American restaurants as Utica greens.'b'But not so much in Utica.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re greens Morelle,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Borruso, 55, said, standing at his restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s gleaming wooden bar. The \xe2\x80\x9cMorelle\xe2\x80\x9d is Joe Morelle, the 59-year-old man in a red V-neck sweater, buzz cut and gray mustache who sat nearby, sipping a Scotch and water and explaining the dish\xe2\x80\x99s murky origins.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUs being Italian, our grandmothers all made greens,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Morelle said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would call it \xe2\x80\x99scarole. Just saut\xc3\xa9ed with garlic and olive oil.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some Uticans remember a more elaborate version of the dish that was served at home tables. Others recall them as Mr. Morelle does: simple, with the possible addition of chickpeas or sausage.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI did something different with them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t really say invent. But I will take credit for popularizing them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Escarole is a leafy, slightly bitter winter green in the endive family. Its heads typically weigh more than a pound, and its firm leaves range from dark green to pale white. It was a staple in the backyard gardens of East Utica, where, beginning in the late 1800s, immigrants from southern Italy arrived to work in the mills and on the railroad.'b'Utica became renowned for its Italian-American cuisine, with specialties that include fried meatballs, sausage rolls, tomato pie and a mildly spicy pasta dish called chicken riggies.'b'In the 1980s, Mr. Morelle was a chef at Grimaldi\xe2\x80\x99s Restaurant, a venerated spot that is now closed, where the greens were served as an occasional special. He observed a chef making them, and when he started at Chesterfield\xe2\x80\x99s in 1988, he tweaked the dish and put it on the menu as a regular appetizer. It was an immediate hit.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe place was packed,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Borruso recalled. Referring to those days, when Utica was known as Sin City for its political corruption, Mr. Morelle said: \xe2\x80\x9cYou knew everybody. On this half was the F.B.I. That half, wiseguys.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The dish varies from menu to menu. Potatoes are added here, salami replaces prosciutto there. In Utica, the name often honors the chef or the house: greens Trunfio, Georgio greens, greens alla Ventura. Local residents frequently call them fried greens or just greens. Versions have popped up at a few restaurants in New York City, Las Vegas and Florida.'b'Years ago, Mr. Morelle quit the restaurant business to work as a postman. He still makes greens, but only on request \xe2\x80\x94 huge trays of them for weddings, birthdays and holidays.'b'As he nursed his drink at Chesterfield\xe2\x80\x99s, Mr. Morelle was asked to try the restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s version. He took a bite, then another. \xe2\x80\x9cThey taste pretty close to mine,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe bread crumb mixture is a little different. A little drier. But they\xe2\x80\x99re good. Really good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Someone urged him to try some more. He thought for a moment, then declined. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t eat them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Recipe: 'b''b'Utica Greens'b''b''b'Eating at a professional football game can be as brutal as a hit from the Atlanta Falcons safety Keanu Neal.'b'That became clear to 'b'Andrew Zimmern'b', the chef, television personality and devoted sports fan, on a chilly February evening a few years ago at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey.'b'He was watching the Seattle Seahawks pummel the Denver Broncos in 'b'Super Bowl'b' XLVIII when a guy selling hot chocolate walked by.

He needed another $20 for the other hot chocolate, which Mr. Zimmern recalls as a lukewarm cup of thin brown liquid.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was so insulted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the same way I feel when I go to a game and I order a hot dog and it\xe2\x80\x99s a $12 piece of crap.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When the opportunity came to create a menu for the $1.13 billion 'b'Minnesota Vikings stadium'b', which opened last year, he vowed to make football food better.'b'As another Super Bowl nears, the Vikings, with a few other teams in the National Football League, are leading a charge to upgrade food in the tradition-bound world of football-stadium concessions, one of the last big captive markets to address fans\xe2\x80\x99 broadening culinary sensibilities.'b'That bad cup of hot chocolate inspired a frozen version made with local cream and dark chocolate, which Mr. Zimmern sells for $8 at one of the two concessions he operates at the U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. Along with his cumin-marinated rotisserie lamb sandwich and two other sandwiches he created with his stadium food partner, 'b'Gavin Kaysen'b' of 'b'Spoon and Stable'b' in Minneapolis, it made a list of the 'b'best food at the new stadium 'b'compiled by Rick Nelson, the restaurant critic for The Star Tribune.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Vikings have done a nice job of making people want to go inside and eat,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Nelson said, even though \xe2\x80\x9cthey\xe2\x80\x99re hiding the fact that they are still peddling a lot of schlock.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Food has been steadily improving in places like airports, movie theaters and concert arenas, where people gather for reasons other than to eat. In professional sports, baseball has led the way, driven in part by 22 major league stadiums that have been built since 1990.'b'Although staples like hot dogs, pizza and popcorn still make up about two-thirds of food sales in sports stadiums, baseball menus have matured to include gochujang-glazed eggplant buns, fresh Dungeness crab sandwiches, ceviche, espresso and craft beer.'b'Football has lagged behind baseball largely because the sports are different, people in the concession business say. Baseball is played at a slower pace, with built-in breaks that allow fans to wander around a stadium sampling food. The crowds are smaller, and stadiums are open for about 80 games a season, which makes it easier to polish and sustain creative concessions.'b'Football is a different beast. Crowds can top 80,000 fans, most of whom want to be in their seats for every play and visit concession stands only before the game and at halftime. With just eight regular home games a season, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to create a system that produces consistently great food.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe doors open and 65,000 people come in, and you don\xe2\x80\x99t open your doors again for a week,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Zimmern said.'b'Then there is tailgating, although it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say whether bad stadium food led to tailgating or tailgating led to less emphasis on food inside the stadium.'b'NRG Stadium in Houston, where this year\xe2\x80\x99s Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, has one of the strongest tailgating games in the league, said Robb Walsh, the Texas food journalist who researched it for his 2010 book, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Tex-Mex Grill and Backyard Barbacoa Cookbook'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re talking about stellar barbecuing, with these giant land yachts that unfurl giant TV screens,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Walsh said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is more fun than going inside to eat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'N.F.L. franchises are starting to respond to complaints about both the cost and the quality of stadium food, team representatives said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we ask fans what\xe2\x80\x99s the No. 1 pain point, it\xe2\x80\x99s food,\xe2\x80\x9d said Rich McKay, the president and chief executive of the Atlanta Falcons, who will play the New England Patriots this weekend. So next season, when the Falcons open their $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium downtown, they plan to sell the least expensive food in the N.F.L.'b'Lowering prices was a mandate from Arthur Blank, a founder of the Home Depot, who owns the team. He wanted a family of four to be able to eat at the stadium for about $28.'b'That means hot dogs, soda or a bottle of water will each cost $2. A 12-ounce beer will be $5. The rest of the core menu of what the team calls fan favorites will be priced significantly lower than at other stadiums, where the average price of a hot dog is $5.19 and a beer $7.38, according to the market research agency 'b'Team Marketing Report'b'.'b'To make the economics work, the Falcons struck a deal with 'b'Levy Restaurants'b', one of several national companies that provide food at N.F.L. stadiums. The agreement gives the team more control over setting prices but could cost it in profits. (Although concession sales are a small slice of the income for N.F.L. teams, 'b'profit margins'b' can reach 77 percent.)'b'The food is likely to taste better than it did at the Georgia Dome, the old stadium, which will be torn down this year. The menu is expanding to include fresh handmade pretzels and the Mitchell dog, which rests in a sweet bun that tastes like a glazed doughnut. It is topped with bacon jam and Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese.'b'Vendors from Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s beloved 89-year-old drive-in 'b'the Varsity'b' will roam the stands yelling, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99ll ya have?\xe2\x80\x9d just as they do at the restaurant. Booths will offer favorites from other local restaurants, including Antico Pizza, Delia\xe2\x80\x99s Chicken Sausage Stand, Farm Burger and Fox Bros. Bar-B-Q. Falcons managers say they will bar the restaurants from charging more for food at the stadium than they do at their restaurants.'b'The Falcons are also installing a raised-bed garden for cooks and bartenders working at the stadium. It\xe2\x80\x99s the league\xe2\x80\x99s second. A 4,000-square-foot 'b'rooftop farm was planted'b' at Levi\xe2\x80\x99s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., which opened in 2014 as the home for the San Francisco 49ers.'b''b'Kevin Gillespie'b', a star of the Atlanta restaurant scene who rose to fame as a \xe2\x80\x9cTop Chef\xe2\x80\x9d contestant, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to join the food revolution at the stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cMy family has had tickets to the Falcons my entire life, and I have always just accepted that the food at a football game is terrible,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gillespie said.'b'But now younger fans who grew up eating better food are pressuring teams to change. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x98Why can\xe2\x80\x99t we have football alongside good food and drink?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'His stadium restaurant, called Game Changer, will sell a homage to the In-N-Out Burger and his popular Closed on Sunday fried chicken sandwich, which he makes at 'b'Revival'b', his restaurant in Decatur, Ga. (He named it that because the owners of 'b'Chick-fil-A'b', whose chicken sandwich inspired his, never open their restaurants on Sundays.)'b'Mr. Gillespie plans to serve a rotating \xe2\x80\x9cdevour the competition\xe2\x80\x9d dish inspired by the opponent. If he were to create one for this year\xe2\x80\x99s Super Bowl, he said, it would be a New England lobster roll.'b'Unlike restaurant fare, stadium food depends as much on logistics as on culinary acumen. Even little details like the placement of the napkin holders or the soda machine can make a big difference in waiting times for fans eager to get back to their seats.'b'To understand how to better design the concession stands at the new Falcons stadium, Mr. McKay worked the soda line at a game this season. \xe2\x80\x9cHalftime was like, \xe2\x80\x98Whoa, put a helmet on,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was the bottleneck.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Managers realized that they could save 17 seconds per transaction if they moved soda machines from behind the counter and let customers serve themselves. They also decided to pull more beer from taps; it\xe2\x80\x99s faster than opening a bottle and pouring into a cup. And everything is priced in dollar increments so servers don\xe2\x80\x99t have to make change.'b'Those adjustments make a huge difference at games, where the crews working the stands are often volunteers from nonprofit groups that keep a small percentage of the profits.'b'Still, N.F.L. teams have never made a lot of money from concession stands, and neither do the chefs working to make the food better. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a moneymaker,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Zimmern, the Minneapolis chef. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a business card.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of fun, and a challenge. That is why he will meet several N.F.L. executives and food service executives at the Super Bowl in a quest to get his food into every stadium in the country.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like a crossword puzzle,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI love it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The cookbook author Lorna Sass offers advice for cooks who want to convert their favorite recipes for use in a pressure cooker, either electric or stovetop.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Plan on about a third of the standard cooking time for meats, vegetables and grains, with beans taking a quarter of the standard cook time. There are 'b' pressure cooking charts'b' online that break down timing by ingredient; use those as a general guideline.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Avoid cooking lean meats like pork loin in the pressure cooker; they will dry out. Anything that braises well is a good fit.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 If you end up with a thin sauce, open the cooker and use the saut\xc3\xa9 function to evaporate some of the liquid.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Although high pressure is the default setting, you can use low pressure for more delicate ingredients like eggs, custards, chicken breasts and seafood. It takes a bit longer, but there\xe2\x80\x99s less of a chance of overcooking.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 If you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to use manual release but want to speed up your electric pressure cooker\xe2\x80\x99s natural release, unplug the pot and place a cold, damp dish towel on the cover of the pot (not the sides, which are insulated). This helps bring down the temperature.'b''b'MR BING'b' \xe2\x80\x9cDid you ever have a jianbing?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Brian Goldberg, the entrepreneur who just opened a more permanent kiosk in Manhattan than his usual pop-ups, which sell rolled crepes typical of Beijing street food. To answer: Yes, back in 2000, from a food truck outside the Peking Opera School, which we were visiting in Beijing. They were delicious. I had forgotten about jianbing until very recently, as a few people in New York have started making them. Mr. Goldberg, a Chinese scholar who grew up in Spring Valley, N.Y., in Rockland County, became a professional luge racer and worked in finance before running a couple of places in Hong Kong. He decided a few years ago to do something, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat would be interesting and make people happy.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99d like to do his part to make jianbing as mainstream as ramen. At his colorful stand, cooks spread a thin film of batter made with mung bean and rice flours onto a griddle, break an egg on it, add herbs and condiments, flip it, roll it and cut it in two. He has come up with nontraditional versions with roast duck, marinated chicken or roast pork. The stand also sells smashed cucumber salad, steamed dumplings and, soon, an egg, cheese and ham breakfast \xe2\x80\x9cbing\xe2\x80\x9d and sweet dessert versions. Mr. Goldberg has also taken on a couple of partners and has plans for expansions, including a brick-and-mortar shop opening in March next to his commissary in Chelsea: 'b'Mr Bing, UrbanSpace Vanderbilt, 45th Street and Vanderbilt Avenue, 'b'mr-bing'b''b''b''b'.com'b'.'b''b''b'DIANNE &amp; ELISABETH'b' This wine bar serves snacks, cheeses and charcuterie, along with dishes like boneless short ribs, creamed kale, croquettes and beet pasta with goat and ricotta cheese, most of which can be ordered in small or large portions: 'b'644 10th Avenue (45th Street), 917-472-7808, 'b'dianneandelisabeth'b''b'.com'b'.'b''b''b'KINGS OF KOBE'b' The owners of this former pop-up, which is putting down roots, proclaim their hot dogs and hamburgers to be made from 100 percent American Kobe beef \xe2\x80\x94 never mind that there\xe2\x80\x99s no such thing; it\xe2\x80\x99s Wagyu.

The nuts themselves were pulverized and powdery, ruining the texture of the confection.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBaklava has delicate feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Homsi, 76. He stood in his small kitchen in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, waving the creases out of sheer, supple phyllo dough.'b'Before he and his wife, Nawal Wardeh, fled Syria last year, the couple owned a bakery in the city of Hama for more than 30 years. They have sold their Syrian sweets, including baklava, at outdoor markets in New York, and have just started a website, 'b'Syrian Sweet Refuge'b', for online sales. They plan to rent an industrial kitchen in Sunset Park for large orders.'b'Back in Hama, the pair also baked bread, cookies and wedding cakes. When the government cut off their supplies of flour or butter, they, like other Syrians caught in the war, struggled to get on with their lives and their work.'b'They adapted, baking whatever they could with the ingredients on hand, sometimes making purchases on the black market. A stack of cookies or even a few crackers would signal that the bakery was open amid chaos. \xe2\x80\x9cWe always wanted to keep something in the windows,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Wardeh said.'b'When refugees arrived from other parts of the country, the couple did their best to feed them. When bullets pierced the windows, Mr. Homsi said, they slept on the floors to stay safe. And when the city became too dangerous, they left Hama, where they had both grown up before they were married, raised four children and started their business.'b'They arrived in the United States last March on permanent resident visas, living at first with one of their sons, a rheumatologist in Albany. They felt safe, but had little to do.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe like to stay busy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Wardeh, 69.'b'Mr. Homsi took walks that lasted many hours. And he baked tray after tray of baklava filled with walnuts. Ms. Wardeh made issheh (sometimes known as ishta) from the skimmed top of heated and cooled milk, a specialty of bakers in Hama. Pressed, it takes on the texture of a tender, fresh cheese.'b'The couple have two sons in the United States and two in the Middle East. Their youngest, Zaher Homsi, who had dropped out of high school to run the family bakery in Hama, was recently approved for refugee processing.'b'He was waiting for a second interview in Abu Dhabi with his wife and child when President Trump signed an 'b'executive order late last month barring immigrants'b' from Syria, along with six other nations. Family members aren\xe2\x80\x99t sure when they\xe2\x80\x99ll be reunited.'b'While they wait for a definitive court ruling on the order, Mr. Homsi focuses on his baklava. He chops the walnuts by hand to maintain their crunch, and seasons them with just a touch of powdered sugar and orange blossom water.'b'He is careful not to let any excess water into the pastry \xe2\x80\x94 this means using clarified butter and carefully airing out each sheet of phyllo before layering it. Or, as Mr. Homsi put it, giving the dough a chance to breathe.'b'Their small, tidy kitchen in Bay Ridge smelled of butter and boiling coffee, and in the pauses of conversation, you could hear the edges of the baklava, sizzling away. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite ready.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt needs more time to get a nice suntan,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Homsi said.'b'Ms. Wardeh laughed, pushed up the sleeves of her leopard-print cardigan and fed her baby granddaughter small bites of issheh from the tips of her fingers.'b'Recipe: 'b''b'Syrian Walnut Baklava'b''b''b'Admitting to a sweet tooth these days seems rather illicit, what with sugar cast in the role of Public Enemy No. 1. But here is my confession: I rarely go a day without a slice or bite or square of something sweet. If it\xe2\x80\x99s not cake, then it\xe2\x80\x99ll be a cookie, a slice of tart topped with fruit or a slab of dark chocolate, a little pop of joy to accompany a short black coffee or a tall cup of green tea.'b'But it\xe2\x80\x99s not the sugar I\xe2\x80\x99m addicted to. Rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s the comfort, surprise and delight that dessert, or any food, can bring, that ideal match of the right dish and the right moment. The reason a colorful, vertiginously tall and booze-filled trifle brings so much joy at the end of a party is not because of the sugar in the list of ingredients. It\xe2\x80\x99s because nothing says \xe2\x80\x9csharing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccelebration\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cta-da!\xe2\x80\x9d quite like it.'b'And so I introduce my new column for The New York Times, which will appear occasionally and is to be filled with all things baked and sweet.'b'My cookbooks have been known so far for their focus on vegetables (in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPlenty More\xe2\x80\x9d), the food of my Middle Eastern childhood (in \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Jerusalem'b'\xe2\x80\x9d) or the food of my restaurants (as with the Ottolenghi and Nopi books). When I started out in the world of cooking, however, I was firmly on the sweet side. I trained in patisserie, and my first job in the kitchen was as a pastry chef. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the first Ottolenghi shop opened that one carrot led to another and I came to focus as much on the savory side of things as I did on the sweet. It was never an either/or, but for a good decade, I was peeling and roasting more than I was beating together butter and sugar, or lining cake tins.'b'Recently, though, my work surfaces have become covered in flour, and my electric mixer has been getting a workout. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been baking, and the kitchen smells good. I always find cooking for people satisfying, but there is something particularly \xe2\x80\x94 and instantly \xe2\x80\x94 rewarding about that moment of bliss that you see when someone bites into something sweet and delicious for the first time. Whether it\xe2\x80\x99s a rich and composed dessert, such as my kataifi nests, or a refreshing and light granita, the world, for that shared moment, is all about a simple and straightforward kind of pleasure.'b'Again, though: It\xe2\x80\x99s not about the sugar. I spend my days cooking and eating a wide range of foods, sweet and savory, Asian or Middle Eastern or Mediterranean in inspiration. Similarly, when I\xe2\x80\x99m baking, I\xe2\x80\x99m just as likely to reach for all sorts of ingredients. The sugar is there, of course, just like the eggs, butter and flour, but the things that really excite me and deliver that pop of joy lie elsewhere. It\xe2\x80\x99s the pinch of golden saffron threads used to poach pears, the cubes of tangy feta whipped through some cream, the use of kataifi pastry (long strands of shredded phyllo) in the place of a more obvious shortbread base. It\xe2\x80\x99s the jewel-like slivered green pistachios that make me smile, and the ruby-red pomegranate seeds.'b'In the columns to come, you will find me using things that are not always so obviously associated with baking. The presence of hard herbs like rosemary, for example, in an orange and olive oil cake. Cookies bound together and enriched by tahini, the use of which tends to be confined, by many, to the making of hummus. Spices will bring flavor, citrus will bring freshness. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll come to share my obsession with lemons, that you\xe2\x80\x99ll indulge my penchant for adding a splash of booze wherever I can. I hope you will agree that, just sometimes, a sprinkle of rose petals really is enough to make the day something special.'b'And so to this week\xe2\x80\x99s recipes! I\xe2\x80\x99m writing and testing my recipes from London, but I first shared these two with an audience at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in November. Laila el-Haddad and Maggie Schmitt, the co-authors of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Gaza Kitchen: A Palestinian Culinary Journey'b',\xe2\x80\x9d joined me in curating two evenings of \xe2\x80\x9cHafla,\xe2\x80\x9d or family-style feasting, for 120 guests who sat side by side at long communal tables. The menu we chose was inspired by an exhibit at the museum at the time, called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Every People Under Heaven'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Spanning the period between 1000 to 1400 in Jerusalem, the exhibition covered a lot of ground. Spanning three courses and 13 dishes, our meal covered a lot of the table.'b'It was quite special to see so many different people share so many different dishes. As food was passed around, conversations were had and stories were told, either about specific dishes \xe2\x80\x94 the marinated sweet-and-sour halibut, for example, with a taste profile much more common in the medieval era than it is today \xe2\x80\x94 or about the significance of particular ingredients in cooking during the period. Sugar, for instance, beyond its obvious use as a way to sweeten dessert, was regarded as an indication of warmth and hospitality. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sweeter the tea, the more generous the host,\xe2\x80\x9d as Laila told our guests. It\xe2\x80\x99s a time-honored practice that, I like to think, continues to this day.'b'I love to cook, I love to bake, I love all sorts of food at all sorts of times. In the spirit of my earlier confession, then, this is going to be my safely sweet space for the time being, the place I\xe2\x80\x99m going to come to with my ideas for all things dessert. I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll want to roll up your sleeves, grab some flour and dust the counter as well.'b'Recipes: 'b''b'Pastry Nests With Poached Pears and Feta and Saffron Cream'b''b' | 'b''b'Pomegranate and Rose Granita'b''b''b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s a plan of action that works for dinner any night of the week: Melt some butter; add in some minced garlic, herbs, spices and a squirt of lemon; then pour it over whatever you have your heart set on eating. With almost no effort, you\xe2\x80\x99ll have a sauce that makes anything taste better.'b'It works on chicken. It works on steak. It even works on all those beets and turnips you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite figure out what to do with.'b'But of all its possible applications, my favorite is to drizzle it on fish fillets before running them under the broiler.'b'The reason this sauce goes so well with fish is that they are so different in nature. Fish fillets are mild and lean. A spiced garlic butter sauce is bold and rich. They round each other out in a wonderful way.'b'Start by choosing a mild white fish fillet, whatever looks good in the market. I gravitate toward blackfish and hake because they\xe2\x80\x99re sustainable and I can usually find them at my local fish store. Hake is the less expensive of the two, but it also has a less refined texture, with big, coarse flakes. It\xe2\x80\x99s delicious, just as long as you don\xe2\x80\x99t overcook it. Flounder is another dependable option.'b'Ten minutes before you want to put dinner on the table, preheat the broiler and start making the sauce.'b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t really even need to follow a recipe for this kind of butter sauce; it\xe2\x80\x99s very forgiving. Melt your butter and stir in as much or as little garlic as you like. (I like a lot.) I also add ginger here for extra intensity, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have any, you can leave it out. Then check the refrigerator and unearth the last sprigs of dill or thyme left over from grander and more complicated cooking projects. Chop them up, add some to the sauce, and save the rest for a bright garnish.'b'As for spices, anything fresh and fragrant in your cabinet is fair game. The curry powder here lends a musky note and a little heat. But cumin, coriander or paprika would also be lovely. Then finish with a squeeze of citrus for tang.'b'It will be one of the quickest and most savory dinners imaginable \xe2\x80\x94 a combination welcome at the table any night of the week.'b'Recipe: 'b''b'Broiled Fish With Lemon Curry Butter'b''b''b''b'And to Drink ...'b''b'The world has become flexible enough to accept red wine with fish, but this recipe definitely calls for a white. Which white depends on the part of the recipe you decide to emphasize. Grated ginger and curry powder are the key variables. Go light on them, and you have a butter, garlic and herb sauce, which will go beautifully with any number of dry whites: Muscadet, Chablis or other white Burgundies, sauvignon blanc, Soave, Etna Bianco or assyrtiko from Santorini. Ramp up the ginger and curry powder, and these wines will still be fine. But even better may be good German rieslings, whether moderately sweet kabinetts and sp\xc3\xa4tleses or dry, steely Rheingaus. Gr\xc3\xbcner veltliner is another option. ERIC ASIMOV'b'Who knew that vegetables would take this long to prepare? After several years of talk and planning, the chef 'b'Jean-Georges Vongerichten'b' is preparing to open his first all-vegetarian restaurant, ABCV, by the end of the month.'b'The third of the Vongerichten restaurants in the ABC Carpet &amp; Home store in the Flatiron district, the restaurant replaces a branch of Le Pain Quotidien. The space is now bright and white, with an open kitchen, dressy chandeliers and, near the entrance, a stretch of bar opposite a sales counter with bowls of food for takeout. Service will begin with breakfast and lunch; dinner, consisting mostly of shared plates, will be added a few weeks later.'b'The chef de cuisine is Neal Harden, who was at Pure Food and Wine on Irving Place. Mr. Harden, 35, has been a vegetarian since he was a teenager. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was because I loved animals,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Mr. Vongerichten said the food at ABCV was \xe2\x80\x9call Neal, but with my touch.\xe2\x80\x9d And the inspiration is certainly global.'b'The day can start with avocado toast, a hemp protein shake, assorted dosas (southern Indian pancakes), steamed tofu with roasted cauliflower and harissa, fried eggs with smoked potatoes and vegetables, and congee, the Cantonese porridge, made with forbidden rice and millet.'b'Lunch offers a verdant kale and avocado sandwich; a deeply flavored mushroom and barley soup; a whole artichoke with Sicilian olive oil and lemon; colorful warm carrots with stone-ground seed and nut butters; and sauerkraut that is unusually light and fresh. \xe2\x80\x9cWe use savoy cabbage, which is more attractive, let it ferment only for two weeks, and add some horseradish and dill,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vongerichten said.'b'What you will not find on the menu are veggie burgers upholstered with nut \xe2\x80\x9ccheese,\xe2\x80\x9d or vegetable protein masquerading as meat. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in doing things like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vongerichten said. \xe2\x80\x9cVegetables can stand on their own.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The kitchen has a wood grill, and on the bar is a Juicero, a machine for making vegetable juices in minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing vegetable juices since Lafayette,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vongerichten said, referring to the opening of his first New York restaurant more than 31 years ago.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a full bar with locally made organic spirits and a list of biodynamic and organic wines. \xe2\x80\x9cPairing wines with this food can be a challenge,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeremy Mustakas, the wine director. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you\xe2\x80\x99d be surprised; you can enjoy a Brunello with the wild mushroom burdock noodles.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The vegetarian restaurant, which uses only organic ingredients (an effort Mr. Vongerichten is making at most of his other restaurants), has been an evolving project: It joins ABC Kitchen, which opened in 2010, and 'b'ABC Cocina'b', which followed three years later. They replaced two restaurants, Lucy and Pipa, owned by Mr. Vongerichten\xe2\x80\x99s business partner, Phil Suarez, and Paulette Cole, the owner of ABC Carpet &amp; Home. In their place, Ms. Cole wanted restaurants that relied more on local produce.'b'Soon after ABC Cocina opened, Mr. Vongerichten began discussing the next step, a vegetarian restaurant, with Ms. Cole, who is a partner in ABCV and the rest of the ABC collection.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cABCV is an offshoot of ABC Kitchen, but more focused,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a game changer for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'ABCV, 38 East 19th Street, 212-475-5829, 'b'abcvnyc.com'b'.'b''b'SAN FRANCISCO \xe2\x80\x94 Five years ago, Dominique Crenn was just another hardworking Bay Area chef running a small, ambitious restaurant. She had been cooking since the early 1990s, when she arrived in this city from her native France, but she was still off the radar for many American food lovers. She had never won a James Beard award or served as a judge on \xe2\x80\x9cTop Chef\xe2\x80\x9d or hit any of the other marks of culinary stardom.'b'But in 2013, 'b'Atelier Crenn'b', her sleek modernist restaurant in Pacific Heights, won two stars from the Michelin Guide, making Ms. Crenn the highest-ranked female chef in the United States \xe2\x80\x94 and drawing the tribe of global gastro-tourists who follow the stars. Last year, she was named \xe2\x80\x9cthe World\xe2\x80\x99s Best Female Chef\xe2\x80\x9d by the 'b'World\xe2\x80\x99s 50 Best'b', a London-based group that publishes an influential (if somewhat arbitrary) annual list of the best restaurants in the world.'b'Since then she has shot video campaigns for 'b'LG refrigerators'b' and 'b'Georg Jensen'b' tableware, been the cover model for the magazine 'b'Gastronomique En Vogue'b', and is profiled in an episode of 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChef\xe2\x80\x99s Table\xe2\x80\x9d'b' on Netflix. She has been honored by the French government for her contributions to gastronomy and culture, delivered a 'b'TED Talk'b' on \xe2\x80\x9cdefining success,\xe2\x80\x9d lectured at Harvard, and spearheaded a movement of chefs to help restore agriculture in Haiti.'b'Her vault to international fame and clout has surprised many American food lovers, who are more familiar with chefs like 'b'Barbara Lynch'b' and 'b'April Bloomfield'b'. And it has raised questions \xe2\x80\x94 some new, some age-old \xe2\x80\x94 about how and why some chefs, and not others, achieve celebrity.'b'Ms. Crenn herself, a little stunned by her whirlwind ascent, is one of the people wrestling hardest with those questions, including what it means to be a leading woman in what remains a male-dominated field.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that award won\xe2\x80\x99t exist in two years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said over coffee (American drip, black) at a hipster bike shop/espresso bar near the restaurant. She considered rejecting the \xe2\x80\x9cBest Female Chef\xe2\x80\x9d title, which many chefs, including her, consider patronizing. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then I thought, \xe2\x80\x98Am I going to fight it or am I going to do something with it?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Crenn is clearly up for the fight, from the soles of her retro-chic Adidas trainers to the tips of her spiky hair. She is thoughtful, outspoken, authoritative and softhearted, sometimes in the course of a single sentence. Unlike many chefs who keep their heads down and their focus on the kitchen, she is not afraid to raise her voice \xe2\x80\x94 about religion, immigration, entitlement, gratitude and other topics only tangentially related to food.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDominique is a force to be reckoned with\xe2\x80\x9d said Melissa Perello, the chef at 'b'Octavia'b' and 'b'Frances'b' here and a longtime friend.'b'As a chef, Ms. Crenn is both the artist who challenges and creates, and the cook who comforts and nourishes. (Her other restaurant, 'b'Petit Crenn'b', is a homage to French home cooking and to Ms. Crenn\xe2\x80\x99s childhood visits to Brittany.)'b'Dinner at the jewel-box-like Atelier Crenn, which opened in 2011, begins not with a menu but with a poem on a slip of paper:'b'At the edge of the winter lake,'b'Come with me and look into the golden light'b'A burst of oceanic feeling, salty black pearls'b'The whimsically ebullient blue umami'b''b''b''b'The poem extends to a dozen lines, each one corresponding to a course: the meal, to more than 30 different bites, each one simultaneously delicious, elaborate and bewildering.'b'On the plate, \xe2\x80\x9cwhimsically ebullient blue umami\xe2\x80\x9d translates to a shellfish course: grilled local abalone garnished with abalone liver, roasted garlic, egg \xe2\x80\x9cjam,\xe2\x80\x9d oyster-scented cream and a tangy gelatinized mignonette sauce.'b'The eminent French chef Guy Savoy described himself as \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately seduced\xe2\x80\x9d by Ms. Crenn\xe2\x80\x99s cooking. \xe2\x80\x9cHer work is so close to and respectful of the product,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen combined with her beautiful sensibility, the result is deeply affecting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, food that is deeply affecting is not always what Americans are comfortable eating. Some critics have called Ms. Crenn\xe2\x80\x99s work mystifying and pretentious, both on the plate and on the page.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cAtelier Crenn: Metamorphosis of Taste,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' her 2015 cookbook, included a multicomponent recipe for \xe2\x80\x9cBirth\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a nest woven from corn silk, dehydrated and deep-fried, filled with tiny eggs made of corn \xe2\x80\x9cmilk,\xe2\x80\x9d duck fat and egg yolks and garnished with dark chocolate twigs.'b'She may be intensely cerebral on the plate, but Ms. Crenn is high-spirited in person. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99d think she would be a bore, but she\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the opposite,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Nancy Silverton'b', a founder of LaBrea Bakery and of the Mozza restaurants in Los Angeles. \xe2\x80\x9cDominique is a very serious chef with a very playful personality.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Crenn, 51, was raised outside Paris, in Versailles. Her father, Allain Crenn, was a politician and a painter, whom she credits with developing the awareness of the visual arts and the natural world that is always present in her work.'b'She learned the principles of cooking from her mother, Louise Crenn, and was taken to fine restaurants from a young age. But she did not dream of becoming a chef, and never attended culinary school. She moved here after graduating from college in Paris, and has never truly left. \xe2\x80\x9cFrance is my country, but San Francisco is my home,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'With only her basic culinary skills, she talked her way into a job at Stars, cooking under 'b'Jeremiah Tower'b', and changed kitchens frequently after that, with a yearlong stint in Indonesia. Along the way, she refined the style and skills that have lifted her to a prominence available to very few women in the profession.'b'She is the only woman named to the international advisory board of the prestigious new 'b'Basque Culinary Center'b', a research and innovation institute in Spain funded by AB InBev, Siemens and other multinational corporations. Other board members include the chefs Ferran Adri\xc3\xa0, Dan Barber, Alex Atala and Massimo Bottura.'b'The restaurant critic for Elite Traveler magazine, Andy Hayler, recently predicted that Ms. Crenn would be the world\xe2\x80\x99s single 'b'most influential chef'b' of the next 10 years, outranking a corps of also-rans, all men, like David Chang and Grant Achatz.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPartly because she is one of the few chefs who can pull off a modernist menu in a way that is interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Hayler said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd partly because she is a woman, and therefore presumably able to influence more women to do what she does.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Crenn now has to wrangle publicly with the increasingly controversial role of leading female chef, a label she has tried to fend off throughout her career. The morning after being named \xe2\x80\x9cBest Female Chef,\xe2\x80\x9d she was on 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cToday\xe2\x80\x9d'b' defending (and explaining) the title, while online a debate raged over whether the award was a gratifying recognition from peers or a blatant expression of the sexism that continues to pervade the restaurant business.'b'Many chefs and journalists contended that the award\xe2\x80\x99s very existence smacked of tokenism, especially when bestowed upon a chef, like Ms. Crenn, whose restaurant has never appeared on the World\xe2\x80\x99s 50 Best list. On Mic, the food journalist Khushbu Shah 'b'wrote'b' that the award \xe2\x80\x9csays you may be the best female chef in the world, but there are still 50 male chefs that are better than you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Because of rankings like World\xe2\x80\x99s 50 Best, in which chefs help decide the winners, success in the modern food world requires being admired by other chefs \xe2\x80\x94 most of them male and European \xe2\x80\x94 even more than by critics. Ms. Crenn is popular among other chefs, who cite her dedication to mentoring, philanthropy and environmental causes, as well as her talent.'b'But her food is unapologetically artsy, personal and sometimes risky, and she believes this is one reason she received less credit and more criticism at the beginning of her solo career.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany people still think a creative, original artist must be a man,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. This was long true in art, fashion, literature and many other fields, she pointed out. \xe2\x80\x9cMy biggest role models are not chefs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut women like Coco Chanel, Simone de Beauvoir, Nina Simone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today, her style of cooking may work in her favor: Ms. Crenn is making the kind of food that currently commands attention from the food media and gastro-tourists. That means using technology to transform familiar foods into exotic forms; deploying luxury ingredients like foie gras, abalone and king crab; experimenting with foraged food like plankton and sea buckthorn; and presenting every dish in a way that is highly 'b'Instagrammable'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe cooks the way the men are cooking,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Bauer, the longtime restaurant critic for The San Francisco Chronicle, said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cLike what you\xe2\x80\x99d see at Benu or Quince or Le Bernardin,\xe2\x80\x9d all restaurants with three Michelin stars, headed by men.'b'Many women can and do cook in this au courant style, loosely called \xe2\x80\x9cmodernist.\xe2\x80\x9d But in the United States, so far, few of them are at the helm of their own restaurants.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDominique is an outstanding chef, very creative and evolutionary,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elena Arzak, the modernist chef of 'b'Arzak'b' in the Basque Country, who began to champion Ms. Crenn\xe2\x80\x99s career more than a decade ago. Ms. Arzak was named the \xe2\x80\x9cBest Female Chef\xe2\x80\x9d of 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cShe is always up-to-date on our world of food, and concerned with the larger world of nature and the environment,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'(In April, Ms, Crenn will pass the \xe2\x80\x9cBest Female Chef\xe2\x80\x9d baton to Ana Ro\xc5\xa1, a former ski champion and self-taught chef whose restaurant in rural Slovenia is dedicated to introducing the world to the native foods of the western Balkans.)'b'Ms. Perello, of Octavia, said most female chefs lack not the ability, but the desire, to embrace modernist cooking. With its manicured compositions and technical transformations, it\xe2\x80\x99s a style that constantly announces the presence of the chef. \xe2\x80\x9cFor whatever reason,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s still easier for men to stick their neck out and say: \xe2\x80\x98Look at me, look at what I\xe2\x80\x99m doing on this plate. Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it incredible?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Clearly, Ms. Crenn\xe2\x80\x99s breakthrough is not only about the food. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Dominique is more enamored of technique and equipment than any of the women chefs I know,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Silverton said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s her charisma and confidence, not her cooking, that cracked that boys\xe2\x80\x99 club open.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bauer, who gave Atelier Crenn three and a half stars in a 2014 review, took that a few steps further. \xe2\x80\x9cShe has been successful because she does have talent, and she has worked hard,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest, also because she has enormous charisma, she\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful, and has that French accent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Crenn shrugs off this assessment. She is firmly feminist, but her interest in identity politics in the kitchen is limited.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBeing a chef is about feeding people, which is part of the story of all humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMale, female, gay, straight, Jewish, Muslim, white, black: The longer I do this, the more I am sure that none of it should matter in the kitchen \xe2\x80\x94 or anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaybe I\xe2\x80\x99ll start my own list,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would not look like anything the world has seen before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Recipe: 'b''b'Caramelized Winter Squash With Pumpkin Seed Persillade'b''b''b'GIRONA, Spain \xe2\x80\x94 After more than 30 years in business, 'b'El Celler de Can Roca'b' has a lot to boast about: three Michelin stars, an attention-grabbing menu that works in contemporary twists on traditional Catalan dishes and a berth atop nearly every list of the world\xe2\x80\x99s best restaurants.'b'It also has a much less publicized distinction \xe2\x80\x94 its own psychologist.'b'Life at the pinnacle of the fiercely competitive fine-dining world can be fraught with anxiety and conflict. So the restaurant hired Imma Puig, who comes weekly to talk with employees and try to defuse emotions at this gastronomic destination 60 miles northeast of Barcelona.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA kitchen has high temperature and a lot of people working at high speed, very close to each other \xe2\x80\x94 and with a knife in their hand,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Puig said. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch a place certainly can create tensions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The tensions are not confined to the kitchen. Sommeliers, waiters, receptionists and others on the 60-member staff have to cater to the requirements of diners who themselves arrive in a state of pent-up expectation: The restaurant has an 11-month waiting list. It seats 55 customers, each of whom pays at least about $190.'b'Ms. Puig, 63, works with groups of employees, from the back of the house to the front, on every aspect of their work except the food. On a recent Tuesday morning, she led a dozen workers in a discussion about the planned remodeling of their changing rooms.'b'Ms. Puig asked them what they wanted from the rooms. Did they need privacy when looking into the mirror? Should a special area be allocated for makeup?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really been thinking about this, but the changing room sets the mood for how you start your working day,\xe2\x80\x9d Nacho Baucells, the chef de cuisine, said after the session. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd everybody has views on what makes them feel comfortable or not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Puig then debriefed the staff on a recent trip to Houston, where Joan Roca, the executive chef and the eldest of the three brothers who own the restaurant, traveled with eight members of his kitchen staff to prepare two special dinners before the Super Bowl. Ms. Puig asked if anyone felt left behind. Some hoped to join the next trip, but nobody sounded too disappointed. One cook said he had enjoyed the increased responsibility of working without the help of his out-of-town colleagues.'b'Ms. Puig runs her therapy session with a different group each week, often mixing cooks and waiters to help break down divisions between the kitchen and dining room.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOutside of these meetings, we don\xe2\x80\x99t really talk about our problems with those in the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eric Oliu, the ma\xc3\xaetre d\xe2\x80\x99h\xc3\xb4tel, who added that he valued the sessions as an opportunity to discuss the underestimated challenges facing his own staff members, who are more exposed to the whims of the clientele.'b'In the world of haute cuisine, he said, \xe2\x80\x9ceverybody now wants to become a chef, but nobody wants to be a waiter, so working in the dining room means that you\xe2\x80\x99d better get used to staying in the shadows.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Oliu said Ms. Puig had helped broker an agreement about when waiters could return plates to the kitchen without upsetting the staff there, who work with clockwork precision. \xe2\x80\x9cIf people go out to smoke or a couple starts arguing at the table, you have to stop things because the couple is then not even looking at their food and letting it get cold,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kitchen has its own tensions and pace, but we are the ones looking after the clients.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Roca said he was unaware of any other restaurant using a psychologist but predicted that others would follow suit.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe all have to move on from a time when the kitchen was about pure discipline and toughness, sometimes almost bordering on mistreatment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re all obsessed about anything going wrong with our kitchen equipment, but somehow don\xe2\x80\x99t always pay so much attention to the human machinery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That human machinery can break down in dramatic fashion. Last year, the chef 'b'Beno\xc3\xaet Violier'b''b' committed suicide'b' shortly after his establishment in Switzerland, the Restaurant de l\xe2\x80\x99H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville, was named the world\xe2\x80\x99s best in 'b'La L'b''b'iste'b', which is based on a compilation of hundreds of guidebook reviews. In 2015, another young star chef, Homaro Cantu, 'b'hanged himself'b' in Chicago.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a very competitive world in which you have to find the tools not only to be successful, but then to manage that success,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Roca said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the client perceives is a chain reaction of strong emotions that reach his table but go back not only to the kitchen but also to the relationship with the small food supplier.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Puig believes those emotions can even affect the food. \xe2\x80\x9cA dish that has been cooked under tension and in a bad mood will certainly taste different,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'She draws on the teachings of Michael Balint, a Hungarian psychoanalyst who developed his own approach to psychology after World War II, when he worked in an English hospital where he noticed the negative and impersonal relationships between doctors and patients.'b'Ms. Puig has also been a professor of human resources at one of Spain\xe2\x80\x99s top business schools, 'b'Esade'b', and has worked with some leading corporations. But she mostly made her mark as a sports psychologist, first with tennis players, then as the psychologist for the soccer team F.C. Barcelona.'b'Her foray into gastronomy grew out of her fondness for El Celler\xe2\x80\x99s food. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce after eating in the restaurant, I just asked to see what happened in the kitchen,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled.'b'Since that inspection three years ago, she has been visiting on Tuesdays, when the restaurant opens only for dinner. Some of her sessions are with just the Roca siblings.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis restaurant is also about managing well a family business,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'
