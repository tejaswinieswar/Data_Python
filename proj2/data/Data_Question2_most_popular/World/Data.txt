b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 Swedes reacted with confusion, anger and ridicule on Sunday to a vague remark by President Trump that suggested that something terrible had occurred in their country.'b'During a 'b'campaign-style rally'b' on Saturday in Florida, Mr. Trump issued a sharp if discursive attack on refugee policies in Europe, ticking off a list of places that have been hit by terrorists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening,\xe2\x80\x9d he told his supporters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Germany, you look at what\xe2\x80\x99s happening last night in 'b'Sweden'b'. Sweden, who would believe this?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not the Swedes.'b'Nothing particularly nefarious happened in Sweden on Friday \xe2\x80\x94 or Saturday, for that matter \xe2\x80\x94 and Swedes were left baffled.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound,\xe2\x80\x9d Carl Bildt, a former prime minister and foreign minister, 'b'wrote on Twitter'b'.'b'As the Swedish newspaper 'b'Aftonbladet'b' noted, Twitter users were quick to ridicule Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remark, with joking references to the Swedish Chef, the \xe2\x80\x9cMuppets\xe2\x80\x9d character; Swedish meatballs; and Ikea, the furniture giant.'b'Mr. Trump did not state, per se, that a terrorist attack had taken place in Sweden. But the context of his remarks \xe2\x80\x94 he mentioned Sweden right after he chastised Germany, a destination for refugees and asylum seekers fleeing war and deprivation \xe2\x80\x94 suggested that he thought it might have.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSweden,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey took in large numbers. They\xe2\x80\x99re having problems like they never thought possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He then invoked the terrorist attacks that took place in Paris in 2015 and in Brussels and Nice, France, last year, to make an argument for tightening scrutiny of travelers and asylum seekers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed thousands and thousands of people into our country, and there was no way to vet those people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was no documentation. There was no nothing. So we\xe2\x80\x99re going to keep our country safe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a White House spokeswoman, tried to clarify the president\xe2\x80\x99s remarks Sunday, saying Mr. Trump did not mean to suggest that a particular attack had happened the night before, but rather was talking about crime in general in Sweden.'b'On Sunday, Mr. Trump offered 'b'his own clarification'b', writing on Twitter, \xe2\x80\x9cMy statement as to what\xe2\x80\x99s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants &amp; Sweden.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In that story, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson 'b'interviewed'b''b' Ami Horowitz'b', a filmmaker who asserts that migrants in Sweden have been associated with a crime wave. \xe2\x80\x9cThey oftentimes try to cover up some of these crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Horowitz said, arguing that those who try to tell the truth about the situation are shouted down as racists and xenophobes.'b'(Mr. Carlson interjected, \xe2\x80\x9cThe masochism of the West knows no bounds at all.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Mr. Horowitz said, \xe2\x80\x9cSweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they\xe2\x80\x99re now getting a taste of what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been seeing across Europe already.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was not clear what he was referring to. In 2010, a suicide bomber 'b'struck central Stockholm'b', injuring two people. The 'b'bomber'b', Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly, 28, was an Iraqi-born Swede who had developed an affinity for Al Qaeda. But that attack occurred long before the current wave of migrants.'b'Sweden has a long history of welcoming refugees \xe2\x80\x94 Jews, Iranians, Eritreans, Somalis, Kurds and people from the former Yugoslavia, among others \xe2\x80\x94 but even some of the most tolerant and idealistic Swedes have 'b'raised questions'b' about whether the country can absorb so many newcomers so quickly.'b'Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the 'b'Swedish Institute'b', a state agency dedicated to promoting Sweden globally, said he was puzzled by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s remarks.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not have a clue what he was referring to,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cObviously, this could be connected to the fact that there has been a lot of negative reporting about Sweden, since Sweden has taken in a lot of refugees.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The country processed 81,000 asylum seekers in 2014, 163,000 in 2015 and 29,000 last year, with another 25,000 to 45,000 expected this year, according to the Swedish Migration Agency.'b'Mr. Selin completed a study recently focusing on negative news reports about Sweden\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of refugees. It found numerous exaggerations and distortions, including false reports that 'b'Shariah law'b' was predominant in parts of the country and that some immigrant-heavy neighborhoods were considered \xe2\x80\x9cno-go zones\xe2\x80\x9d by the police.'b'Breitbart News, the right-wing website once led by Stephen K. Bannon, now Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s senior strategist, has published numerous stories alleging that migrants have been responsible for a surge in crime and for a wave of sexual assaults. Swedish officials have said that their statistics do not justify such sweeping assertions, and that the country has a high number of sexual assault reports relative to other European countries 'b'because more victims come forward'b', not because there is more violence.'b'Mr. Selin said the news reports \xe2\x80\x9cwere highly exaggerated and not based in facts,\xe2\x80\x9d adding, \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the stories were very popular to spread in social media by people who have the same kind of agenda \xe2\x80\x94 that countries should not receive so many refugees.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As for the cover-up alleged by Mr. Horowitz, Mr. Selin said: \xe2\x80\x9cThat kind of claim has been in the political debate for 15 years now. But nobody has been able to prove there is a cover-up. On the contrary, the fact is that crime rates are going down.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cSwedish authorities have nothing to gain from hiding the truth. We are quite keen to ensure that the debate and the story about our country is fact-based and nuanced. We are more than happy to talk about the challenges our country faces as well as the things that are going well.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Asked about Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s comment, 'b'Anna Kinberg Batra'b', the leader of the opposition Moderate Party, said in a statement, \xe2\x80\x9cPresident Trump has to answer himself for his statements, why he makes them and based on what facts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Foreign Minister 'b'Margot Wallstrom'b' declined to comment because, her press secretary, 'b'Erik Wirkensjo'b', said, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say what Trump is talking about.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an essay in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, the journalist Martin Gelin speculated that \xe2\x80\x9cTrump might have gotten his news from the countless right-wing media in the United States that have long been reporting that Sweden is heading for total collapse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added, \xe2\x80\x9cAmong Trump supporters, there are common myths that Sweden is in a state of chaos after taking in refugees from the Middle East.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'ROME \xe2\x80\x94 When Stephen K. Bannon was still heading Breitbart News, he went to the 'b'Vatican'b' to cover the canonization of John Paul II and make some friends. High on his list of people to meet was an archconservative American cardinal, Raymond Burke, who had openly clashed with 'b'Pope Francis'b'.'b'In one of the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s antechambers, amid religious statues and book-lined walls, Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon \xe2\x80\x94 who is now President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s anti-establishment eminence \xe2\x80\x94 bonded over their shared worldview. They saw Islam as threatening to overrun a prostrate West weakened by the erosion of traditional Christian values, and viewed themselves as unjustly ostracized by out-of-touch political elites.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you recognize someone who has sacrificed in order to remain true to his principles and who is fighting the same kind of battles in the cultural arena, in a different section of the battlefield, I\xe2\x80\x99m not surprised there is a meeting of hearts,\xe2\x80\x9d said Benjamin Harnwell, a confidant of Cardinal Burke who arranged the 2014 meeting.'b'While Mr. Trump, a twice-divorced president who has boasted of groping women, may seem an unlikely ally of traditionalists in the Vatican, many of them regard his election and the ascendance of Mr. Bannon as potentially game-changing breakthroughs.'b'Just as Mr. Bannon has connected with far-right parties threatening to topple governments throughout Western Europe, he has also made common cause with elements in the Roman Catholic Church who oppose the direction Francis is taking them. Many share Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s suspicion of Pope Francis as a dangerously misguided, and probably socialist, pontiff.'b'Until now, Francis has marginalized or demoted the traditionalists, notably Cardinal Burke, carrying out an inclusive agenda on migration, climate change and poverty that has made the pope a figure of unmatched global popularity, especially among liberals. Yet in a newly turbulent world, Francis is suddenly a lonelier figure. Where once Francis had a powerful ally in the White House in Barack Obama, now there is Mr. Trump and Mr. Bannon, this new president\xe2\x80\x99s ideological guru.'b'For many of the pope\xe2\x80\x99s ideological opponents in and around the Vatican, who are fearful of a pontiff they consider outwardly avuncular but internally a ruthless wielder of absolute political power, this angry moment in history is an opportunity to derail what they see as a disastrous papal agenda. And in Mr. Trump, and more directly in Mr. Bannon, some self-described \xe2\x80\x9cRad Trads\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 or radical traditionalists \xe2\x80\x94 see an alternate leader who will stand up for traditional Christian values and against Muslim interlopers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are huge areas where we and the pope do overlap, and as a loyal Catholic, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to spend my life fighting against the pope on issues where I won\xe2\x80\x99t change his mind,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Harnwell said over a lunch of cannelloni. \xe2\x80\x9cFar more valuable for me would be spend time working constructively with Steve Bannon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He made it clear he was speaking for himself, not for the 'b'Institute for Human Dignity'b', a conservative Catholic group that he founded, and insisted that he shared the pope\xe2\x80\x99s goals of ensuring peace and ending poverty, just not his ideas on how to achieve it.'b'Mr. Bannon publicly articulated his worldview in remarks a few months after his meeting with Cardinal Burke, at a Vatican conference organized by Mr. Harnwell\xe2\x80\x99s institute.'b'Speaking via video feed from Los Angeles, Mr. Bannon, a Catholic, 'b'held forth'b' against rampant secularization, the existential threat of Islam, and a capitalism that had drifted from the moral foundations of Christianity.'b'That talk has garnered much attention, and approval by conservatives, for its explicit expression of Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s vision. Less widely known are his efforts to cultivate strategic alliances with those in Rome who share his interpretation of a right-wing \xe2\x80\x9c'b'church militant'b'\xe2\x80\x9d theology.'b'Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s visage, speeches and endorsement of Mr. Harnwell as \xe2\x80\x9cthe smartest guy in Rome\xe2\x80\x9d are featured heavily on the website of Mr. Harnwell\xe2\x80\x99s foundation. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s senior adviser has maintained email contact with Cardinal Burke, according to Mr. Harnwell, who dropped by the cardinal\xe2\x80\x99s residence after lunch. And another person with knowledge of Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s current outreach said the White House official is personally calling his contacts in Rome for thoughts on who should be the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the Holy See.'b'During Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s April 2014 trip he courted Edward Pentin, a leading conservative Vatican reporter, as a potential correspondent in Rome for Breitbart, the website that is popular with the alt-right, a far-right movement that has attracted white supremacists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe really seemed to get the battles the church needs to fight,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Pentin, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Rigging of a Vatican Synod?\xe2\x80\x9d a book asserting that Pope Francis and his supporters railroaded opponents. Chief among those battles, Mr. Pentin said, was Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s focus on countering a \xe2\x80\x9ccultural Marxism\xe2\x80\x9d that had seeped into the church.'b'Since that visit and the meeting with Cardinal Burke \xe2\x80\x94 an experience that Daniel Fluette, the head of production for Breitbart, described as \xe2\x80\x9cincredibly powerful\xe2\x80\x9d for Mr. Bannon \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ideological strategist has maintained a focus on Rome.'b'Mr. Bannon returned to direct the documentary \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Torchbearer'b',\xe2\x80\x9d in which the \xe2\x80\x9cDuck Dynasty\xe2\x80\x9d star Phil Robertson contemplates the apocalyptic consequences of an eroding Christendom. Mr. Bannon also reunited with old friends, including 'b'Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s eventual Rome correspondent, Thomas Williams'b'.'b'A former priest, Mr. Williams said that he used to have arguments with Mr. Bannon about whether the pope subscribed to a hard-left brand of liberation theology, with Mr. Bannon calling the pope a \xe2\x80\x9csocialist/communist.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Williams said he usually defended the pope, but that recent statements by Francis convinced him \xe2\x80\x9cSteve turned out to be right. That happens more often than not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s private thoughts about the pope have at times surfaced in public.'b'On May 23, Mr. Bannon and Mr. Williams spoke about Pope Francis on the radio program Breitbart News Daily.'b'Discussing a Breitbart article about the new mayor of London titled \xe2\x80\x9cPope Hails Election of Sadiq Khan, Celebrates Mass Muslim Migration Into Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Bannon suggested that the pope \xe2\x80\x9cseems almost to be putting the responsibility on the working men and women of Italy and Europe et cetera, that they have to go out of their way to accommodate\xe2\x80\x9d migration.'b'Was the pope a global elitist, Mr. Bannon asked, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo or three steps removed from this?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many critics of Francis express similar views, but they are often scared to express it for fear of retribution from the pope, who, they say, has eyes and ears all over the Vatican.'b'Instead, the pope\xe2\x80\x99s critics anonymously papered Rome over the weekend with posters of a grumpy-looking Francis above complaints about his removing and ignoring clerics and cardinals. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere\xe2\x80\x99s your mercy?\xe2\x80\x9d it asked.'b'Conservatives and traditionalists in the Vatican secretly pass around phony mock-ups of the Vatican\xe2\x80\x99s official paper, L\xe2\x80\x99Osservatore Romano, making fun of the pope. Or they spread a YouTube video critiquing the pope and his exhortation on love in the family, \xe2\x80\x9cAmoris Laetitia,\xe2\x80\x9d which many traditionalists consider Francis\xe2\x80\x99 opening salvo against the doctrine of the church. Set to the music of \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Amore,\xe2\x80\x9d an aggrieved crooner sings, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen will we all be freed from this cruel tyranny, that\xe2\x80\x99s Amoris\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the climate of fear engineered for four years, that\xe2\x80\x99s Amoris.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cardinal Burke \xe2\x80\x94 who has said that the pope\xe2\x80\x99s exhortation, which opened the door for divorced Catholics remarried outside the church to receive communion, might require 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ca formal act of correction\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x94 has been unusually outspoken in his criticism of Francis. Cardinal Burke and Mr. Bannon declined to comment for this article.'b'Just weeks ago, the pope stripped Cardinal Burke of his remaining institutional influence after a 'b'scandal exploded at the Knights of Malta'b', a nearly 1,000-year-old chivalrous order where he had been exiled as a liaison to the Vatican. The pope had removed the order\xe2\x80\x99s grand master after he showed disobedience to the pope. There was a sense in the order that the grand master followed the lead of Cardinal Burke because he projected authority, a power that stemmed in part from his support by the Trump administration, one influential knight said.'b'Cardinal Burke has become a champion to conservatives in the United States. Under Mr. Bannon, Breitbart News urged its Rome correspondent to write sympathetically about him. And at a meeting before last month\xe2\x80\x99s anti-abortion March for Life rally in Washington, Cardinal Burke received the Law of Life Achievement, or Nail award, a framed replica of the nail used to hold the feet of Christ to the cross. According to John-Henry Westen, the editor of 'b'Life Site News'b', who announced the award, the prize is awarded to Christians \xe2\x80\x9cwho have received a stab in the back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Despite Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s inroads in Rome, Mr. Burke and other traditionalists are not ascendant in the Vatican.'b'The Rev. Antonio Spadaro, a Jesuit priest who edits the Vatican-approved journal La Civilta Cattolica and who is close to the pope, dismissed their criticism as the stuff of a noisy but small \xe2\x80\x9cecho chamber.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also played down the effect of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ascent on the standing of Francis\xe2\x80\x99 opponents in the Vatican, saying it was only on a \xe2\x80\x9clevel of image\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpropaganda.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The pope will maintain his direction and not be distracted by fights against those trying to undercut him, Father Spadaro said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe moves forward, and he moves ahead very fast.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added that Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ban on immigrants from certain Muslim countries was \xe2\x80\x9copposite\xe2\x80\x9d to the pontiff\xe2\x80\x99s vision for how to foster unity and peace. The pope, Father Spadaro said, is doing everything he can to avoid the clash of civilizations that both fundamentalist Muslims and Christians want.'b'Indeed, the pope does not seem to be slowing down.'b'Days after the election of Mr. Trump, in St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Basilica, the Vatican officially elevated new cardinals selected by Pope Francis who reflected the pope\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on an inclusive church \xe2\x80\x94 far from the worldview of Mr. Bannon and Mr. Burke.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not that he is just bringing new people in that think maybe like him,\xe2\x80\x9d Cardinal Blase Cupich, the influential new cardinal of Chicago, said after the ceremony. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is transforming the church in making us rethink how we have done things before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That transformation was evident later in the evening, when the old conservative guard came to pay their respects to the new cardinals.'b'Jo\xc3\xa3o Braz de Aviz, a powerful cardinal close to the pope, walked around in simple cleric clothes, the equivalent of civilian dress among all the flowing cassocks. Asked whether the ascent of Mr. Trump would embolden Mr. Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s allies in the Vatican to intensify their opposition and force the pope to take a more orthodox line, he shrugged.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctrine is secure,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that the mission of the church was more to safeguard the poor. It was also, he reminded his traditionalist colleagues, to serve St. Peter, whose authority is passed down through the popes. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd today, Francis is Peter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'NEW DELHI \xe2\x80\x94 Three years ago, Dr. Rajesh Yadav, an investigator with the India Epidemic Intelligence Service, moved to the city of Muzaffarpur, the site of one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'most mysterious outbreaks'b'. And he waited.'b'Every year in mid-May, as temperatures reached scorching heights, parents took children who had been healthy the night before to the hospital. The children awakened with a high-pitch cry in the early morning, many parents said.'b'Then the youths began having 'b'seizures'b' and slipping into comas. In about 40 percent of cases, they died.'b'Every year in July, with the arrival of monsoon rains, the outbreak ended as suddenly as it began.'b'Beginning in 1995, investigations variously ascribed the phenomenon to heat stroke; to infections carried by rats, bats or sand flies; or to 'b'pesticides'b' used in the region\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous lychee orchards. But there were few signposts for investigators.'b'Instead of occurring in clusters, the illness typically struck only one child in a village, often leaving even siblings unaffected.'b'A joint investigation by India\xe2\x80\x99s National Center for Disease Control and the India office of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, 'b'published 'b''b' in the British medical journal The Lancet Global Health'b' on Tuesday, has identified a surprising culprit: the lychee fruit itself, when eaten on an empty stomach by malnourished children.'b'In 2015, as a 'b'result of the investigation'b', health officials began urging parents in the area to be sure to feed young children an evening meal and to limit their consumption of lychees (sometimes spelled litchi).'b'In two seasons, the number of reported cases per year dropped to less than 50 from hundreds.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an unexplained illness for so many years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Padmini Srikantiah, a senior epidemiologist with the C.D.C. and the senior author of the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is kind of emblematic of why we collaborate, to build this kind of systematic approach.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Lancet article walks through a two-year medical detective story, as epidemiologists like Dr. Yadav closely examined the lives of hundreds of afflicted children, trying to understand everything they had eaten, drunk and breathed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a very intense situation, because we witnessed children dying in front of our eyes every day, as soon as they arrived at the hospital,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Yadav, who now works with the C.D.C. in Atlanta. Especially difficult were the detailed interviews of parents, many of whom had carried a convulsing or comatose child for hours to get to the hospital.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey were in a kind of panic,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTheir children were dying, and it was an unknown thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The first clue: There was no evidence the children had infections. 'b''b'For 20 years, clinicians were unable to determine if the disease, which led to acute brain swelling known as 'b'encephalopathy'b', was caused by an infection \xe2\x80\x94 the immediate assumption in many outbreaks here.'b'Investigators pored over records from the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s outbreak and were struck by the fact that many of the sick children did not have a 'b'fever'b'. Analysis of spinal fluid samples overwhelmingly showed that the affected children did not have elevated counts of white blood cells, a sign the body is fighting infection.'b''b'The second clue: Most of the victims had very 'b'low blood sugar levels'b'. 'b''b'Having collected biological samples from more than 300 children, the researchers were able to scan a large number of markers \xe2\x80\x94 including some they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t suspected.'b'Glucose had never been a particular concern for investigators. But some of the affected children had strikingly low levels, and those with low blood glucose were twice as likely to die, Dr. Srikantiah said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt seemed to be a little signal,\xe2\x80\x9d she continued. \xe2\x80\x9cOne of the things we heard multiple times from the children\xe2\x80\x99s mothers was that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t really eat dinner properly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The third clue: Outbreaks had been associated with the ackee fruit. 'b''b'It was in the fall of 2013, during a conference call with colleagues in Atlanta, that someone mentioned \xe2\x80\x9cJamaican 'b'vomiting'b' sickness,\xe2\x80\x9d an outbreak in the West Indies that for many decades caused brain swelling, 'b'convulsions'b' and altered mental states in children.'b'The outbreak turned out to be tied to hypoglycin, a toxin found in the ackee fruit that inhibits the body\xe2\x80\x99s ability to synthesize glucose, leading to acute 'b'hypoglycemia'b', or low blood glucose levels. \xe2\x80\x9cIt had been going on for a decade, if not a century, before people really figured out what it was,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Srikantiah said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, the grandmothers and the mothers teach their kids, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t eat the unripe ackee fruit.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'By late 2014, laboratory tests confirmed that lychees also contain high levels of hypoglycin, as well as a similar toxin known as methylenecyclopropyl glycine, or MCPG.'b'This was an answer hiding in plain sight. The Muzaffarpur area, in India\xe2\x80\x99s east, produces about 70 percent of India\xe2\x80\x99s lychee harvest, and around the affected villages, \xe2\x80\x9cyou really couldn\xe2\x80\x99t go 100 meters without bumping into a lychee orchard,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Srikantiah said, referring to a distance of 330 feet.'b'Though orchards were typically guarded by caretakers, children often ate lychees that were unripe or that had fallen to the ground. But because everyone in the region eats them, it was difficult for many to believe that, in isolated cases, it could set off a catastrophic illness.'b''b'The fourth clue: Affected children had huge metabolic imbalances.'b''b'By early 2015, C.D.C. laboratories had developed a test to measure hypoglycin in urine. They found extraordinary abnormalities in the affected children. \xe2\x80\x9cThe folks in the genetic labs said \xe2\x80\x98We haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything like this,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Srikantiah said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was clearly abnormal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With that established, the investigators asked participants if they would be comfortable issuing recommendations based on their findings: that young children in the affected areas be encouraged to always eat an evening meal, and that consumption of lychees should be limited.'b'Everyone agreed. And it was done.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Trump, after promising a radical break with the foreign policy of 'b'Barack Obama'b', is embracing some key pillars of the former administration\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, including warning 'b'Israel'b' to curb settlement construction, demanding that 'b'Russia'b' withdraw from Crimea and threatening 'b'Iran'b' with sanctions for ballistic missile tests.'b'In the most startling shift, the White House issued an unexpected statement appealing to the Israeli government not to expand the construction of Jewish settlements beyond their current borders in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. Such expansion, it said, \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be helpful in achieving\xe2\x80\x9d the goal of peace.'b'At the United Nations, Ambassador Nikki R. Haley declared that the United States would not lift sanctions against Russia until it stopped destabilizing Ukraine and pulled troops out of Crimea.'b'On Iran, the administration is preparing economic sanctions similar to those the Obama administration imposed just over a year ago. The White House has also shown no indication that it plans to rip up Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s landmark nuclear deal, despite Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s withering criticism of it during the presidential campaign.'b'New administrations often fail to change the foreign policies of their predecessors as radically as they promised, in large part because statecraft is so different from campaigning. And of course, today\xe2\x80\x99s positions could shift over time. There is no doubt the Trump administration has staked out new ground on trade and immigration, upending relations with Mexico and large parts of the Muslim world in the process.'b'But the administration\xe2\x80\x99s reversals were particularly stark because they came after days of tempestuous phone calls between Mr. Trump and foreign leaders, in which he gleefully challenged diplomatic orthodoxy and appeared to jeopardize one relationship after another.'b'Mr. Trump made warmer relations with Russia the centerpiece of his foreign policy during the campaign, and European leaders had been steeling for him to lift sanctions they and Mr. Obama imposed on President Vladimir V. Putin after he annexed Crimea. But on Thursday, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s United Nations ambassador, Ms. Haley, sounded a lot like her predecessor, Samantha Power.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe do want to better our relations with Russia,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in her first remarks to an open session of the United Nations Security Council. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the dire situation in eastern Ukraine is one that demands clear and strong condemnation of Russian actions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Similarly, Mr. Trump presented himself during the campaign as a stalwart supporter of Israel and 'b'criticized'b' the Obama administration for 'b'allowing the passage of a Security Council resolution'b' in December that condemned Israel for its expansion of settlements.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile we don\xe2\x80\x99t believe the existence of settlements is an impediment to peace,\xe2\x80\x9d his press secretary, Sean Spicer, said in a statement, \xe2\x80\x9cthe construction of new settlements or the expansion of existing settlements beyond their current borders may not be helpful in achieving that goal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The White House noted that the president \xe2\x80\x9chas not taken an official position on settlement activity.\xe2\x80\x9d It said he would discuss the issue with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel when they meet Feb. 15, in effect telling Mr. Netanyahu to wait until then. Emboldened by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s support, Israel 'b'has announced'b' more than 5,000 new homes in the West Bank since his inauguration.'b'Mr. Trump shifted his policy after he met briefly with King Abdullah II of Jordan on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast \xe2\x80\x94 an encounter that put the king, one of the most respected leaders of the Arab world, ahead of Mr. Netanyahu in seeing the new president. Jordan, with its large 'b'Palestinian'b' population, has been steadfastly critical of settlements.'b'The administration\xe2\x80\x99s abrupt turnaround also coincided with Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson\xe2\x80\x99s first day at the State Department and the arrival of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in South Korea 'b'on his first official trip'b'. Both men are viewed as potentially capable of exerting a moderating influence on the president and his cadre of White House advisers, though it was unclear how much they had to do with the shifts.'b'With Iran, Mr. Trump has indisputably taken a harder line than his predecessor. While the Obama administration often looked for ways to avoid confrontation with Iran in its last year, Mr. Trump seems equally eager to challenge what he has said is an Iranian expansion across the region, especially in Iraq and Yemen.'b'In an early morning Twitter post on Thursday, Mr. Trump was bombastic on Iran. \xe2\x80\x9cIran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cShould have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!\xe2\x80\x9d In a second post, he said wrongly, \xe2\x80\x9cIran was on its last legs and ready to collapse until the U.S. came along and gave it a life-line in the form of the Iran Deal: $150 billion.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, the administration has been careful not to specify what the national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, meant when he said on Wednesday that Iran had been put \xe2\x80\x9con notice\xe2\x80\x9d for its missile test and for its arming and training of the Houthi rebels in Yemen.'b'The new sanctions could be announced as soon as Friday. But most experts have said they will have little practical effect, because the companies that supply missile parts rarely have direct business with the United States, and allies have usually been reluctant to reimpose sanctions after many were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear accord.'b'Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Iran\xe2\x80\x99s supreme leader, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the first time that an inexperienced person has threatened Iran,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the semiofficial Fars news agency. \xe2\x80\x9cThe American government will understand that threatening Iran is useless.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some analysts said they worried that the administration did not have tools, short of military action, to back up its warning.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhether the Trump administration intended it or not, they have created their own red line,\xe2\x80\x9d said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Iran tests again, the administration will have no choice but to put up or shut up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Netanyahu will cheer Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tough tone with Iran. But the statement on settlements may force him to change course on a delicate domestic issue. His coalition government seemed to take Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration as a starting gun in a race to increase construction in occupied territory.'b'After Mr. Trump was sworn in, Israel announced that it would authorize another 2,500 homes in areas already settled in the West Bank, and then followed that this week by announcing 3,000 more. On Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu took it a step further, vowing to build the first new settlement in the West Bank in many years.'b'For Mr. Netanyahu, the settlement spree reflects a sense of liberation after years of constraints from Washington, especially under Mr. Obama, who, like other presidents, viewed settlement construction as an impediment to negotiating a final peace settlement. It is also an effort to deflect criticism from Israel\xe2\x80\x99s political right for Mr. Netanyahu\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with a court order to 'b'force several dozen families'b' out of an illegal West Bank outpost, Amona.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond their current borders\xe2\x80\x9d phrase in the White House statement hinted at a return to a policy President George W. Bush outlined to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in 2004, which acknowledged that it was unrealistic to expect Israel to give up its major settlements in a final deal, although they would be offset by mutually agreed-upon land swaps.'b'Mr. Trump had also promised 'b'to move the American 'b''b'Embassy'b' from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. But the White House has slowed down the move, in part out of fear of a violent response.'b'The policy shifts came after a turbulent week in which Mr. Trump also clashed with 'b'the leaders of Australia'b' and 'b'Mexico'b' over one of the most fraught issues of his new presidency: immigration. He defended the tense exchanges as an overdue display of toughness by a United States that has been exploited \xe2\x80\x9cby every nation in the world, virtually.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re tough; we have to be tough. It\xe2\x80\x99s time we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be a little tough, folks,\xe2\x80\x9d he said at the prayer breakfast Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet later in the day, the White House felt obliged to put a more diplomatic gloss on events. Mr. Spicer said 'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s call'b' with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia had been \xe2\x80\x9cvery cordial,\xe2\x80\x9d even if Mr. Trump bitterly opposed an agreement negotiated by the Obama administration for the United States to accept the transfer of 1,250 refugees from an Australian detention camp.'b'A senior administration official disputed a report that Mr. Trump had threatened to send troops to Mexico to deal with its \xe2\x80\x9cbad hombres.\xe2\x80\x9d The official said that the conversation with President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto had been \xe2\x80\x9cactually very friendly,\xe2\x80\x9d and that Mr. Trump had been speaking in jest.'b'A local official in 'b'Sweden'b' has a novel proposal to improve work-life balance and lift the local birthrate: give municipal employees an hourlong paid break each week to go home and have sex.'b'Sweden is already celebrated for its 'b'generous welfare state'b', including 'b'480 days of paid parental leave'b', universal health care and a common ritual of coffee and pastry, known as 'b'fika'b', which is considered sacrosanct.'b''b'Per-Erik Muskos,'b' a 42-year-old councilman from the northern town of Overtornea, wants to add to those benefits, by offering the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s 550 employees the right to subsidized sex. In introducing his proposal this week, he told fellow members of the town council that it would give a nudge to the dwindling local population, add spice to aging marriages and improve employee morale.'b'The idea quickly got attention all over Sweden, where for at least some, it was a welcome distraction from President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'vague reference to problems'b' the country was having with immigration, which were strongly denied by baffled Swedes.'b'Noting that \xe2\x80\x9csex is also a great form of exercise and has documented positive effects on well-being,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Muskos suggested that local municipal employees could use an hour of the workweek already allotted for fitness activities to go home and have sex with their spouses or partners instead. The motion, which is expected to be voted on in the spring, needs a simple majority to be passed by the 31-member council. As of now, opinion on the council is divided.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe should encourage procreation. I believe that sex is often in short supply. Everyday life is stressful and the children are at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Muskos explained in his motion in 'b'Overtornea,'b' a 'b' town'b' of about 4,500 in the picturesque and remote Torne Valley. \xe2\x80\x9cThis could be an opportunity for couples to have their own time, only for each other.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His proposal has generated praise, ridicule and criticism. Some critics fear single workers could while away their working hours on the 'b'dating app 'b''b'Tinder'b' trying to find a date for their weekly interlude.'b'When Mr. Muskos introduced the motion on Monday, some council members giggled while others said they were not amused. But befitting a progressive country which has long been perceived as a beacon of sexual enlightenment \xe2\x80\x94 including blissfully kitsch performances at the 'b'Eurovision'b' Song Contest \xe2\x80\x94 the proposal was taken in stride.'b'It made 'b'headlines'b' across Sweden and beyond. \xe2\x80\x9cSuggestion: Let the staff have sex during working hours,\xe2\x80\x9d a headline in the newspaper 'b'Expressen'b' declared, under a photograph showing a couple in bed.'b'Mr. Muskos told colleagues the proposal was no joke, though he acknowledged practical problems like enforcement. It would be difficult to tell, for example, if an employee eschewed sex in favor of a walk in the country.'b'The proposal comes as countries across Europe are grappling with how to balance the rigors of modernity and work with the desire for better quality of life. In France, which already has a mandatory 35-hour workweek, subsidized health care and long vacations, the Socialist government recently passed legislation granting employees the \xe2\x80\x9c'b'right to disconnect'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d The measure calls for companies with more than 50 employees to help ensure that work does not intrude into days off.'b'Sweden has been at the forefront of European countries seeking to engender employee satisfaction. 'b'An experiment with a six-hour workday'b' in the southern city of Gothenburg was recently scrapped after it was deemed too expensive. But proponents of the experiment, which was carried out over two years in a city-run retirement home, said it made employees happier, healthier and more productive. The six-hour workday has also proved successful in the private sector, including at a Toyota vehicle service center, where it helped 'b'improve business'b'.'b'Demographic pressures have been worrying countries across Europe, including Spain, Italy and Germany. In recent years in Denmark, policy makers have been so concerned about the 'b' birthrate'b' that they started to offer sex education classes focused on procreation rather than contraception. One travel company even introduced a \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Do It for Denmark'b'!\xe2\x80\x9d campaign, encouraging couples to take romantic holidays to try to procreate, claiming that Danes had 46 percent more sex while on holiday.'b'Sweden has among the highest fertility rates in the European Union, according to 'b'Eurostat'b', the bloc\xe2\x80\x99s statistic agency, in part because of the country\xe2\x80\x99s generous parental leave systems and immigration. But the fertility rate has nevertheless been decreasing recently.'b'Malin Hansson, 41, a sexologist and specialist in reproductive health in Gothenburg, applauded the initiative, arguing that sex reduced stress, improved sleep and strengthened immunity, while enriching intimacy between couples. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it was up to me, I would introduce this across the country,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cIn Sweden, sex is considered just another activity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lotta Dellve, a professor in the sociology department at the 'b'University of Gothenburg'b', said that her research showed that short bursts of physical activity during office hours had many benefits, including productivity. \xe2\x80\x9cThis activity could include sex, why not?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.'b'But Professor Dellve, who is married and has two daughters in their 20s, said it would be ridiculous for employers to mandate when employees should become intimate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is wonderful to see your spouse during the workday, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily want to have sex,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Stefan Nilsson, a Green Party member who sits on the health and welfare committee of the Swedish Parliament, said he was skeptical that taxpayers would want their money to finance work-hour sex, but allowed that the idea might be a canny investment in physical activity, noting that healthier workers cost the government less.'b'Others were less persuaded.'b'Tomas Vedestig, 42, a left-leaning municipal councilman in Overtornea, said that when Mr. Muskos made his pitch, his colleagues were so taken aback that they thought they had misheard him. Mr. Vedestig said the proposal was intrusive and threatened to embarrass people who do not have sexual partners; do not want to have sex; or had medical conditions that precluded sex.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s the employer\xe2\x80\x99s business to say, \xe2\x80\x98Go home for an hour and make babies,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he said. And some proponents worried the proposal was too stingy: \xe2\x80\x9cI spoke to a couple of older gentlemen who said, \xe2\x80\x98One hour? That is not enough time.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 Just five days after taking office, over dinner with his newly installed secretary of defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, President Trump was presented with the first of what will be many life-or-death decisions: whether to approve a commando raid that risked the lives of American Special Operations forces and foreign civilians alike.'b'President Barack Obama\xe2\x80\x99s national security aides had reviewed the plans for a risky attack on a small, heavily guarded brick home of a senior Qaeda collaborator in a mountainous village in a remote part of central 'b'Yemen'b'. But Mr. Obama did not act because the Pentagon wanted to launch the attack on a moonless night and the next one would come after his term had ended.'b'With two of his closest advisers, Jared Kushner and Stephen K. Bannon, joining the dinner at the White House along with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., Mr. Trump approved sending in the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s SEAL Team 6, hoping the raid early last Sunday would scoop up cellphones and laptop computers that could yield valuable clues about one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous terrorist groups. Vice President Mike Pence and Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser, also attended the dinner.'b'As it turned out, almost everything that could go wrong did. And on Wednesday, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to be present as the body of the American commando killed in the raid was returned home, the first military death on the new commander in chief\xe2\x80\x99s watch.'b'The death of Chief Petty Officer William Owens came after a chain of mishaps and misjudgments that plunged the elite commandos into a ferocious 50-minute firefight that also left three others wounded and a $75 million aircraft deliberately destroyed. There are allegations \xe2\x80\x94 which the Pentagon acknowledged on Wednesday night are most likely correct \xe2\x80\x94 that the mission also killed several civilians, including some children. The dead include, by the account of Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s branch in Yemen, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011.'b'Mr. Trump on Sunday hailed his first counterterrorism operation as a success, claiming the commandos captured \xe2\x80\x9cimportant intelligence that will assist the U.S. in preventing terrorism against its citizens and people around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d A statement by the military\xe2\x80\x99s Central Command on Wednesday night that acknowledged the likelihood of civilian casualties also said that the recovered materials had provided some initial information helpful to counterterrorism analysts. The statement did not provide details.'b'But the mission\xe2\x80\x99s casualties raise doubts about the months of detailed planning that went into the operation during the Obama administration and whether the right questions were raised before its approval. Typically, the president\xe2\x80\x99s advisers lay out the risks, but Pentagon officials declined to characterize any discussions with Mr. Trump.'b'A senior administration official said on Wednesday night that the Defense Department had conducted a legal review of the operation that Mr. Trump approved and that a Pentagon lawyer had signed off on it.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s new national security team, led by Mr. Flynn, the former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a retired general with experience in counterterrorism raids, has said that it wants to speed the decision-making when it comes to such strikes, delegating more power to lower-level officials so that the military may respond more quickly. Indeed, the Pentagon is drafting such plans to accelerate activities against the Qaeda branch in Yemen.'b'But doing that also raises the possibility of error. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can mitigate risk in missions like this, but you can\xe2\x80\x99t mitigate risk down to zero,\xe2\x80\x9d said William Wechsler, a former top counterterrorism official at the Pentagon.'b'In this case, the assault force of several dozen commandos, which also included elite soldiers from the United Arab Emirates, was jinxed from the start. Qaeda fighters were somehow tipped off to the stealthy advance toward the village \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps by the whine of American drones that local tribal leaders said were flying lower and louder than usual.'b'Through a communications intercept, the commandos knew that the mission had been somehow compromised, but pressed on toward their target roughly five miles from where they had been flown into the area. \xe2\x80\x9cThey kind of knew they were screwed from the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d one former SEAL Team 6 official said.'b'With the crucial element of surprise lost, the Americans and Emiratis found themselves in a gun battle with Qaeda fighters who took up positions in other houses, a clinic, a school and a mosque, often using women and children as cover, American military officials said in interviews this week.'b'The commandos were taken aback when some of the women grabbed weapons and started firing, multiplying the militant firepower beyond what they had expected. The Americans called in airstrikes from helicopter gunships and fighter aircraft that helped kill some 14 Qaeda fighters, but not before an MV-22 Osprey aircraft involved in the operation experienced a \xe2\x80\x9chard landing,\xe2\x80\x9d injuring three more American personnel on board. The Osprey, which the Marine Corps said cost $75 million, was badly damaged and had to be destroyed by an airstrike.'b'The raid, some details of which were 'b'first reported by The Washington Post'b', also destroyed much of the village of Yakla, and left senior Yemeni government officials seething. Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister, Abdul Malik Al Mekhlafi, condemned the raid on Monday in a post on his official Twitter account as \xe2\x80\x9cextrajudicial killings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Baraa Shiban, a Yemeni fellow for Reprieve, a London-based human rights group, said he spoke by phone to a tribal sheikh in the village, Jabbr Abu Soraima, who told him: \xe2\x80\x9cPeople were afraid to leave their houses because the sound of choppers and drones were all over the sky. Everyone feared of being hit by the drones or shot by the soldiers on the ground.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After initially denying there were any civilian casualties, Pentagon officials backtracked somewhat on Sunday after reports from the Yemeni authorities begin trickling in and grisly photographs of bloody children purportedly killed in the attack appeared on social media sites affiliated with Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s branch in Yemen.'b'Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman, said on Monday that some of the women were combatants.'b'The operation was the first known American-led ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him.'b'That mission and the raid over the weekend revealed the shortcomings of secretive military operations in Yemen. The United States was forced to withdraw the last 125 Special Operations advisers from the country in March 2015 after Houthi rebels ousted the government of President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 main counterterrorism partner.'b'The loss of Yemen as a base for American counterterrorism training, advising and intelligence-gathering was a significant blow to blunting the advance of Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s branch in the country and keeping tabs on their plots. The Pentagon has tried to start rebuilding its counterterrorism operations in Yemen, however; last year, American Special Operations forces helped Emirati troops evict Qaeda fighters from the port city of Mukalla.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Russia'b' has secretly deployed a new cruise missile that American officials say violates a landmark arms control treaty, posing a major test for President Trump as his administration is facing a crisis over its ties to Moscow.'b'The new Russian missile deployment also comes as the Trump administration is struggling to fill key policy positions at the State Department and the Pentagon \xe2\x80\x94 and to settle on a permanent replacement for Michael T. Flynn, the national security adviser who resigned late Monday. Mr. Flynn stepped down after it was revealed that he had misled the vice president and other officials over conversations with Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to Washington.'b'The ground-launched cruise missile at the center of American concerns is one that the Obama administration said in 2014 had been tested in violation of a 1987 treaty that bans American and Russian intermediate-range missiles based on land.'b'The Obama administration had sought to persuade the Russians to correct the violation while the missile was still in the test phase. Instead, the Russians have moved ahead with the system, deploying a fully operational unit.'b'Administration officials said the Russians now have two battalions of the prohibited cruise missile. One is still located at Russia\xe2\x80\x99s missile test site at Kapustin Yar in southern Russia near Volgograd. The other was shifted in December from that test site to an operational base elsewhere in the country, according to a senior official who did not provide further details and requested anonymity to discuss recent intelligence reports about the missile.'b'American officials had called the cruise missile the SSC-X-8. But the \xe2\x80\x9cX\xe2\x80\x9d has been removed from intelligence reports, indicating that American intelligence officials consider the missile to be operational and no longer a system in development.'b'The missile program has been a major concern for the Pentagon, which has developed options for how to respond, including deploying additional missile defenses in Europe or developing air-based or sea-based cruise missiles.'b'Russia\xe2\x80\x99s actions are politically significant, as well.'b'It is very unlikely that the Senate, which is already skeptical of President Vladimir V. Putin\xe2\x80\x99s intentions, would agree to ratify a new strategic arms control accord unless the alleged violation of the intermediate-range treaty is corrected. Mr. Trump has said the United States should \xe2\x80\x9cstrengthen and expand its nuclear capability.\xe2\x80\x9d But at the same time, he has talked of reaching a new arms agreement with Moscow that would reduce arms \xe2\x80\x9cvery substantially.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The deployment of the system could also substantially increase the military threat to NATO nations, depending on where the highly mobile system is based and how many more batteries are deployed in the future. Jim Mattis, the United States defense secretary, is scheduled to meet with allied defense ministers in Brussels on Wednesday.'b'Before he left his post last year as the NATO commander and retired from the military, Gen. Philip M. Breedlove warned that deployment of the cruise missile would be a militarily significant development that \xe2\x80\x9ccan\xe2\x80\x99t go unanswered.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Coming up with an arms control solution would not be easy. Each missile battalion is believed to have four mobile launchers with about half a dozen nuclear-tipped missiles allocated to each of the launchers. The mobile launcher for the cruise missile, however, closely resembles the mobile launcher used for the Iskander, a nuclear-tipped short-range system that is permitted under treaties.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis will make location and verification really tough,\xe2\x80\x9d General Breedlove said in an interview.'b'While senior Trump administration officials have not said where the new unit is based, there has been speculation in press reports that a missile system with similar characteristics is deployed in central Russia.'b'American and Russian relations were on a better footing in December 1987 when President Ronald Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Soviet leader, signed an arms accord, formally known as the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty and commonly called the I.N.F. treaty.'b'As a result of the agreement, Russia and the United States destroyed 2,692 missiles. The missiles the Russians destroyed included the SS-20. The Americans destroyed their Pershing II ballistic missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles, which were based in Western Europe.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can only hope that this history-making agreement will not be an end in itself but the beginning of a working relationship that will enable us to tackle the other urgent issues before us,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Reagan said at the time.'b'But the Russians developed buyer\xe2\x80\x99s remorse. During the George W. Bush administration, Sergei B. Ivanov, the Russian defense minister, suggested that the treaty be dropped because Russia still faced threats from nations on its periphery, including China.'b'The Bush administration, however, was reluctant to terminate a treaty that NATO nations valued and whose abrogation would have enabled Russia to build up forces that could potentially be directed at the United States\xe2\x80\x99 allies in Asia, as well.'b'In June 2013, Mr. Putin complained that \xe2\x80\x9cnearly all of our neighbors are developing these kinds of weapons systems\xe2\x80\x9d and described the Soviet Union\xe2\x80\x99s decision to conclude the I.N.F. treaty as \xe2\x80\x9cdebatable to say the least.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Russia began testing the cruise missile as early as 2008. Rose Gottemoeller, who was the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s top arms control official during the Obama administration and is now the deputy secretary general of NATO, first raised the alleged violation with Russian officials in 2013.'b'After years of frustration, the United States convened a November 2016 meeting in Geneva of a special verification commission established under the treaty to deal with compliance issues. 'b'It was the first meeting in 13 years of the commission'b', whose members include the United States, Russia and three former Soviet republics that are also party to the accord: Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.'b'But Russia denied it had breached the treaty and responded with its own allegations of American violations, which the Americans asserted were spurious.'b'The Obama administration argued that it was in the United States\xe2\x80\x99 interest to preserve the treaty. Having failed to persuade the Russians to fix the alleged violation, some military experts say, the United States needs to ratchet up the pressure by announcing plans to expand missile defenses in Europe and deploy sea-based or air-based nuclear missiles.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have strong tools like missile defense and counterstrike, and we should not take any of them off the table,\xe2\x80\x9d General Breedlove said.'b'Franklin C. Miller, a longtime Pentagon official who served on the National Security Council under Mr. Bush, said the Russian military may see the cruise missile as a way to expand its target coverage in Europe and China so it can free its strategic nuclear forces to concentrate on targets in the United States.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cClearly, the Russian military thinks this system is very important, important enough to break the treaty,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Miller said.'b'But he cautioned against responding in kind by seeking to deploy new American intermediate-range nuclear missiles in Europe.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing NATO needs is a bruising debate as we had in the late \xe2\x80\x9970s and early \xe2\x80\x9980s about new missile deployments in Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Miller added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe United States should build up its missile defense in Europe. But if the United States wants to deploy a military response, it should be sea-based.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Jon Wolfsthal, who served as a 'b'nuclear weapons'b' expert on the National Security Council during the Obama administration, said the United States, its NATO allies, Japan and South Korea needed to work together to put pressure on Russia to correct the violation. The response, 'b'he wrote on Twitter'b', should be taken by the \xe2\x80\x9calliance as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Trump administration is in the beginning stages of reviewing nuclear policy and has not said how it plans to respond.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not comment on intelligence matters,\xe2\x80\x9d Mark Toner, the acting State Department spokesman, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have made very clear our concerns about Russia\xe2\x80\x99s violation, the risks it poses to European and Asian security, and our strong interest in returning Russia to compliance with the treaty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'THE HAGUE \xe2\x80\x94 Harry van Bommel, a left-wing member of the Dutch Parliament, had persuasive allies in convincing voters that they should reject a trade pact with 'b'Ukraine'b' \xe2\x80\x94 his special \xe2\x80\x9cUkrainian team,\xe2\x80\x9d a gleefully contrarian group of \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9s whose sympathies lay with 'b'Russia'b'.'b'They attended public meetings, appeared on television and used social media to denounce Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s pro-Western government as a bloodthirsty kleptocracy, unworthy of Dutch support. As Mr. Van Bommel recalled, it \xe2\x80\x9cwas very handy to show that not all Ukrainians were in favor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Handy but also misleading: The most active members of the Ukrainian team were actually from Russia, or from breakaway Russian-speaking regions of Ukraine, and parroted the Kremlin line.'b'The Dutch referendum, held last April, became a battering ram aimed at the European Union. With turnout low, Dutch voters rejected the 'b' trade agreement'b' between the European Union and Ukraine, delighting Moscow, emboldening pro-Russia populists around Europe and leaving political elites aghast.'b'It is unclear whether the Ukrainian team was directed by Russia or if it was acting out of shared sympathies, and Mr. Van Bommel said he never checked their identities. But Europe\xe2\x80\x99s political establishment, already rattled by Britain\xe2\x80\x99s vote to leave the European Union and the election of President 'b'Trump'b' in the United States, is worried that the 'b'Netherlands'b' referendum could foreshadow what is to come.'b'With 'b'elections slated for France, Germany'b' and possibly Italy this year, officials across Europe are warning that the Russians are actively interfering, echoing the Central Intelligence Agency\xe2\x80\x99s assertions 'b'that Moscow meddled in the United States presidential election'b'.'b'Norway announced this month that Russia-linked hackers had attacked government ministries and a political party. Britain\xe2\x80\x99s defense minister has accused Moscow of \xe2\x80\x9cweaponizing disinformation.\xe2\x80\x9d German, French and Italian officials have also accused Russia-linked partisans of meddling.'b'The Netherlands is holding its own national elections on March 15, and domestic intelligence officials say that foreign countries, notably Russia, have tried hundreds of times in recent months to penetrate the computers of government agencies and businesses. Volkskrant, a Dutch newspaper, reported last week that the same two Russian hacking groups that pilfered emails from the Democratic National Committee were among those targeting the Netherlands.'b'The Dutch interior minister announced that all vote tallies in the March election would be done by hand so as to remove computers from the electoral process and calm fears of hacking by unidentified \xe2\x80\x9cstate actors.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose in power are very worried \xe2\x80\x94 there is more than ample reason for alarm over interference in elections,\xe2\x80\x9d said Sijbren de Jong of the Hague Center for Strategic Studies, a research group in The Hague, the seat of the Dutch government. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the real risk are populists who run, knowingly or unwittingly, with Russia\xe2\x80\x99s agenda because they know it is damaging to the status quo in Europe that they want to destroy. All Russia really needs to do is sit back and let populists do their bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No one has yet come up with concrete evidence that the Russian state, rather than individual Russians, is working to skew the election, and many wonder why Moscow would even bother trying to do so in a small country with none of the geopolitical heft of the United States or Germany. But Mr. de Jong said the referendum last year showed that \xe2\x80\x9ca little effort goes a long way\xe2\x80\x9d and could help \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy the European Union from inside.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Netherlands should be difficult terrain for Russia. Last year, the Dutch Safety Board linked Russia to the death of 298 people \xe2\x80\x94 including nearly 200 Dutch nationals \xe2\x80\x94 in a passenger plane flying from Amsterdam that was shot down in July 2014 over 'b'territory held by Russian-armed rebels in eastern Ukraine'b'.'b'The finding was a public relations disaster for Moscow, and Russian hackers have attacked computers at the Dutch agency, while Russian sympathizers in the Netherlands, including members of Mr. Van Bommel\xe2\x80\x99s Ukrainian team, have labored tirelessly to promote implausible alternative theories for the downing of the Boeing jet carrying 'b'Malaysia Airlines Flight 17'b'.'b'Even Geert Wilders, the country\xe2\x80\x99s anti-Europe, 'b'anti-immigrant, anti-establishment firebrand'b', has kept a distance from Moscow, unlike populist leaders in France and Italy. Yet if Mr. Wilders, whose party is leading in opinion polls, is not an ally, his Euroskeptic agenda dovetails perfectly with the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s broader agenda to weaken the European Union and shatter European unity against Russia.'b'Sico van der Meer, a research fellow at the Netherlands Institute of International Relations, said Russia viewed the West as an adversary and had a clear interest in seeing the election of anti-establishment populists who, no matter what their personal take on Russia, all want to undermine the European Union and, in some cases, NATO.'b'Russians, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve that making your enemy weaker makes yourself stronger.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Dutch intelligence agency, the AIVD, in a publicly released assessment of Russian activities, agreed that measuring the scale of any state-sponsored Russian interference was extremely difficult, as Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s effort to shape public opinion \xe2\x80\x9ctakes place in a twilight zone between diplomacy and intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the report also noted that the Netherlands had been targeted as part of a \xe2\x80\x9cglobal campaign to influence policy and perceptions on Russia\xe2\x80\x9d and, as part of this effort, Moscow had made use of a \xe2\x80\x9cnetwork of contacts built up over the years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One such contact is Vladimir Kornilov, a Russian-born historian and political analyst who grew up in eastern Ukraine and now lives in The Hague, where he runs a one-man research outfit called the Center for Eurasian Studies. Emails stolen by a pro-Ukrainian hacking group show how Mr. Kornilov offered information and advice to politicians and others in Moscow during his previous work at a Russian-funded research institute in Kiev.'b'Before the Dutch referendum last year, Mr. Kornilov campaigned against the Ukraine trade deal, describing himself benignly as \xe2\x80\x9ca Ukrainian expat in The Hague\xe2\x80\x9d who was \xe2\x80\x9cstunned by the seemingly endless stream of lies and propaganda\xe2\x80\x9d about Russia and felt obliged to respond.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter the referendum here, everybody thought this was just a Dutch problem, but now we see it was just the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kornilov said in an interview, denying any financial or other links to the Russian state. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a huge crisis in the European Union.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nor did he agitate alone. He contacted Mr. Van Bommel as well as Thierry Baudet, the head of a conservative research group, Forum for Democracy, which he has since converted into a political party that takes Russia\xe2\x80\x99s side on a host of issues and is competing for seats in the March election on a platform of hostility to the European Union.'b'During the referendum campaign, Mr. Baudet posted a Twitter message saying that Ukraine \xe2\x80\x9cis not a nation state\xe2\x80\x9d and retweeted a false report that Ukrainian soldiers had crucified a 3-year-old Russian-speaking boy in eastern Ukraine. The crucifixion story began with an invented report by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s main state-controlled television channel, which interviewed a supposed Ukrainian witness to the crucifixion who was later identified as a Russian actress.'b'The bogus crucifixion story circulated through social media and was followed by an even more blatant exercise in fake news, when 'b'a video'b' appeared on YouTube that purported to show members of the Azov Battalion, a group of Ukrainian militants, burning the Dutch flag and threatening terrorist attacks if Dutch voters did not support Ukraine.'b'The video was quickly dismissed as a fraud and'b' was later linked by Bellingcat, a British-based investigative website'b', to a so-called troll factory in St. Petersburg, a Russian institute that churns out fake news and abuses Russia\xe2\x80\x99s critics online, using social media as a distribution system.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll the Kremlin has to do is click like or retweet and then sit back and say \xe2\x80\x98thank you,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. de Jong, the researcher.'b'The anonymity of the internet, he added, makes it difficult to distinguish between ordinary people voicing their genuine opinions and state-sponsored trolls. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no smoking gun, only lots of smoke,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. de Jong acknowledged.'b'Mr. Baudet, in an interview in Amsterdam, denied spouting Russia propaganda and said he was merely trying to counter what he called \xe2\x80\x9cEurope\xe2\x80\x99s remarkable Russophobia\xe2\x80\x9d and to make sure that Russia\xe2\x80\x99s side of the story did not get drowned out.'b'Ukraine did send officials and activists to the Netherlands to lobby support for a \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d vote, presenting Ukraine as a victim of Russian aggression. But, unlike some activists on the other side, they openly declared their identities and affiliation.'b'Michiel Servaes, a Labor Party member of Parliament, campaigned in favor of the pact with Ukraine and said people like Mr. Baudet promoted a narrative that was \xe2\x80\x9cword for word what would be used by a spokesman from the Kremlin.\xe2\x80\x9d He recalled facing a barrage of criticism at one public meeting from a member of the audience who introduced herself as a Ukrainian but who turned out to be Russian.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was really quite shocking,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Servaes said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople presented themselves as Ukrainians but were in reality Russians.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For his part, Mr. Van Bommel acknowledged that some of his \xe2\x80\x9cUkrainian\xe2\x80\x9d helpers were perhaps Russian but said it was not his job to verify their identities.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never ask people to see their passports,\xe2\x80\x9d he said during an interview in The Hague. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they support our political platform they are welcome.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A particularly active member of the Ukrainian team was Nikita Ananjev, a 26-year-old student born in Moscow who moved with his mother to the Netherlands, where he is now chairman of the Russian Student Association.'b'He said he had attended 15 or more public meetings across the Netherlands during the referendum campaign, speaking out against the Ukrainian pact and what he described as the European Union\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crusty and corrupted nomenklatura\xe2\x80\x9d and its unfairly negative views of Russia.'b'Mr. Ananjev, now a university student in the eastern Dutch region of Twente, went to Moscow in 2013 for a \xe2\x80\x9cyouth leaders school,\xe2\x80\x9d a program sponsored by Rossotrudnichestvo, a state-funded organization that promotes cultural exchanges and works to promote Moscow\xe2\x80\x99s take on the world. In December, he visited Brussels for the European Russian Forum, an annual gathering of Moscow-friendly politicians and experts supported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.'b'Complaining that Russians who defend their country and criticize its adversaries often get labeled unfairly as intelligence operatives, he said in an interview: \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a spy. Not yet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'ALBI, France \xe2\x80\x94 The paint is fading, but the word is still clear: 'b'Alimentation'b', \xe2\x80\x9cGroceries.\xe2\x80\x9d It seems like a stage prop, grafted above the window of the empty old storefront. Opposite stands a tattoo parlor. Nobody enters or leaves. The street is deserted.'b'Keep walking, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find more vacant storefronts, scattered around the old center of this town dominated by its imposing 13th-century brick cathedral, one of 'b'France'b'\xe2\x80\x99s undisputed treasures. Tourist shops and chain clothing stores are open, but missing are the groceries, cafes and butcher shops that once bustled with life and for centuries defined small-town France.'b'Measuring change, and decay, is not easy in France, where beauty is just around the corner and life can seem unchanged over decades. But the decline evident in Albi is replicated in hundreds of other places. France is losing the core of its historic provincial towns \xe2\x80\x94 dense hubs of urbanity deep in the countryside where judges judged, Balzac set his novels, prefects issued edicts and citizens shopped for 50 cheeses.'b'In January, I went to Albi while covering the French presidential election. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known the city for nearly 35 years, visiting a handful of times as part of a lifetime\xe2\x80\x99s engagement with France that began at age 4 when my family moved to Paris. My first trip to Albi came in 1982, with my college girlfriend, and I found a bustling, jewel-like city that took its ochre-red color from bricks that had been used since the Middle Ages and echoed the hot, meridional sun. I was captivated.'b'I returned in January not on the trail of a presidential candidate but to better understand a French paradox just beneath the surface of the campaign: the deep pride felt by the French in what they regard as an unparalleled way of life, always accompanied by anxiety that it is facing extinction.'b'The campaign is like few before it in France, because of the looming question of whether the far-right candidate, Marine Le Pen, will do the once-unthinkable, and win. She has already pushed the discourse rightward and made a visceral promise to voters: to protect not just France, but 'b'Frenchness. 'b'Whether the menace is defined as Islam, immigration or globalization, her vow to voters is the same: I am the woman to preserve the French way of life.'b'The visible decline of so many historic city centers is intertwined with these anxieties. Losing the ancient French provincial capital is another blow to 'b'Frenchness 'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94'b' tangible evidence of a disappearing way of life that resonates in France in the same way that the hollowing out of main streets did in the United States decades ago. A survey of French towns found that commercial vacancies have almost doubled to 10.4 percent in the past 15 years. As these towns have declined, voters have often turned sharply rightward. Albi is traditionally centrist, but the same conditions of decline and political anxiety are present, too.'b'Turn a corner in Albi, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll pass the last school inside the historic center, abandoned a few years ago. Down another street is the last toy store, now closed, and around a corner is the last independent grocery store, also shuttered. Walk down the empty, narrow streets on some nights and the silence is so complete that you can hear your footsteps on the stones.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf nothing is done, a substantial part of the French soul will perish, taking with it more than half the French population,\xe2\x80\x9d the businessman Charles Beigbeder wrote in Le Figaro recently, calling for a \xe2\x80\x9cMarshall Plan\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cperipheral France.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I arrived in Albi, population 49,000, on a Thursday evening, having driven in from Toulouse, an hour away. At the edge of town, I passed a giant shopping center, Les Portes d\xe2\x80\x99Albi, where the parking lot was black with cars. In the Albi I had known before, people had lived in town above their stores. Centuries of accumulated living were packed inside the tree-shaded boulevards. Shopping was as much about sociability as about buying.'b'Before arriving, I picked up a government report, an autopsy of many French provincial capitals: Agen, Limoges, Bourges, Arras, Beziers, Auxerre, Vichy, Calais and others. In these old towns, many harder hit than Albi, the interplay of the human-scale architecture, weathered stone and brick, and public life had been one of the crucibles of French history and culture for centuries. Now they were endangered, as even the dry language of the report conveyed that an essential part of French life is disappearing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis phenomenon of the devitalization of the urban centers is worrisome,\xe2\x80\x9d the government report declared, \xe2\x80\x9cas the stores contribute so much to city life and largely fashion it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'My first appointment was with the town whistle-blower, who had agreed to give me a tour. Florian Jourdain wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exposing local corruption but the decline of the town that was hidden in plain sight. His meticulous blog, picked up by the French press, caused such resentment among Albi\xe2\x80\x99s commercial establishment that last year the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 association staged a demonstration against him in the main square.'b'With a degree in history and studies in geography, Mr. Jourdain published an online map, with a skull-and-crossbones marking each vacant store. He discovered that nearly 40 percent of the remaining shops sold clothes, and he suspected that much of the trade was with tourists. Only a single traditional boulangerie, or bakery, remained in Albi\xe2\x80\x99s old core, and not a single free-standing butcher shop.'b'A Parisian by origin, Mr. Jourdain worked quasi-undercover, and few in town, even among his allies, seemed to know his last name. I met him on a Friday morning in the windswept plaza of the looming Cath\xc3\xa9drale Sainte-C\xc3\xa9cile, a giant brick fortress built eight centuries ago to awe the region\xe2\x80\x99s restive heretics. As we started on the Rue Mari\xc3\xa8s, the city\xe2\x80\x99s main commercial street, Mr. Jourdain pulled his hood down over his head to avoid being recognized, as I struggled to mentally repopulate the empty street with the liveliness that had delighted me 35 years before.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor me, if you are precise, you can\xe2\x80\x99t be attacked,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of his work. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a big problem for me that there are no grocery stores in the center of the city. There is no neighborhood cafe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Street after street, we took the measure of the town\xe2\x80\x99s fragility. Name tags were missing from buzzers at the doorways of the old buildings. Above them the shutters stayed closed night and day, with estimates that 15 percent of these old houses are vacant.'b'Mr. Jourdain knew something was amiss soon after arriving from Paris in 2013. \xe2\x80\x9cRight away I realized it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust across from us, and right next to us, there were two magnificent buildings, vacant. I thought it was strange. And then I started to see more and more empty stores.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We came to the Place Lap\xc3\xa9rouse, named after the great French explorer who was born in Albi in the 18th century. I had a flashback. On a warm afternoon many years before, I sat on a bench here, gazing at the old buildings around me. It had been quiet enough to hear the birds in the centenarian plane trees shading the square.'b'Now, it was a frigid intersection combined with a soulless pedestrian plaza. Cars whizzed past.'b'We moved on, passing two storefronts with \xe2\x80\x9ctotal liquidation\xe2\x80\x9d written across them. The sense I had many years before, of a dense urban space that was a living, breathing organism, was gone.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook, here, this used to be a cafe,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, pointing to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s clothing store where the faint remains of a traditional cafe awning were still visible.'b'Mr. Jourdain spoke with the fervor of a disappointed suitor. He had moved to Albi to embrace its beauty and to escape the clamor of Paris but instead found a creeping listlessness. He saw his role as waking up his fellow citizens. \xe2\x80\x9cThe risk is great for our beautiful episcopal city,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in his blog.'b'We moved on to the empty Rue de la Croix Blanche. Again, we were the only walkers, passing a line of closed stores. On the Rue Puech B\xc3\xa9renguier we passed the last grocery store. On the Rue Peyroli\xc3\xa8re we saw the abandoned elementary school, closed in 2013, a classic Third Republic building where generations of Albigeois were educated. On the wall inside, a children\xe2\x80\x99s drawing from the last class was still visible.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe cries of children will resound no longer,\xe2\x80\x9d the local paper, La D\xc3\xa9p\xc3\xaache du Midi, wrote when the school closed.'b'In former days, the covered market, the March\xc3\xa9 Couvert, would have been a hub of life and commerce. No more. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel as though time has been suspended,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jourdain said.'b'Hours had passed on a sunny Friday in the center of town, yet on some streets we saw almost no one. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see clearly that we are on a street that is dying,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jourdain said on Rue Emile Grand as we concluded our tour. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are whole buildings where there isn\xe2\x80\x99t a soul.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I called City Hall for a meeting with the mayor, a member of France\xe2\x80\x99s center-right party, but was met with a distinct lack of enthusiasm from her spokeswoman. I was put off with the promise of a phone call the following week, and when I finally reached the mayor, St\xc3\xa9phanie Guiraud-Chaumeil, she argued that urban \xe2\x80\x9cdevitalization\xe2\x80\x9d has had a \xe2\x80\x9crelatively moderate impact.\xe2\x80\x9d She also angrily condemned Mr. Jourdain.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe is an extraterrestrial,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho came here to get talked about.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The head of the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 association, who had led the demonstration against Mr. Jourdain, was equally elusive. He was not to be found at the anonymous basement supermarket he runs beneath the March\xc3\xa9 Couvert. Nobody knew when he would show up or how to reach him, and the association\xe2\x80\x99s office in the center of town had long since closed.'b'The next morning was a Saturday, the busiest shopping day of the week, with shops promising sales and customers inside the clothing stores. There was a hint of the liveliness I had remembered from many years before, but these were weekend shoppers, many from out of town.'b'I went to see Fabien Lacoste, a Socialist city councilman, in the shadow of the cathedral. As on most Saturdays, he was at work, flipping crepes at his outdoor food stand.'b'To him, Albi\xe2\x80\x99s fate was a cultural misfortune. City leaders had poured money into a high-concept modernistic new culture center at the town\xe2\x80\x99s edge. And the shopping mall had been built. Large grocery chains, called hypermarkets, had also been constructed outside the city, with free parking. It is not that Albi no longer had commerce, or activity. But the essence of the ancient city was being lost.'b'The rise of the shopping centers traced the sharp rise in living standards brought on by what the French call the 'b'Trentes Glorieuses'b', the 30 glorious years from 1945 to 1975. Growth was around 4 percent; purchasing power of the average worker\xe2\x80\x99s salary rose 170 percent. The boost to consumer demand could not be met by the old center-city structure of small shops, small purchases. Malls and strip centers were born.'b'Today, France has the highest density of such retail space in all of Europe, even as vacancies in 190 historic town centers have gone to 10.4 percent in 2015 from 6.1 percent in 2001, according to the government report. Thus, the French paradox: a newly consumerist society that had stripped France of its \xe2\x80\x9csoul\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 made even worse, now, by the fact that economic growth has collapsed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no bar, no cafe. We\xe2\x80\x99re in the southwest, for heaven\xe2\x80\x99s sake. It\xe2\x80\x99s a scandal,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Lacoste, serving up crepes to his customers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve lost that conviviality that was our signature. Before, each little neighborhood had its own center, with its own cafe. All that has disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I deplore is this devitalization,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lacoste added. \xe2\x80\x9cYou won\xe2\x80\x99t be doing your shopping here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By Sunday, Albi had reverted to its weekday torpor. I went for my evening run along the green Tarn river and passed a half-dozen people at most. In the twilight the town felt abandoned.'b'I finally caught up with the head of the merchants\xe2\x80\x99 association just as he was leaving his supermarket. He did not seem pleased to see me and was even less pleased with Mr. Jourdain. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are town centers where the situation is much more complicated,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'My last interview before leaving town was with Eric Lamarre. Last year, he closed Albi\xe2\x80\x99s last toy store. \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty years ago, the center of town was still animated,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople really came to town to buy. There were loads of lovely things. It buzzed with people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The big shopping center opened in 2009, and his business declined until the end, when he was losing 50,000 euros (about $53,000) a year.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a political problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThese towns have been had.

Flynn \xe2\x80\x94 whom the administration blamed for misleading Mr. Pence about the extent of his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the United States \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Pence looked uncomfortable but said he supported Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s decision to ask for Mr. Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s resignation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet me say, I\xe2\x80\x99m very grateful for the close working relationship I have with the president of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pence said, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cI was disappointed to learn that the facts that have been conveyed to me by General Flynn were inaccurate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The administration has not explained why Mr. Trump did not immediately tell Mr. Pence about Mr. Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s conversations with the ambassador after the president learned about them from his top lawyer, and Mr. Pence did not shed light on that question on Monday.'b'Smiles and handshakes abounded before and after Mr. Pence delivered his reassuring words, but Europeans \xe2\x80\x94 'b'taken aback'b' by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s occasional fulminations against European institutions that have long been the bedrock of American policy here \xe2\x80\x94 were 'b'still wary'b'.'b'Last month, Mr. Trump 'b'called the European Union'b' \xe2\x80\x9cbasically a vehicle for Germany,\xe2\x80\x9d language that stunned leaders of the bloc, which has been struggling with economic malaise, migration and Britain\xe2\x80\x99s intention to withdraw. Days later, Mr. Tusk, who represents the union\xe2\x80\x99s 28 national leaders, described Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bombastic and skeptical language as a 'b'potential threat to European unity'b' alongside Russian aggression, Chinese assertiveness and Islamist terrorism.'b'And just moments before Mr. Pence held his final news conference of his first overseas trip here, 'b'Mr. Trump 'b''b'posted on Twitter'b': \xe2\x80\x9cThe FAKE NEWS media is trying to say that large scale immigration in Sweden is working out just beautifully. NOT!\xe2\x80\x9d (Sweden is a member of the European Union, but not of NATO.)'b'On Monday, after meeting with Mr. Pence, Mr. Tusk said he felt reassured. In a 'b'detailed statement'b', he said he had asked Mr. Pence whether the Trump administration was committed to maintaining an international order based on rules and laws; whether Mr. Trump was committed to NATO and to \xe2\x80\x9cthe closest possible trans-Atlantic cooperation\xe2\x80\x9d; and whether Europe could count \xe2\x80\x9cas always in the past, on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 wholehearted and unequivocal, let me repeat, unequivocal support for the idea of a united Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn reply to these three matters,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Tusk said, \xe2\x80\x9cI heard today from Vice President Pence three times \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99! After such a positive declaration, both Europeans and Americans must simply practice what they preach.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Tusk said he appreciated a story that Mr. Pence had shared during the weekend at the 'b'Munich Security Conference'b', a gathering of foreign policy experts, about visiting Europe for the first time, as a teenager.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn Saturday in Munich,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Tusk said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou mentioned that during your trip across Europe in 1977 with your older brother, you found yourselves at some point in West Berlin, marveling at what you saw, then crossing through Checkpoint Charlie only to see the \xe2\x80\x98shadow of repression hanging over people.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs you know,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Tusk continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI had been living under this shadow for over 30 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his statement, Mr. Tusk also recalled President Ronald Reagan\xe2\x80\x99s fight against communism.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidency has upended Washington, where his 'b'rambling and grievance-filled news conferences'b', chaotic decision-making and thin staffing levels have left much of the capital uncertain how to manage the earthquake he has wrought. The aftershocks swept across Europe, leaving those who depend on the United States for security and vital economic ties uncertain about where they stand, particularly in the face of a resurgent Russia.'b'A cavalcade of surrogates for Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x94 Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and now Mr. Pence \xe2\x80\x94 have come to Europe in recent days to try to settle nerves here. Their speeches have helped.'b'But nobody is quite sure whether these surrogates truly speak for Mr. Trump or whether, even if they do, Mr. Trump might soon change his mind.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course European Union officials are happy to have Pence here, and they are happy about what he said, but that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to cancel out the deep and lingering doubt in many other European capitals about what the White House and President Trump actually want,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Guntram B. Wolff'b', director of Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels, said by telephone. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat Europe still has to do is to be prepared for the worst, and to try to work with partners around the world to support and defend multilateralism, and to do so without being antagonistic.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among the concerns shared by many European policy makers is the possibility that the Trump administration will impose 'b'protectionist'b' tariffs as part of the president\xe2\x80\x99s goal of bringing jobs back to the United States.'b'In brief remarks before his own meeting with Mr. Pence, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, warned that the United States was more dependent on Europe than was commonly believed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe U.S. economy is depending more than some in the U.S. would think on the exchanges, the trade volumes, including Indiana, by the way, between the U.S. and the European Union,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Juncker said, referring to the state where Mr. Pence was governor before becoming vice president.'b'In his own remarks, NATO\xe2\x80\x99s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said he had been reassured of the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to NATO.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have heard exactly the same firm message from the president of the United States in two phone calls, from the vice president in meetings today and in Munich, and from Secretaries Mattis and Kelly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, referring to Mr. Mattis and the secretary of Homeland Security, John F. Kelly, who were both in Munich over the weekend. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have all conveyed the same message: that the United States is firmly committed to the trans-Atlantic partnership and have an unwavering support for the NATO alliance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'FORDL\xc3\x82NDIA, Brazil \xe2\x80\x94 The Amazon jungle already swallowed the Winding Brook Golf Course. Floods ravaged the cemetery, leaving behind a stockpile of concrete crosses. The 100-bed hospital designed by the acclaimed Detroit architect 'b'Albert Kahn'b'? Plunderers destroyed it.'b'Given the scale of decay and decrepitude in this town \xe2\x80\x94 founded in 1928 by the industrialist 'b'Henry Ford'b' in the far reaches of the Amazon River Basin \xe2\x80\x94 I didn\xe2\x80\x99t expect to come across the stately, largely well-preserved homes on Palm Avenue. But there they were, thanks to the squatters.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis street was a looters\xe2\x80\x99 paradise, with thieves taking furniture, doorknobs, anything the Americans left behind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Expedito Duarte de Brito, 71, a retired milkman who dwells in one of the homes built for Ford managers in what was planned to be a utopian plantation town. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought, \xe2\x80\x98Either I occupy this piece of history or it joins the other ruins of Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In more than a decade of reporting from Latin America, I made dozens of trips to the Amazon, lured back time and again by its 'b'vast rivers'b', 'b'magnificent skies'b', 'b'boomtowns'b', 'b'lost civilizations'b' and tales of 'b'hubris'b' consumed by nature. But somehow I never got to Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia.'b'That finally changed when I boarded a riverboat this year in Santar\xc3\xa9m, an outpost at the confluence of the Amazon and Tapaj\xc3\xb3s rivers, and made the six-hour trip to the place where Ford, one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s richest men, tried turning a colossal swath of Brazilian jungle into a Midwest fantasyland.'b'I explored the outpost on foot, wandering the ruins and talking to gold prospectors, farmers and descendants of plantation workers who live here. Hardly a lost city, Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia is home to about 2,000 people, some who live in the crumbling structures built nearly a century ago.'b'Ford, the automobile manufacturer who is considered a founder of American industrial mass-production methods, hatched his plan for Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia in a bid to produce his own source of the rubber needed for making tires and car parts like valves, hoses and gaskets.'b'In doing so, he waded into an industry shaped by imperialism and claims of botanical subterfuge. 'b'Brazil'b' was home to 'b'Hevea brasiliensis'b', the coveted rubber tree, and the Amazon Basin had boomed from 1879 to 1912 as industries in North America and Europe fed the demand for rubber.'b'But to the dismay of Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s leaders, Henry Wickham, a British botanist and explorer, had 'b'spirited'b' thousands of Hevea seeds out of Santar\xc3\xa9m, providing the genetic stock for rubber plantations in British, Dutch and French colonies in Asia.'b'These endeavors on the other side of the world devastated Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s rubber economy. But Ford despised relying on the Europeans, fearing a proposal by Winston Churchill to create a rubber cartel. So, in a move that pleased Brazilian officials, Ford acquired a giant stretch of land in the Amazon.'b'From the start, ineptitude and tragedy plagued the venture, 'b'meticulously documented'b' in a book by the historian Greg Grandin that I read on the boat as it made its way up the Tapaj\xc3\xb3s. Disdainful of experts who could have advised them on tropical agriculture, Ford\xe2\x80\x99s men planted seeds of questionable value and let leaf blight ravage the plantation.'b'Despite such setbacks, Ford constructed an American-style town, which he wanted inhabited by Brazilians hewing to what he considered American values.'b'Employees moved into clapboard bungalows \xe2\x80\x94 designed, of course, in Michigan \xe2\x80\x94 some of which are still standing. Streetlamps illuminated concrete sidewalks. Portions of these footpaths persist in the town, near red fire hydrants, in the shadow of decaying dance halls and crumbling warehouses.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt turns out Detroit isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only place where Ford produced ruins,\xe2\x80\x9d said Guilherme Lisboa, 67, the owner of a small inn called the Pousada Americana.'b'Beyond producing rubber, Ford, an avowed teetotaler, 'b'anti-Semite'b' and skeptic of the Jazz Age, clearly wanted life in the jungle to be more transformative. His American managers forbade consumption of alcohol, while promoting gardening, square dancing and readings of the poetry of Emerson and Longfellow.'b'Going even further in Ford\xe2\x80\x99s quest for utopia, so-called sanitation squads operated across the outpost, killing stray dogs, draining puddles of water where malaria-transmitting mosquitoes could multiply and checking employees for venereal diseases.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith a surety of purpose and incuriosity about the world that seems all too familiar, Ford deliberately rejected expert advice and set out to turn the Amazon into the Midwest of his imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Grandin, the historian, wrote in his account of the town.'b'These days, the ruins of Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia stand as testament to the folly of trying to bend the jungle to the will of man.'b'Seeking to promote the automobile as a form of recreation \xe2\x80\x94 along with the golf course, tennis courts, a movie theater and swimming pools \xe2\x80\x94 managers laid out nearly 30 miles of roads around Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia. But cars are mostly absent on the town\xe2\x80\x99s muddy lanes, eclipsed by the motorbikes found in towns across the Amazon.'b'By the end of 'b'World War II'b', it was clear that cultivating rubber trees around Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia could not be profitable in the face of leaf blight and competition from synthetic rubber and Asian plantations freed from Japanese domination.'b'After Ford turned the town over to Brazil\xe2\x80\x99s government in 1945, officials transferred Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia from one public agency to another, largely for unsuccessful experiments in tropical agriculture. The town went into a seemingly perpetual state of decline.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing happens here, and that\xe2\x80\x99s how I like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joaquim Pereira da Silva, 73, a farmer from Minas Gerais State who followed his star to Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia in 1997. Now he lives on Palm Avenue in an old American house he bought for 20,000 reais (about $6,670) from a squatter who fixed it up.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Americans had no idea about rubber but they knew how to build things to last,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Something about the failed utopia strikes a chord with scholars and artists in other parts of the world. Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia 'b'inspired'b' a 2008 album by the Icelandic composer Johann Johannsson and a 1997 'b'novel'b' by Eduardo Sguiglia about an Argentine adventurer who travels here to recruit plantation laborers.'b'Some descendants of workers who settled in Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia, along with new migrants from other parts in Brazil, have small plots where zebu cattle graze. Others plant manioc in areas where rubber trees were chopped down decades ago. Many survive on small 'b'social welfare payments or pensions'b'.'b'Then there are residents like Eduardo Silva dos Santos, born 66 years ago in the hospital conceived by Kahn, the 'b'architect'b' who designed much of 20th-century Detroit. Mr. dos Santos now lives in a small house near the hospital\xe2\x80\x99s ruins.'b'Scavenging material left by the Americans, he fashioned a fishing lantern from old car parts and a spice grinder from discarded machinery. Mr. dos Santos expressed mixed views of Fordl\xc3\xa2ndia under American stewardship, growing up in the years after Ford unloaded the town.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis place in Ford\xe2\x80\x99s day was clean, no insects, no animals, no jungle in the town,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. dos Santos, one of 11 children born to a family that depended on the rubber plantation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy father worked for them,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand he did what they ordered him to do. Workers are like dogs: They obey.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But to Ford\xe2\x80\x99s dismay, sometimes they didn\xe2\x80\x99t obey.'b'Managers tried enforcing the alcohol prohibition, but workers simply hopped on boats to a so-called island of innocence nearby with bars and brothels. And in 1930, workers fed up with eating Ford\xe2\x80\x99s diet of oatmeal, canned peaches and brown rice in a sweltering dining hall staged a full-scale riot.'b'They 'b'smashed time clocks'b', cut electricity to the plantation and chanted, \xe2\x80\x9cBrazil for Brazilians; kill all the Americans,\xe2\x80\x9d forcing some of the managers to decamp into the jungle.'b'The Amazon offered its own challenges to the Americans. Some couldn\xe2\x80\x99t adapt to the conditions here, suffering nervous breakdowns. One drowned when a storm on the Tapaj\xc3\xb3s River toppled his boat. Another manager left after three of his children died from tropical fevers.'b'Ford might have avoided such tragedies, and the ruinous management of the plantation, if he had sought counsel from specialists in caring for rubber trees or scholars of the Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to thwart grandiose ventures. But he seemed to abhor learning from the past.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHistory is bunk,\xe2\x80\x9d Ford 'b'told'b' The New York Times in 1921. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat difference does it make how many times the ancient Greeks flew their kites?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 A wave of leaks from government officials has hobbled the Trump administration, leading some to draw comparisons to countries like Egypt, Turkey and Pakistan, where shadowy networks within government bureaucracies, often referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cdeep states,\xe2\x80\x9d undermine and coerce elected governments.'b'So is the United States seeing the rise of its own deep state?'b'Not quite, experts say, but the echoes are real \xe2\x80\x94 and disturbing.'b'Though leaks can be a normal and healthy check on a president\xe2\x80\x99s power, what\xe2\x80\x99s happening now extends much further. The United States, those experts warn, risks developing an entrenched culture of conflict between the president and his own bureaucracy.'b'Issandr El Amrani, an analyst who has 'b'written on Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s deep state'b', said he was concerned by the parallels, though the United States has not reached authoritarian extremes.'b'The growing discord between a president and his bureaucratic rank-and-file, he warned, \xe2\x80\x9cis dangerous, it encourages deep divisions within society, it creates these constant tensions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs an American citizen I find it really quite disheartening to see all these similarities to Egypt,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. El Amrani said.'b'Though the deep state is sometimes discussed as a shadowy conspiracy, it helps to think of it instead as a political conflict between a nation\xe2\x80\x99s leader and its governing institutions.'b'That can be deeply destabilizing, leading both sides to wield state powers like the security services or courts against one another, corrupting those institutions in the process.'b'In Egypt, for instance, the military and security services actively undermined 'b'Mohamed Morsi'b', the country\xe2\x80\x99s democratically elected Islamist president, contributing to the upheaval that culminated in his ouster in a 2013 coup.'b'Turkey\xe2\x80\x99s president, 'b'Recep Tayyip Erdogan'b', has battled the deep state by consolidating power for himself and, after a failed coup attempt last year, conducting vast purges.'b'Though American democracy is resilient enough to resist such clashes, early hints of a conflict can be tricky to spot because some push and pull between a president and his or her agencies is normal.'b'In 2009, for instance, military officials used 'b'leaks'b' to pressure the White House over what it saw as the minimal number of troops necessary to send to Afghanistan.'b'Leaks can also be an emergency brake on policies that officials believe could be ill-advised or unlawful, such as George W. Bush-era programs on warrantless wiretapping and the Abu Ghraib detention facility in Iraq.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou want these people to be fighting like cats and dogs over what the best policy is, airing their views, making their case and then, when it\xe2\x80\x99s over, accepting the decision and implementing it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth N. Saunders, a George Washington University political scientist. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the way it\xe2\x80\x99s supposed to work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLeaking is not new,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this level of leaking is pretty unprecedented.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Institutional conflicts under Mr. Trump, she worried, had grown into something larger and more concerning.'b'Mr. Trump, apparently seeking to cut the intelligence community, State Department, and other agencies out of the policy-making process almost entirely, may have triggered a conflict whose escalation we are seeing in the rising number of leaks.'b'Officials, deprived of the usual levers for shaping policies that are supposed to be their purview, are left with little other than leaking. And the frenetic pace of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive orders, which the agencies would normally review internally over weeks or months, has them pulling that lever repeatedly.'b'They have leaked draft executive orders, inciting backlashes that led the orders to be shelved. And they have revealed administration efforts to circumvent usual policymaking channels, undermining Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enact his agenda.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s moves to consolidate power away from those agencies under his own authority also has them struggling to keep what they see as their crucial role in governance.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in a world now where the president is playing to the edge of his powers, and I think there are real concerns about the constitutional implications of some of the actions he\xe2\x80\x99s taken,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amy Zegart, the co-director of the Center for International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University.'b'That has forced officials in agencies to ask how far they will go themselves. As each side begins to perceive itself as under attack and the other as making dangerous power-grabs, it will justify more and more extreme behavior.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn President Trump, you have a president whose behavior shocks even more than the content of his policies,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. El Amrani said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was very much the case with Morsi,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, which led the civil service to \xe2\x80\x9cleak aggressively\xe2\x80\x9d to oppose Morsi\xe2\x80\x99s disregard for bureaucratic norms and procedures. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re seeing the same thing now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to treat each leak as an attack rather than an attempt to influence policy has created an atmosphere in Washington of open institutional conflict.'b'Some leaks appear motivated by more than mere policy disagreements, such as the revelations concerning conversations between 'b'Michael T. Flynn'b', the national security adviser, and Russia\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the United States, Sergey I. Kislyak, which led on Monday 'b'to Mr. Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s resignation'b'.'b'This came after months of worsening relations between Mr. Trump and the intelligence agencies, which he frequently criticized during his campaign.'b'Mr. Trump, in rejecting intelligence assessments that Russia intervened in the election to help him win, has risked implying that he will only accept intelligence bent to his political interests.'b'Mr. Trump has said he might appoint 'b'Stephen A. Feinberg'b', a finance executive who was an early supporter of his campaign, to review the intelligence agencies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt looks, sounds and feels like a political witch hunt,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Zegart. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like pouring gasoline on the fire.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening here is that the president doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even want to hear intelligence that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t agree with, and jumps to the conclusion that it must be politicized, and must be the result of people conspiring against him,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Zegart said.'b'By creating the perception of conflict, Mr. Trump may have made it more likely.'b'Mr. Flynn, in his short tenure, exemplified the breakdown between the president\xe2\x80\x99s inner circle and career civil servants. He kept the National Security Council largely shut out of policy-making and sought sweeping changes in foreign policy.'b'For concerned government officials, leaks may have become one of the few remaining means by which to influence not just Mr. Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s policy initiatives but the threat he seemed to pose to their place in democracy. That has fueled speculation that details of Mr. Flynn\xe2\x80\x99s contact with the Russian ambassador could have been leaked as much to undermine Mr. Flynn as out of concern for impropriety.'b'Even if that was not the case, such practices are a hazard of officials\xe2\x80\x99 growing reliance on leaks and other tools of bureaucratic resistance. This risks entrenching a culture of bureaucratic warfare that is adversarial and dysfunctional by default \xe2\x80\x94 not quite a Turkish-style deep state, but not a healthy democracy either.'b'Officials are stuck in a difficult position: Even if each individual leak is justifiable, as insubordination becomes more sustained and overt, it inches deeper into the gray zone of counter-democratic activities.'b'The distinction between deep-state meddling and acceptable protest is difficult to draw in the United States, Ms. Zegart said, because this degree of opposition is so unusual.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think you can say in advance what inappropriate deep-state activity would look like, because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen this before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'In countries like Egypt, Mr. El Amrani said, the line is much clearer.'b'There, \xe2\x80\x9cthe deep state is not official institutions rebelling,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, but rather \xe2\x80\x9cshadowy networks within those institutions, and within business, who are conspiring together and forming parallel state institutions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Trump, by treating these institutions as if they are already his political enemies, makes that harder to avoid.'b'As that gulf widens, it becomes more likely that mutual mistrust will lead the president and government bureaucracy to actively undermine one another.'b'A lesson of deep states: Even minor decisions become the subject of political infighting, making basic governance difficult. \xe2\x80\x9cWe saw in Egypt in 2013 that the result is complete decision-making paralysis,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. El Amrani said.'b'That is one of the milder outcomes. But when institutions with vast power to eavesdrop, fine, harass and detain see themselves as locked in a zero-sum struggle for survival, it is often basic civil liberties and democratic rights that end up in the crossfire.'b'Mr. El Amrani does not believe those worst-case scenarios are likely to come to pass in the United States. But there is still a risk that bureaucratic resistance against the president could become an enduring feature of American politics. Once trust is broken, it is difficult to rebuild.'b'Ms. Zegart agreed. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no good long-term consequences here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis war between the intelligence community and the White House is bad for the intelligence community, bad for the White House, and bad for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 Angry at the civilian casualties incurred last month in the 'b'first commando raid authorized by President Trump'b', 'b'Yemen'b' has withdrawn permission for the United States to run Special Operations ground missions against suspected terrorist groups in the country, according to American officials.'b'Grisly photographs of children apparently killed in the crossfire of a 50-minute firefight during the raid caused outrage in Yemen. A member of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s SEAL Team 6, Chief Petty Officer William Owens, was also killed in the operation.'b'While the White House continues to insist that the attack was a \xe2\x80\x9csuccess\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a characterization it repeated on Tuesday \xe2\x80\x94 the suspension of commando operations is a setback for Mr. Trump, who has made it clear he plans to take a far more aggressive approach against Islamic militants.'b'It also calls into question whether the Pentagon will receive permission from the president for far more autonomy in selecting and executing its counterterrorism missions in Yemen, which it sought, unsuccessfully, from President Barack Obama in the last months of his term.'b'Mr. Obama deferred the decision to Mr. Trump, who appeared inclined to grant it: His approval of the Jan. 29 raid came over a dinner four nights earlier with his top national security aides, rather than in the kind of rigorous review in the Situation Room that became fairly routine under President George W. Bush and Mr. Obama.'b'The raid, in which just about everything went wrong, was an early test of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s national security decision-making \xe2\x80\x94 and his willingness to rely on the assurances of his military advisers. His aides say that even though the decision was made over a dinner, it had been fully vetted, and had the requisite legal approvals.'b'Mr. Trump will soon have to make a decision about the more general request by the Pentagon to allow more of such operations in Yemen without detailed, and often time-consuming, White House review. It is unclear whether Mr. Trump will allow that, or how the series of mishaps that marked his first approval of such an operation may have altered his thinking about the human and political risks of similar operations.'b'The Pentagon has said that the main objective of the raid was to recover laptop computers, cellphones and other information that could help fill gaps in its understanding of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, whose leaders have tried to carry out at least three attacks on the United States. But it is unclear whether the information the commandos recovered will prove valuable.'b'The White House continued its defense of the raid on Tuesday, making no reference to the Yemeni reaction.'b'Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, denied reports that the purpose of the attack was to capture or kill any specific Qaeda leader. \xe2\x80\x9cThe raid that was conducted in Yemen was an intelligence-gathering raid,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what it was. It was highly successful. It achieved the purpose it was going to get, save the loss of life that we suffered and the injuries that occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Neither the White House nor the Yemenis have publicly announced the suspension. Pentagon spokesmen declined to comment, but other military and civilian officials confirmed that Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s reaction had been strong.'b'It was unclear if Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s decision to halt the ground attacks was also influenced by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of the country on his list of nations from which he wants to temporarily suspend all immigration, an executive order that is now being challenged in the federal courts.'b'According to American civilian and military officials, the Yemeni ban on operations does not extend to military 'b'drone attacks'b', and does not affect the handful of American military advisers who are providing intelligence support to the Yemenis and forces from the United Arab Emirates.'b'In 2014, Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s government temporarily halted those drones from flying because of botched operations that also killed civilians. But later they quietly resumed, and in recent years they have been increasing in frequency, a sign of the fact that Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP, is considered one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s most dangerous terrorist groups.'b'The raid stirred immediate outrage among Yemeni government officials, some of whom accused the Trump administration of not fully consulting with them before the mission. Within 24 hours of the assault on a cluster of houses in a tiny village in mountainous central Yemen, the country\xe2\x80\x99s foreign minister, Abdul Malik Al Mekhlafi, condemned the raid in a post on his official Twitter account as \xe2\x80\x9cextrajudicial killings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an interview with Al Jazeera this week, Ahmed Awad bin Mubarak, Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s ambassador to the United States, said that President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi raised concerns about the raid in a meeting with the American ambassador to Yemen in Riyadh on Feb. 2.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYemen\xe2\x80\x99s government is a key partner in the war against terrorism,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Mubarak 'b'said 'b'in the interview, adding that Yemen\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation should not come \xe2\x80\x9cat the expense of the Yemeni citizens and the country\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Pentagon has acknowledged that the raid killed several civilians, including children, and is investigating. The dead include, by the account of relatives, the 8-year-old daughter of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born Qaeda leader who was killed in a targeted drone strike in 2011.'b'In a sign of the contentiousness that public disclosures of the raid have caused, Pentagon officials on Tuesday provided lawmakers on Capitol Hill with a classified briefing on the mission. One participant in that meeting said military officials told them \xe2\x80\x9cthey got what they wanted,\xe2\x80\x9d without offering details. But Senator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said afterward that the raid was a failure.'b'American counterterrorism officials have expressed growing fears about their lack of understanding of Qaeda operations in Yemen since the United States was forced to withdraw the last 125 Special Operations advisers from the country in March 2015 after Houthi rebels ousted the government of President Hadi, the Americans\xe2\x80\x99 main counterterrorism partner.'b'The Pentagon has tried to start rebuilding its counterterrorism operations in Yemen since then. Last May, 'b'American Special Operations forces'b' helped Yemeni and Emirati troops evict Qaeda fighters from the port city of Al Mukalla.'b'Al Qaeda had used Al Mukalla as a base as the militants stormed through southern Yemen, capitalizing on the power vacuum caused by the country\xe2\x80\x99s 14-month civil war and seizing territory, weapons and money.'b'The deadly raid last month, launched from an amphibious assault ship off the Yemeni coast, was the first known American-led ground mission in Yemen since December 2014, when members of SEAL Team 6 stormed a village in southern Yemen in an effort to free an American photojournalist held hostage by Al Qaeda. But the raid ended with the kidnappers killing the journalist and a South African held with him.'b'The United States conducted 38 drone strikes in Yemen last year, up from 23 in 2014, and has already carried out five strikes so far this year, according to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\xe2\x80\x99 'b'Long War Journal'b'.'b'In response to the raid, Al Qaeda\xe2\x80\x99s branch in Yemen urged followers last weekend to attack the United States and its allies in the country.'b'Qasim al-Raymi, the leader of the Qaeda offshoot, likened his fighters to extremists battling American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to a speech translated by 'b'SITE Intelligence Group'b', which tracks extremist activities and messaging.'b'Specialists in Yemeni culture and politics have cautioned that Al Qaeda would seize on the raid to whip up anti-American feelings and attract more followers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe use of U.S. soldiers, high civilian casualties and disregard for local tribal and political dynamics,\xe2\x80\x9d the Brussels-based International Crisis Group said in a report released last Thursday, \xe2\x80\x9cplays into AQAP\xe2\x80\x99s narrative of defending Muslims against the West and could increase anti-U.S. sentiment and with it AQAP\xe2\x80\x99s pool of recruits.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'NAIROBI, Kenya \xe2\x80\x94 It started out in Washington.'b'Then it went to Jakarta. Then across Africa.'b'One version even showed up on Facebook.'b'Within hours, 'b'a 'b''b'State Department 'b''b'dissent cable'b', asserting that President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'executive order'b' to temporarily bar citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries would not make the nation safer, traveled like a chain letter \xe2\x80\x94 or a viral video.'b'The cable wended its way through dozens of American embassies around the world, quickly emerging as one of the broadest protests by American officials against their president\xe2\x80\x99s policies. And it is not over yet.'b'By 4 p.m. on Tuesday, the letter had attracted around 1,000 signatures, State Department officials said, far more than any dissent cable in recent years. It was being delivered to management, and department officials said more diplomats wanted to add their names to it.'b'The State Department has 7,600 Foreign Service officers and 11,000 civil servants.'b'The letter had been evolving since this weekend, when the first draft emerged. It was edited as it moved along, with some diplomats adding words and others striking out passages.'b'For example, one diplomat suggested this sentence should simply end on \xe2\x80\x9clasting shame\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThe decision to restrict the freedom of Japanese-Americans in the United States and foreign nationals who wanted to travel to or settle in the United States during the 1940s has been a source of lasting shame for many in our country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some officials who were trying to sign the document on Tuesday said it was not clear who was in charge or who was collecting signatures. The letter was passed through official State Department email accounts and on government time \xe2\x80\x94 several diplomats said union rules allowed them to work on dissent memos on the clock.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPolicy dissent is in our culture,\xe2\x80\x9d said one diplomat in Africa, who did not want to speak publicly before the letter was released. \xe2\x80\x9c'b'We even have awards for it'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The letter, which harshly took apart the executive order, said the visa ban would \xe2\x80\x9calienate allies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9churt America economically.\xe2\x80\x9d Foreign travelers inject nearly $250 billion into the American economy, the letter said, supporting more than one million jobs.'b'Some diplomats said they joined the dissent by sending an email saying \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m in\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPlease add my name as a signer\xe2\x80\x9d along with their full name, title, position and post.'b'The letter was apparently circulated through informal networks of diplomats and not through any State Department-wide email list. One diplomat on vacation in the United States said he received the letter from a colleague in another part of the world who was not connected to the drafters and was simply passing it along.'b'The diplomat predicted that hundreds of other diplomats would be eager to sign it if they could, but because of the complications of figuring out where the dissent memo originally came from, he was not sure how many would actually sign it.'b'Most people in the State Department have never seen anything like this, the diplomat said. He said dissent memos were reserved for major policy issues, not for little grumbles like bad food in the embassy cafeteria.'b'That diplomat also requested anonymity, saying that Foreign Service officers were not supposed to criticize American policy publicly and that he did not want to open himself up to accusations that he had violated the rules. That could threaten his job, he said, especially in such a polarized environment.'b'This is exactly what the dissent channel, as it is called, was intended for.'b'Starting in 1971 during the Vietnam War, the channel encourages department officials to voice their criticisms internally through a process of sending a memo or a cable to the secretary of state expressing their concerns and suggesting solutions. The final part of the visa ban memo lays out detailed alternatives, including increased vetting for specific nationalities.'b'State Department rules are supposed to protect dissenters from being retaliated against, and last year several dozen diplomats 'b'signed a dissent memo'b' criticizing American policy on Syria.'b'But however officially tolerated, several veteran diplomats said dissent was still risky. When it comes to ambassadorships, the selection process is highly competitive \xe2\x80\x94 and highly subjective \xe2\x80\x94 and the diplomats said it would be impossible to prove why someone had been blocked from a coveted post. Previous dissent could easily be used against the person.'b'Some State Department officials said on Tuesday that they would not sign the letter because of those risks. While one said he disagreed with the visa ban, he considered it his job to enforce American government policies whether or not he agreed with them.'b'Other diplomats said the letter did not mean that dissenters would disobey the visa ban. The intent was to try to change the policy so the ban would be lifted, they said.'b'The diplomat who said he would not use a dissent memo to complain about cafeteria food said that he had been torn when the United States invaded Iraq because he was strongly against the war, but that he did not know how to express his concern.'b'He said he was just starting out at the time.'b'The visa ban, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas such obviously bad policy\xe2\x80\x9d that he was trying to find a way to sign the dissent letter.'b'He also said that many diplomats were using the letter as a vehicle to express broader concerns about the way the Trump administration has appeared to sideline the State Department.'b'The diplomat spoke in defense of refugees, saying that the tiny percentage from, say, Somalia who had been approved for resettlement in the United States had been scrutinized by several agencies and were among the most vulnerable of very vulnerable people. Now, many are stuck in limbo in transit centers.'b'The diplomat also criticized Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s press secretary, Sean Spicer, who said on Monday that State Department officials who did not agree with Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s agenda \xe2\x80\x9cshould either 'b'get with the program or they can go'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He called that \xe2\x80\x9cbullying at the highest levels.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'MOSCOW \xe2\x80\x94 Aleksandr B. Vyarya thought his job was to defend people from cyberattacks \xe2\x80\x94 until, he says, his government approached him with a request to do the opposite.'b'Mr. Vyarya, 33, a bearded, bespectacled computer programmer who thwarted hackers, said he was suddenly being asked to join a sweeping overhaul of the Russian military last year. Under a new doctrine, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s generals were redefining war as more than a contest of steel and gunpowder, making 'b'cyberwarfare'b' a central tenet in expanding the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s interests.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSorry, I can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vyarya said he told an executive at a Russian military contracting firm who had offered him the hacking job. But Mr. Vyarya was worried about the consequences of his refusal, so he abruptly fled to Finland last year, he and his former employer said. It was a rare example of a Russian who sought asylum in the face of the country\xe2\x80\x99s push to recruit hackers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is against my principles \xe2\x80\x94 and illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the Russian military\xe2\x80\x99s hacking effort.'b'While much about 'b'Russia'b'\xe2\x80\x99s cyberwarfare program is shrouded in secrecy, details of the government\xe2\x80\x99s effort to recruit programmers in recent years \xe2\x80\x94 whether professionals like Mr. Vyarya, college students, or even criminals \xe2\x80\x94 are shedding some light on the Kremlin\xe2\x80\x99s plan to create elite teams of computer hackers.'b'American intelligence agencies say that a 'b'team of Russian hackers'b' stole data from the Democratic National Committee during the presidential campaign. On Thursday, the Obama administration imposed sanctions against Russia for interfering in the election, the bedrock of the American political system.'b'The sanctions take aim at Russia\xe2\x80\x99s main intelligence agencies and specific individuals, striking at one part of a sprawling cyberespionage operation that also includes the military, military contractors and teams of civilian recruits.'b'For more than three years, rather than rely on military officers working out of isolated bunkers, Russian government recruiters have scouted a wide range of programmers, placing prominent ads on social media sites, offering jobs to college students and professional coders, and even speaking openly about looking in Russia\xe2\x80\x99s criminal underworld for potential talent.'b'Those recruits were intended to cycle through military contracting companies and newly formed units called science squadrons established on military bases around the country.'b'As early as 2013, Sergei K. Shoigu, the Russian defense minister, told university rectors at a meeting in Moscow that he was on a \xe2\x80\x9chead hunt in the positive meaning of the word\xe2\x80\x9d for coders.'b'The Defense Ministry bought advertising on 'b'Vkontakte'b', Russia\xe2\x80\x99s most popular social network. One 'b'video'b' shows a man clanging a military rifle on a table beside a laptop computer, then starting to type.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you graduated from college, if you are a technical specialist, if you are ready to use your knowledge, we give you an opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d the ad intoned. Members of the science squadrons, the video said, live in \xe2\x80\x9ccomfortable accommodation,\xe2\x80\x9d shown as an apartment furnished with a washing machine.'b'University students subject to mandatory conscription in the nation\xe2\x80\x99s armed forces, but who wanted to avoid brutal stints as enlistees, 'b'could opt'b' instead to join a science squadron. A government questionnaire asks draftees about their knowledge of programming languages.'b'The ministry posted openings on job forums, according to an investigation by 'b'Meduza'b', a Russian news site based in Riga, Latvia, that first disclosed the recruitment effort. One post from 2014 advertised for a computer scientist with knowledge of \xe2\x80\x9cpatches, vulnerabilities and 'b'exploits'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which refers to sabotage used to alter a computer.'b'Given the size of Russia\xe2\x80\x99s cybercrime underworld, it was not long before the military considered recruiting those it described as \xe2\x80\x9chackers who have problems with the law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In an article titled \xe2\x80\x9cEnlisted Hacker\xe2\x80\x9d in Rossiiskaya Gazeta, the government newspaper, a deputy minister of defense, Gen. Oleg Ostapenko, said the science squadrons might include hackers with criminal histories. \xe2\x80\x9cFrom the point of view of using scientific potential, this is a matter for discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d he was quoted as saying in 2013.'b'Experts say the strategy was more than just talk.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been cases where cybercriminals are arrested but never ended up in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dmitri Alperovitch, the co-founder and chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, the cybersecurity company that first identified the group known as Fancy Bear as the perpetrator of the Democratic National Committee hacking.'b'Mr. Vyarya, the programmer who turned down the government\xe2\x80\x99s job offer, was an attractive recruit from the opposite end of the spectrum: someone with a career protecting people against hackers.'b'Specifically, he had experience shielding websites from a maneuver called a distributed denial of service, or DDoS attack, in which the sites are overwhelmed and disabled by a torrent of fake traffic. Among his clients were Vedomosti, an independent newspaper; TV Rain, an opposition-leaning television station; and the website of Aleksei A. Navalny, the opposition leader.'b'Mr. Vyarya said that in 2015 he was invited to accompany Vasily Brovko, an executive at the military contracting company Rostec, on a trip to Sofia, Bulgaria. But he said it turned out to be a demonstration of a new software suite capable of staging DDoS attacks.'b'The Bulgarian firm demonstrating the software briefly crashed the website of Ukraine\xe2\x80\x99s Defense Ministry and 'b'Slon.ru'b', a Russian news website, Mr. Vyarya said. Slon.ru has confirmed its site went down inexplicably for about two minutes that day, Feb. 5, 2015.'b'After the demonstration, Mr. Vyarya said Mr. Brovko asked him how the program might be improved. Then, according to Mr. Vyarya, Mr. Brovko offered him a job running the DDoS software, which he said the Russians planned to buy from the Bulgarians for about $1 million.'b'Mr. Vyarya said his problems began when he turned down the offer: He was surveilled, and an acquaintance in law enforcement advised him to flee the country. He left in August 2015 for Finland to seek asylum, he and his former employer said. The Finnish government, citing safety and privacy concerns, would not comment on the asylum application.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs soon as we saw what was on the table, Sasha was given direct instructions to return to his hotel and stop all contacts,\xe2\x80\x9d said his former boss, Aleksandr V. Lyamin of Qrator, a cyberdefense company in Moscow, using Mr. Vyarya\xe2\x80\x99s Russian nickname. But the overtures from the military contractor persisted, Mr. Lyamin said, and Mr. Vyarya fled.'b'Rostec strongly denied Mr. Vyarya\xe2\x80\x99s account. Mr. Brovko did travel to Bulgaria with Mr. Vyarya, the company said, but to evaluate software for defensive, not offensive, cybersystems. A spokeswoman for Mr. Brovko called the account of crashing sites in a product demonstration the imagination of a \xe2\x80\x9cmentally unstable\xe2\x80\x9d man.'b'The military\xe2\x80\x99s push into cyberwarfare had intensified in 2012, with the appointment of a new minister of defense, Mr. Shoigu. The next year, a senior defense official, Gen. Valery V. Gerasimov published what became known as the Gerasimov Doctrine. It posited that in the world today, the lines between war and peace had blurred and that covert tactics, such as working through proxies or otherwise in the shadows, would rise in importance.'b'He called it \xe2\x80\x9cnonlinear war.\xe2\x80\x9d His critics called it \xe2\x80\x9cguerrilla geopolitics.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Russia is certainly not alone.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlmost all developed countries in the world, unfortunately, are creating offensive capabilities, and many have confirmed this,\xe2\x80\x9d said Anton M. Shingarev, a vice president at Kaspersky, a Russian antivirus company.'b'Recruitment by Russia\xe2\x80\x99s military should be expected, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou or I might be angry about it, but, unfortunately, it\xe2\x80\x99s just reality. Many countries are doing it. This is the reality.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'American intelligence agencies, including the National Security Agency, have for decades recruited on college campuses. In 2015, the N.S.A. offered a 'b'free summer camp'b' to 1,400 high school and middle school students, where they were taught the basics of hacking, cracking and cyberdefense.'b'In Russia, recruiters have looked well beyond the nation\xe2\x80\x99s school system.'b'In 2013, as Russia\xe2\x80\x99s recruitment drive was picking up, 'b'Dmitry A. Artimovich'b', a soft-spoken physicist, was awaiting trial in a Moscow jail for designing a computer program that spammed email users with advertisements for male sexual enhancement products.'b'One day a cellmate, who had been convicted of selling narcotics online, sidled up to him with some news. The cellmate said that people incarcerated for cybercrimes could get out before trial, in exchange for working for the government. Another inmate had already taken a deal, he said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an offer to cooperate,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Artimovich said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy else would you work for the government?\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThe salaries are tiny. But if you do something illegal, and go to prison for eight or nine years, the F.S.B. can help you,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, using a Russian abbreviation for the Federal Security Service.'b'Mr. Artimovich said he decided to take his chances at trial, and served a year in a penal colony.'b'As Russia ramped up its abilities, government agencies were also in the market for surveillance and hacking software, including some from legal suppliers in the West.'b'In 2014, a Russian company called Advanced Monitoring that has a license to work with the F.S.B., the agency that succeeded the K.G.B. after the fall of the Soviet Union, bought iPhone hacking software from an Italian company called 'b'Hacking Team'b', according to invoices published by WikiLeaks. Hacking Team has since lost its export license.'b'Western cybersecurity analysts believe they have identified the one responsible for the breaching the Democratic National Committee: a group nicknamed Fancy Bear.'b'First known as Advanced Persistent Threat 28, the group has been active since 2007 but its abilities evolved to emphasize attacks, rather than gather intelligence, after the military placed a priority on cyberwarfare.'b'It stepped up \xe2\x80\x9cfaketivist\xe2\x80\x9d actions that released stolen data through contrived online personalities like Guccifer 2 and websites like DCLeaks, according to Kyle Ehmke, a senior intelligence researcher at ThreatConnect, a cybersecurity company. The group had been called Pawn Storm, named for a chess maneuver. It was nicknamed Fancy Bear in 2014.'b'This year, the group appropriated the nickname for its own use, setting up the website 'b'fancybear.net'b' and publishing hacked data from the World Anti-Doping Agency, which showed that many American athletes, including the American tennis star Serena Williams, had medical exemptions to take banned substances. The hacking was apparently in retaliation for revelations of Russian doping in sports.'b'President 'b'Vladimir V. Putin'b' has said repeatedly, most recently at his annual 'b'year-end 'b''b'news conference'b', that the information released in the recent hacking of the Democratic National Committee was more important than who was behind them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe main thing, to my mind, is the information the hackers provided,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Putin said of this summer\xe2\x80\x99s cyberattack.'b'Democratic Party members and the Obama administration should not look abroad for someone to blame for losing the election, Mr. Putin said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou need to learn how to lose gracefully,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 President Trump jettisoned two decades of diplomatic orthodoxy on Wednesday by declaring that the United States would no longer insist on the creation of a 'b'Palestinian'b' state as part of a peace accord between 'b'Israel'b' and the Palestinians.'b'Hosting Prime Minister 'b'Benjamin Netanyahu'b' of Israel for the first time since becoming president, Mr. Trump promised a concerted effort to bring the two sides together, suggesting 'b'a regional effort'b' involving an array of Arab nations. But he said that he was flexible about how an agreement would look and that he would not be bound by past assumptions.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m looking at two-state and one-state\xe2\x80\x9d formulations, Mr. Trump said during a White House news conference with Mr. Netanyahu. \xe2\x80\x9cI like the one that both parties like. I\xe2\x80\x99m very happy with the one that both parties like. I can live with either one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the same time, Mr. Trump urged Mr. Netanyahu to temporarily stop new housing construction in the West Bank while he pursues a deal, echoing a position past presidents have taken. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Mr. Netanyahu.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s position on a two-state solution discarded a policy that has underpinned America\xe2\x80\x99s role in Middle East peacemaking since the Clinton administration and raised a host of thorny questions.'b'The Palestinians are highly unlikely to accept anything short of a sovereign state, and a single Israeli state encompassing the Palestinians would either leave them as second-class citizens or would no longer be majority Jewish, given the growth rate of the Arab population.'b'Still, long before Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ascension, momentum for side-by-side states had faded not just in Washington but also in the Middle East, where many Israelis and Palestinians have given up hope or changed their minds about the concept. The leaders of both sides face domestic difficulties and seem unenthusiastic about the compromises that might be required to get to a mutually agreeable resolution.'b'The trick is that no one has offered a plausible alternative that would satisfy both camps, leaving the conflict in a state of suspended animation. Mr. Netanyahu is under pressure from his right-leaning coalition to abandon the two-state solution and even annex parts of the West Bank. And the Palestinian Authority faces pressure from Hamas, the militant group that controls Gaza and is sworn to Israel\xe2\x80\x99s destruction.'b'Mr. Trump did not address these dynamics, instead emphasizing his confidence that he could produce a breakthrough. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re going to make a deal,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, describing that as personally important to him. \xe2\x80\x9cIt might be a bigger and better deal than people in this room even understand.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He emphasized that Israel would have to be flexible in any future talks. \xe2\x80\x9cAs with any successful negotiation, both sides will have to make compromises,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump said.'b'Turning to Mr. Netanyahu, he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know that, right?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Netanyahu responded with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cBoth sides,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, emphasizing the first word.'b'Nonetheless, Mr. Netanyahu, who nominally supports a two-state solution, quickly embraced Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s declaration, saying he preferred to deal with the \xe2\x80\x9csubstance\xe2\x80\x9d of a deal rather than \xe2\x80\x9clabels.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He noted that the concept of a two-state solution meant different things to different people. And he repeated his two prerequisites: that the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state and that Israel maintain security control over the entire West Bank. He said the obstacle to peace was Palestinian hatred, demonstrated by the building of statues to those who carry out terrorist attacks and the payment of salaries to their families. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the source of the conflict,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of the two-state solution seemed reminiscent of 'b'his remark during the transition'b' that the United States should not be bound by the decades-old \xe2\x80\x9cone China\xe2\x80\x9d policy that recognizes a single Chinese government in Beijing and withholds diplomatic ties from Taiwan. That statement infuriated the Chinese leadership, and Mr. Trump eventually circled back 'b'to endorse the policy'b'.'b'If Mr. Trump is serious about pursuing peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, several analysts said, he may inevitably find his way back to the two-state solution.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you do a systematic analysis of the situation, there is no other option,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former United States ambassador to Israel and Egypt. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are Israelis who believe they could get away with giving the Palestinians minimal political rights, but they are fooling themselves. Unless the Palestinians do a 180, it is just inconceivable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Palestinian leaders lamented Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s stance, seeing it as an abandonment by the United States, which has been the main patron of the Palestinian Authority. But 'b'Ghaith al-Omari'b', a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said Palestinians could draw comfort from Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s eagerness for a new peace push and his warning to Israel on settlements.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey will see an opening in, how do you translate the president\xe2\x80\x99s desire for peace into something concrete?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Omari said.'b'Mr. Trump and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, have been 'b'exploring an approach'b' called the \xe2\x80\x9coutside-in\xe2\x80\x9d strategy, which involves enlisting Arab nations that have already found common cause with Israel against Iran, their mutual enemy, to help broker a settlement with the Palestinians.'b'Until now, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s team has largely avoided conversations with Palestinian leaders. But Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director, met with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian Authority president, in Ramallah in the West Bank on Tuesday, according to news reports.'b'The idea of an independent Palestinian state comprising the West Bank and Gaza became the central theme of Middle East peacemaking in the 1990s after the Oslo Accords were signed. Bill Clinton was the first president to endorse a two-state solution, saying in a speech in January 2001, just two weeks before leaving office, that the conflict would never be settled without \xe2\x80\x9ca sovereign, viable Palestinian state.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His successor, George W. Bush, picked that up later that year, becoming the first president to make it official American policy. Barack Obama considered a two-state solution the unquestionable bedrock of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s approach. But those presidents never got to the point of an agreement between the two parties, and Mr. Trump picked as his ambassador to Israel a lawyer, David M. Friedman, 'b'who opposes the two-state solution'b'.'b'Mr. Netanyahu looked forward to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s inauguration as the first time in his four terms as prime minister that he would have a Republican president as a partner. After years of tension with Mr. Obama, who pressed Israel for more concessions for peace, Mr. Netanyahu anticipated vigorous support from the new president.'b'But Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the Palestinian conflict and his push for a pause in settlements distracted from the topic Mr. Netanyahu preferred to address, the threat from Iran. At the news conference, Mr. Trump again called Mr. Obama\xe2\x80\x99s nuclear agreement with Iran \xe2\x80\x9cone of the worst deals I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen,\xe2\x80\x9d but said nothing about abandoning it or even renegotiating it. Instead, he simply vowed to keep Iran from becoming a nuclear power. \xe2\x80\x9cI will do more to prevent Iran from ever developing \xe2\x80\x94 I mean ever \xe2\x80\x94 a nuclear weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Nor did he repeat his campaign vow to move the American Embassy to Jerusalem, saying only, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d love to see that happen\xe2\x80\x9d and, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But he made a show of warmly welcoming Mr. Netanyahu, even inviting the prime minister\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Sara, to stand during the news conference. The Israeli first lady was then treated to a museum tour by Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s wife, Melania.'b'Still, the president was pressed by an Israeli reporter about a rise in anti-Semitic attacks across the country since his election. The reporter asked what he would say to those \xe2\x80\x9cwho believe and feel that your administration is playing with xenophobia and maybe racist tones.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a meandering response, Mr. Trump cited his victory in the Electoral College, then promised \xe2\x80\x9cto do everything within our power to stop long-simmering racism.\xe2\x80\x9d He pointed to Mr. Kushner, who is Jewish, and his daughter Ivanka, who converted when she married Mr. Kushner, to dispel suggestions of anti-Semitism.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as Jewish people, so many friends \xe2\x80\x94 a daughter who happens to be here right now, a son-in-law and three beautiful grandchildren,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, vowing to promote comity. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re going to see a lot of love.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'TORONTO \xe2\x80\x94 Fran\xc3\xa7ois Deschamps stepped out of his apartment building in the Limoilou neighborhood of Quebec City recently and stopped when he saw a sticker wrapped around a light pole.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBurn Your Local Mosque,\xe2\x80\x9d it read, around a silhouette of a Turkish-style mosque against an orange flame. He snapped a cellphone photo and added it to his collection of anti-Muslim propaganda popping up around the city.'b''b'Canada'b' is a remarkably open society, a legacy of liberal politicians who set the thinly populated country on the path of aggressive multiculturalism decades ago. Last week, 'b'Statistics Canada'b' reported that by 2036, nearly half of all Canadians would be immigrants or the children of immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 most of them what the country calls \xe2\x80\x9cvisible minorities,\xe2\x80\x9d which means nonwhite.'b'That rapid transformation is stirring the most conservative elements of the white Canadian population, who see the country as their own, despite the fact that Europeans took the land from a patchwork of indigenous peoples who had long existed there.'b'Few people believe that this stirring, which is moderate by United States standards, contributed directly the shooting Sunday inside Quebec City\xe2\x80\x99s largest mosque, in which six worshipers were killed and eight injured. And no evidence yet has emerged that the accused assailant, a Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois university student, had ties to specific groups. But the attack has put many on guard that Canada\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of Muslim immigration is raising tensions. Even the most radical groups seem to sense that expressing extreme views can be dangerous.'b'There are at least 100 right-wing extremist groups in Canada, according to two Canadian studies published last year, with most of them active in the provinces of Ontario, Quebec, Alberta and British Columbia.'b'While their targets include gays and lesbians, Jews and other minorities, Muslims have faced a sizable amount of the hostility. In 2014, the last year for which statistics are available, Canadian police forces recorded 99 religiously motivated hate crimes against Muslims \xe2\x80\x94 up from 45 in 2012, according to Statistics Canada.'b'Some critics have blamed Donald J. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s nationalistic language, but right-wing extremism has long thrived in Canada among skinheads, white supremacists and others, said Barbara Perry, a global hate crime expert at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology in Oshawa, Ontario, and the lead author of a report published last year in the journal Studies in Conflict &amp; Terrorism.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of that sentiment has been there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Perry, who said the internet has helped spread the ideology.'b'Canada has witnessed a flurry of nationalist groups proliferating in recent years, including the Soldiers of Odin, a white nationalist group that began in Finland. While the Canadian group has denied racist beliefs and members have participated in community foot patrols in cities like Edmonton and Vancouver, its main Canada Facebook page has anti-Muslim screeds and derogatory references to immigrants.'b'The Canadian authorities have recorded thousands of hate-motivated crimes in recent years, but Ms. Perry said Canadian law enforcement officials have played down the threat of right-wing extremists, preferring instead to focus on Islamic terrorism. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s where all the money and attention goes,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cLaw enforcement officers in communities with a fairly well known right-wing presence, they either denied they were there or that it was an issue.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the Canadian Security Intelligence Service declined to comment on actions they have taken to monitor and stop the spread of white nationalist groups, though the intelligence service has in the past minimized the movement\xe2\x80\x99s influence, telling the Canadian news media that \xe2\x80\x9cright-wing extremist circles appear to be fragmented and primarily pose a threat to public order and not to national security.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Anti-racism activists and others opposed to such views say the government has not done enough to protect vulnerable groups. In 2013, Prime Minister Stephen Harper\xe2\x80\x99s government repealed hate speech provisions in the Canadian Human Rights Act, which supporters said hindered free speech. A federal court ruled that the provisions did not violate freedom of expression, but they have not been reinstated.'b'Daniel Gallant, a former white supremacist from Vancouver who changed his views 15 years ago and is now a social worker and a law student, said widespread Canadian denial about the prevalence of right-wing extremism was a major problem. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'A 2016 telephone survey by the Canadian polling firm Forum Research found that in a random sampling of 1,304 Canadians, Muslims were the focus of the most animosity in Quebec, where 48 percent of respondents expressed dislike of the religion.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear from these findings that respondents in Quebec are the most likely to hold unfavorable feelings towards Jewish and Muslim people,\xe2\x80\x9d said the firm\xe2\x80\x99s president, Lorne Bozinoff.'b'Nowhere have those elements been as vocal as Quebec City.'b'Handbills, posters and occasional demonstrations by such groups as the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration des Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois de Souche (which translates roughly as \xe2\x80\x9cpeople of original Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois stock\xe2\x80\x9d) have proliferated in the city. Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois de Souche\xe2\x80\x99s slogan is \xe2\x80\x9cI exist, so I act,\xe2\x80\x9d but as with fringe movements everywhere, it and other groups are most active behind the anonymity of the internet.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to know their numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d said St\xc3\xa9phane Leman-Langlois, a sociology professor at Laval University who studies Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s far right, adding that there is a small core to each group and that the followers are less active. He said the movement has fragmented and re-formed and groups have changed names for the past 20 years, although the recent surge in immigration has strengthened their cause. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a new thing,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'La Meute, a group that includes many Afghanistan war veterans, has gathered about 43,000 followers since it started a closed Facebook page last year. The name means \xe2\x80\x9cwolf pack\xe2\x80\x9d in French, and its members are not politically virulent by United States standards but focus on concerns about Muslim immigration.'b'At the other end of the scale are followers of L\xc3\xa9gitime Violence, a proudly fascist heavy metal band that announces its concerts to a vetted list of fans and performs songs like \xe2\x80\x9cFinal Solution,\xe2\x80\x9d which is as subtle as it sounds.'b'Other extremist groups in Quebec include Atalante Qu\xc3\xa9bec; Pegida Qu\xc3\xa9bec, which is an offshoot of a German group; and Soldiers of Odin.'b'Calling these groups \xe2\x80\x9cfar right\xe2\x80\x9d may be a misnomer. The F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration des Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois de Souche says its members include people with different political beliefs, including socialists and libertarians. The common denominator is an opposition to immigration, particularly by Muslims.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur objective is not to shrink to a minority,\xe2\x80\x9d said R\xc3\xa9mi Tremblay, spokesman for the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration des Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois de Souche. He says groups like his have helped to start a debate about immigration and multiculturalism that was \xe2\x80\x9cunthinkable\xe2\x80\x9d when the group formed 10 years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to free the tongues of the people so they start thinking about this without the constraints of political correctness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'That conversation among largely anonymous anti-immigration extremists exists in the broader context of a right-leaning talk radio culture in Quebec that has been critical of Muslim immigration and what it sees as a failure by Muslims to assimilate into Canadian culture. Talk radio of this stripe is rare elsewhere in Canada and is reminiscent, albeit far more mild, of the raucous right-wing shows in the United States.'b'The radio stations Radio X and FM93 are among those cited as giving voice to anti-Muslim activists. While their own commentary may be muted, they give a platform to less-tolerant voices from sites like Point de Bascule, which means Tipping Point, and Poste de Veille, which translates roughly as \xe2\x80\x9cWatchtower\xe2\x80\x9d and whose website shows a pirate ship with a jihadist flag as its sail approaching Quebec City.'b'One popular conspiracy theory links Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to the Muslim Brotherhood, a pan-Arab group that supports the application of Islamic law in Muslim communities.'b'Even Quebec City\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, R\xc3\xa9gis Labeaume, who was visibly moved at a news conference on Monday while showing support for the Muslim community, has expressed frustration with some orthodox Muslim customs.'b'In 2014, during interviews about the appearance of the \xe2\x80\x9cburkini\xe2\x80\x9d at community pools, he recalled one extremely hot summer day seeing a man dressed in shorts and sandals while his wife was wearing a full niqab \xe2\x80\x94 head-to-toe covering including black gloves. Mayor Labeaume said his own wife had to hold him back from insulting the man and \xe2\x80\x9cripping his head off.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many people have called for toning down the talk in the wake of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s mosque shooting in a suburb of Quebec City by a professed immigration opponent.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe tone should definitely be more respectful on all sides,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dominic Maurais, who hosts a show on Radio X and is a leading voice of Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s conservative talk shows. Mr. Maurais noted that he was pro-immigration.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we should all be careful about letting political correctness win over crucial, frank and essential discussions about radical Islam and Islamic values in our democracies,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a telephone interview.'b'The F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration des Qu\xc3\xa9b\xc3\xa9cois de Souche and Atalante Qu\xc3\xa9bec issued a joint statement deploring the violence and calling the gunman deranged.'b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 The 'b'European Union'b' is accustomed to crises. But it is probably safe to say that none of the 28 leaders who are gathering in Malta on Friday expected the crisis that has overtaken the agenda: the United States of America.'b'Like much of the world, the European Union is 'b'struggling to decipher a President Trump'b' who seems every day to be picking a new fight with a new nation, whether friend or foe. Hopes among European leaders that Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s bombastic tone as a candidate would somehow smooth into a more temperate one as commander in chief are dissipating, replaced by a mounting sense of anxiety and puzzlement over how to proceed.'b'If many foreign leaders expected a Trump administration to push to renegotiate trade deals, or take a tough line on immigration, few anticipated that he would become an equal opportunity offender. He has 'b'insulted or humiliated Mexico'b', Britain, Germany and Iraq; engaged in a war of words with China 'b'and Iran'b'; and turned a routine phone call with the prime minister of Australia, a staunch ally, into 'b'a minor diplomatic crisis'b'.'b'With 'b'the possible exception of NATO'b', where he has softened his tone, Mr. Trump has expressed disdain for other multilateral institutions such as the European Union. His praise has been reserved for populists and strongmen, like Nigel Farage, the former leader of the U.K. Independence Party, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines and, of course, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.'b'Mr. Trump is convinced that the United States has been played for a patsy by the rest of the world and is vowing to set things straight. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re taken advantage of by every nation in the world virtually,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on Thursday at a prayer breakfast. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen anymore.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Against this forbidding backdrop, some European leaders are urging their counterparts to recognize that Mr. Trump may represent a truly dire challenge, one that threatens to upend not only the 70-year European project of integration and security, but just about everything they stand for, including liberal democracy itself.'b'A European official, Donald Tusk, created a stir this week when he wrote 'b'a letter'b' to 27 leaders of the bloc\xe2\x80\x99s 28 member states suggesting that the Trump administration presented a threat on a par with a newly assertive China, an aggressive Russia and \xe2\x80\x9cwars, terror and anarchy in the Middle East and Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Intentionally, he left out Britain, because it has voted to leave the bloc and its prime minister, Theresa May, has rushed with what some Europeans consider unseemly rapidity to the side of Mr. Trump, who has derided the European Union and praised Britain\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal, or \xe2\x80\x9cBrexit,\xe2\x80\x9d saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think it matters much for the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In his letter, Mr. Tusk, a former Polish prime minister who is the president of the European Council, made up of the national leaders,'b' wrote of \xe2\x80\x9cworrying declarations\xe2\x80\x9d from the Trump team'b', adding: \xe2\x80\x9cParticularly the change in Washington puts the European Union in a difficult situation, with the new administration seeming to put into question the last 70 years of American foreign policy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Stefano Stefanini, a former Italian ambassador working in Brussels, said that Mr. Tusk \xe2\x80\x9cis prone to exaggeration\xe2\x80\x9d and that he had a specific Polish fear of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s apparent coziness with Mr. Putin.'b'But Mr. Tusk \xe2\x80\x9chas some justification,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stefanini said, because he is also reacting to a complacent Brussels establishment \xe2\x80\x9cthat he believes is shrugging off Brexit, Trump and right-wing populism and believes it\xe2\x80\x99s business as usual.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Others say Mr. Tusk is adapting realistically to a series of new dangers posed by the new administration in Washington. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s open 'b'protectionism'b', his contempt for the European Union and his ambivalence toward 'b'NATO'b' are serious and damaging, which Mr. Tusk understands, said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrump is the first American president since the E.U. was created not to be in favor of deeper European integration,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Leonard said. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only that, but he\xe2\x80\x99s against it and sees the destruction of the European Union as in America\xe2\x80\x99s interest.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Worse, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cEuropeans see Trump as the biggest threat to global order and the European ideal of how the world should be organized. The U.S. has been a crucial part of the ballast meant to be upholding the global order in the face of these other challenges Tusk mentions, from Russia and China to Islamic radicalism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut rather than acting as a check on these forces, Trump seems to be amplifying them, and that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty terrifying,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Leonard continued. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like you suddenly discover that the medicine you\xe2\x80\x99ve been taking is making you sicker than the illness itself.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For his part, Mr. Trump described his confrontational diplomatic style as a necessity. \xe2\x80\x9cThe world is in trouble, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to straighten it out, O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said at the prayer breakfast on Thursday'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I do \xe2\x80\x94 I fix things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, when you hear about the tough phone calls I\xe2\x80\x99m having, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There have been other moments when Europeans judged American policies as harmful, including the Iraq war and the assaults on multilateralism early in the first term of President George W. Bush. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Trump\xe2\x80\x99s attacks are of a different scale and come when there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of indigenous turmoil anyway,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Leonard said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe seems to be linking up with some of the scariest and darkest forces within European societies,\xe2\x80\x9d which all want the European Union to fail, he said.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s views about Europe and his reluctance to commit to summit meetings with the European Union or even with NATO are deeply troubling for Europeans, said Leslie Vinjamuri, a professor of international relations at London\xe2\x80\x99s School of Oriental and African Studies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s strategy towards Europe has always been highly consequential, but up until now that strategy has been aimed at bolstering Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The United States has provided \xe2\x80\x9cthat overarching protection and alliance that underpins the whole thing and makes it work,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut dealing with Russia and China is suddenly a whole different calculus if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have America behind you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Then there is Germany and the euro. Traditionally, Europeans view Germany as the bulwark of the European Union, its largest, richest and most influential country, but uncomfortable with open leadership. Chancellor 'b'Angela Merkel'b' of Germany, up for re-election this autumn, is viewed as practical, pragmatic and devoted to the European project, and Germans see the euro as a political sacrifice they made of the revered deutsche mark to please the French.'b'So they deeply resent Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s attacks on Ms. Merkel for her refugee policy and his statements that the European Union itself is a \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle\xe2\x80\x9d for German self-interest. Ms. Merkel was angry over comments by Peter Navarro, the director of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s new National Trade Council, that Germany was manipulating a \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly undervalued\xe2\x80\x9d euro to gain trade advantages over other Europeans and the United States.'b'While Germany depends heavily on exports, annoying some of its neighbors, the value of the euro is the same for all that use it, and Ms. Merkel made clear that its value was up to the European Central Bank, not Berlin. But a protectionist America that opposes free trade is certainly unhelpful to Germany.'b'Added to that are the comments by Ted Malloch, who has been advertising himself as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s top choice to succeed Anthony L. Gardner as ambassador to the European Union. Mr. Malloch, a strong supporter of Britain leaving the bloc, has publicly 'b'said'b' that Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x9cdoesn\xe2\x80\x99t like an organization that is supranational, that is unelected, where the bureaucrats run amok, and is not frankly a proper democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Malloch has also referred to Jean-Claude Juncker, the European Commission president, as \xe2\x80\x9ca very adequate mayor of some city in Luxembourg,\xe2\x80\x9d predicted that the euro would collapse and compared the bloc to the Soviet Union. \xe2\x80\x9cI had in a previous career a diplomatic post where I helped bring down the Soviet Union,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on British television. \xe2\x80\x9cSo maybe there\xe2\x80\x99s another union that needs a little taming.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Malloch may not get nominated, and if he does, the bloc may not accept his posting, Mr. Gardner said.'b'Mr. Trump is \xe2\x80\x9cgetting advice that is a caricature of the E.U. as a dysfunctional entity, not delivering and wholly inaccurate, despite all the challenges,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gardner said, citing joint European-American efforts in counterterrorism, trade, sanctions, security, digital privacy and policing. \xe2\x80\x9cEven Mrs. May has said Britain sees a cohesive E.U. in British interests. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see a disintegrating E.U. on its doorstep and nor do we. Hopefully that will be heard by others in the administration.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Tusk, he said, has a point, trying to dissuade other European Union nations, like Hungary and Poland, from rushing to Washington to try to make separate deals, which would be illegal, with the Trump administration. China and Russia, too, have always tried to ignore the European Union and deal bilaterally with member states, something Mr. Trump seems to be encouraging.'b'The French, who are being tough on a British withdrawal and are deeply disconcerted by Mr. Trump, see him as a bigger threat to European cohesion, said Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform. \xe2\x80\x9cThey see the three great world powers \xe2\x80\x94 Russia, China and now the U.S. \xe2\x80\x94 wanting to destroy the E.U.,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'One impact of Mr. Trump that Mr. Tusk is clearly hoping for, Mr. Grant said, is \xe2\x80\x9cto reinforce a feeling of solidarity among mainstream European politicians.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Another result, said Fran\xc3\xa7ois Heisbourg, a senior adviser with the French Foundation for Strategic Research, may be a more serious European effort at forming its own defense capacity, which may not be in the interests of NATO or the United States.'b'The American commitment to NATO and the European Union has been unconditional since their creation, Mr. Heisbourg said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut Trump sees alliances as transactional, and once you state that, countries like Poland, Hungary and Japan start to hedge their bets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Mr. Heisbourg also notes the impact of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s dark view of the world as a helpless America being taken to the cleaners by its allies. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the Trump world there are no sunny uplands, just darkness and hatred,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd in a continent that has had its share of hatred, this resonates.\xe2\x80\x9d'
