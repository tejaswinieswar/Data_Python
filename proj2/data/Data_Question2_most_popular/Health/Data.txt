b'Popcorn munching. Soup slurping. Nose sniffling. Or, simply, breathing.'b'Ever wonder why some ordinary sounds 'b'drive you crazy'b'? It\xe2\x80\x99s called misophonia, a mysterious affliction in which seemingly harmless sounds unleash anger, anxiety and, in some cases, 'b'panic attacks'b' in some people.'b''b'I'b''b'f you\xe2\x80\x99re one'b' of them,'b' neuroscientists at Newcastle University'b' in Britain say they may have found an explanation for what ails you.'b'In a report on the latest study published Thursday in the journal 'b'Current Biology'b', the neuroscientists say that brain scans of misophonia sufferers show that particular sounds, like eating and drinking, cause the part of their brain that processes emotions, the anterior insular cortex, to go into overdrive.'b'That region in sufferers was also connected differently, compared to normal brains, to the amygdala and the hippocampus, areas that are involved in recalling past experiences, said Dr. Sukhbinder Kumar, the lead researcher from the Institute of Neuroscience at Newcastle University.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe think that misophonia may be heavily connected to recalling past memories, because people with misophonia have had very bad experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in a phone interview Friday.'b'The research opens up the possibilities of future therapy for those afflicted with misophonia, a 'b'term coined by the American scientists 'b'Pawel and Margaret Jastreboff in 2001.'b'A survey of nearly 200 misophonia sufferers showed that the average age at which they first became aware of the condition was 12, Dr. Kumar said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen they hear these sounds, it\xe2\x80\x99s like their attention is completely absorbed by the sounds, and they can\xe2\x80\x99t do anything else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re triggering a recall.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For the study, the team used an 'b'M.R.I.'b' to measure the brain activities of 42 people with and without misophonia while they were listening to a range of noises.'b'The sounds were categorized into neutral ones like rain; unpleasant sounds like a crying baby; and trigger sounds that were mostly linked to eating, chewing, drinking and breathing.'b'When exposed to the noises, those with misophonia showed brain activities different from those without the condition.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe most dominant reaction is anger and anxiety, not disgust,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Kumar said.'b'But why those sounds, and not others, trigger such averse reactions remains a mystery, he said. The exact number of misophonia sufferers in the world is unknown, he said, because it was only recently diagnosed as a condition.'b'The affliction can be so acute in some people that they can\xe2\x80\x99t stand living with their own families. Olana Tansley-Hancock, 29, of Kent, England, was just 8 when family meals became a real chore.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe noise of my family eating forced me to retreat to my own bedroom for meals,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the team at Newcastle University. \xe2\x80\x9cI can only describe it as a feeling of wanting to punch people in the face when I heard the noise of them eating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Kumar said in a 'b'news release,'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy hope is to identify the brain signature of the trigger sounds \xe2\x80\x94 those signatures can be used for treatment such as for neuro-feedback for example, where people can self-regulate their reactions by looking at what kind of brain activity is being produced.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the study\xe2\x80\x99s findings will come as some relief to misophonia sufferers and reassure some who question the condition\xe2\x80\x99s validity, he added.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis study demonstrates the critical brain changes as further evidence to convince a skeptical medical community that this is a genuine disorder.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. James Weinstein, a back pain specialist and chief executive of Dartmouth-Hitchcock Health System, has some advice for most people with 'b'lower back pain'b': Take two aspirin and don\xe2\x80\x99t call me in the morning.'b'On Monday, the 'b'American College of Physicians'b' published updated 'b'guidelines'b' that say much the same. In making the new recommendations for the treatment of most people with lower back pain, the group is bucking what many doctors do and changing its previous guidelines, which called for medication as first-line therapy.'b'Dr. Nitin Damle, president of the group\xe2\x80\x99s board of regents and a practicing internist, said pills, even over-the-counter pain relievers and anti-inflammatories, should not be the first choice. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to look at therapies that are nonpharmacological first,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is a change.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The recommendations come as the United States is struggling with an epidemic of opioid addiction that often begins with a simple prescription for ailments like back pain. In recent years, a number of states have enacted measures aimed at curbing prescription painkillers. The problem has also led many doctors around the country to reassess prescribing practices.'b'The group did not address surgery. Its focus was on noninvasive treatment.'b'The new guidelines said that doctors should avoid prescribing opioid painkillers for relief of back pain and suggested that before patients try anti-inflammatories or muscle relaxants, they should try alternative therapies like exercise, 'b'acupuncture'b', massage therapy or yoga. Doctors should reassure their patients that they will get better no matter what treatment they try, the group said. The guidelines also said that 'b'steroid'b' injections were not helpful, and neither was acetaminophen, like Tylenol, although other over-the-counter pain relievers like aspirin, naproxen or ibuprofen could provide some relief.'b'Dr. Weinstein, who was not an author of the guidelines, said patients have to stay active and wait it out. \xe2\x80\x9cBack pain has a natural course that does not require intervention,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'In fact, for most of the people with acute back pain \xe2\x80\x94 defined as present for four weeks or less that does not radiate down the leg \xe2\x80\x94 there is no need to see a doctor at all, said Dr. Rick Deyo, a spine researcher and professor at the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, Ore., and an author of the new guidelines.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor acute back pain, the analogy is to the 'b'common cold'b',\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Deyo said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very common and very annoying when it happens. But most of the time it will not result in anything major or serious. \xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even those with chronic back pain \xe2\x80\x94 lasting at least 12 weeks \xe2\x80\x94 should start with nonpharmacological treatments, the guidelines say. If patients still want medication, they can try over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen or aspirin.'b'Scans, like an 'b'M.R.I.'b', for diagnosis are worse than useless for back pain patients, members of the group said in telephone interviews. The results can be misleading, showing what look like abnormalities that actually are not related to the pain.'b'Measures that help patients get back to their usual routines can help along the way, as Sommer Kleweno Walley, 43, of Seattle, can attest. Last spring, she slipped on the stairs in her house and fell down hard, on her back.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a couple of hours I could barely walk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was in real pain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She saw a physical therapist, but the pain persisted. Eleven days later, she showed up at the office of Dr. Christopher J. Standaert, a spine specialist at the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. She expected to receive an M.R.I., at least, and maybe a drug for pain.'b'But Dr. Standaert told her an M.R.I. would not make any difference in her diagnosis or recovery and that the main thing was to keep active. She ended up getting anti-inflammatory medication and doing 'b'physical therapy'b'. A few months later, her back stopped hurting.'b'It is surprising, some experts in back pain say, how often patients are helped by treatments that are not medical, even by a placebo that patients are told at the start is really a placebo.'b'Dr. Standaert cited a 'b'study'b' in which patients with chronic low back pain were offered a placebo, and were told it was a placebo, along with their usual treatment \xe2\x80\x94 often an anti-inflammatory drug like ibuprofen or naproxen. Or, the patients remained with their usual treatment alone.'b'Those taking the placebo reported less pain and disability than those in the control group who did not take it. The placebo effect, although modest, was about the same as the effect in studies testing nonpharmacological treatments for back pain like acupuncture, massage or chiropractic manipulations.'b'Many people with chronic back pain tend to shut down, avoiding their usual activities, afraid of making things worse, Dr. Standaert said. Helping them is not a matter of prescribing drugs but rather teaching them to set goals and work toward returning to an active life, even if they still have pain.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have to believe their life can get better,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Standaert said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have to believe they can get to a better state.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The question is: Will the new guidelines be adopted?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPatients are looking for a cure,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Steven J. Atlas, a back pain specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an 'b'editorial'b' accompanying the article on the new recommendations. \xe2\x80\x9cThe guidelines are for managing pain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Added to the problem are the incentives that push doctors and patients toward medications, scans and injections, Dr. Deyo said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is marketing from professional organizations and from industry,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98We have the cure. You can expect to be cured. You can expect to be pain free.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Medical insurance also contributes to the treatment problem, back experts say, because it does not pay for remedies like mindfulness training or chiropractic manipulations which, Dr. Deyo added, \xe2\x80\x9care not cheap.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even if doctors want to recommend such treatments, there is no easy referral system, Dr. Atlas said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is much easier at Mass General to get a shot than to get a mind-body or cognitive behavioral therapy,\xe2\x80\x9d he added.'b'Dr. Weinstein has a prescription: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat we need to do is to stop medicalizing symptoms,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Pills are not going to make people better and as for other treatments, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyoga and tai chi, all those things are wonderful, but why not just go back to your normal activities?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know your back hurts, but go run, be active, instead of taking a pill.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s vow to overhaul the 'b'Food and Drug Administration'b' could bring major changes in policy, including steps to accelerate the process of approving new prescription drugs, setting up a clash with critics who say his push for deregulation might put consumers at risk.'b'Mr. Trump has been vetting candidates to run the agency, which regulates the safety of everything from drugs and medical devices to food and cosmetics. Among them is Jim O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, a former official at the Health and Human Services Department 'b'who is an associate'b' of the Silicon Valley billionaire and 'b'Trump supporter Peter Thiel. 'b'Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill has argued that companies should not have to prove that their drugs work in clinical trials before selling them to consumers.'b'Other candidates also have called for reducing regulatory hurdles.'b'If the most significant proposals are adopted \xe2\x80\x94 and many would require an act of Congress \xe2\x80\x94 they will reverse decades of policy and consumer protections dating to the 1960s. Congress toughened the drug approval process in the wake of the worldwide crisis over thalidomide, which caused severe 'b'birth defects'b' in babies whose mothers had taken the drug in 'b'pregnancy'b'. Since then, the F.D.A. has come to be viewed as the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading watchdog for protecting the safety of food and drugs, a gold standard whose lead other countries often follow.'b'Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s most recent statements, made at a White House round-table discussion last week with leaders of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top drug companies, have reverberated throughout the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Supporters of deregulation have long wanted to reduce bureaucracy and lessen oversight of drugs and devices, while critics say the market for drugs could be destabilized and the door opened to unproven products based on junk science.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone depends on the agency, from the drugs in our medicine cabinet to the food on our dinner table, to our blood supplies,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Dr. David Kessler'b', who was commissioner of the F.D.A. during the presidencies of the elder George Bush and Bill Clinton. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are the envy of the world because our honey is our honey. Our foods are not laced with 'b'pesticides'b'. Our drugs work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Trump said at the meeting that he was close to naming a \xe2\x80\x9cfantastic\xe2\x80\x9d person to lead the agency. In addition to Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill, candidates whose names have recently surfaced include 'b'Dr. Scott Gottlieb'b', a former F.D.A. official with longstanding ties to pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and 'b'Dr. Joseph Gulfo'b', a former biotech and medical device executive.'b'All three have called for streamlining the drug approval process, but Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill\xe2\x80\x99s stance has drawn the most attention. He is a managing director of Mithril Capital Management, an investment firm Mr. Thiel co-founded, and previously led the Thiel Foundation, Mr. Thiel\xe2\x80\x99s philanthropic organization. During the George W. Bush administration, Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill held a series of roles in the Health and Human Services Department, including as principal associate deputy secretary, where he worked on policy, including for the F.D.A., according to his 'b'LinkedIn profile'b'.'b'Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill is a libertarian who is on the board of 'b'the SENS Research Foundation'b', a charity that funds anti-aging research, and until recently served on the board of the Seasteading Institute, an effort to create new societies at sea.'b'At an anti-aging conference in 2014, 'b'Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill advocated'b' something he called \xe2\x80\x9cprogressive\xe2\x80\x9d approval, in which drugs that were proved safe, but not yet proven effective, could be allowed on the market. \xe2\x80\x9cLet people start using them, at their own risk,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill said. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s prove efficacy after they\xe2\x80\x99ve been legalized.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Companies have been required to prove that their drugs work since 'b' 1962'b', when Congress passed legislation requiring that licensing for sale be based not just on safety but also on \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial evidence\xe2\x80\x9d of a drug\xe2\x80\x99s efficacy. That law, and others passed since, forced companies to rigorously test their products, running them through a gantlet of clinical trials whose results are then vetted by the F.D.A. before any sales to consumers. Ninety percent of drugs that enter clinical development fail these trials. (The F.D.A. also regulates medical devices, but they undergo a separate approval process.)'b'As a result, newly discovered drugs can take years to reach the market, a period that Mr. Trump said last week was too lengthy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you have a drug, you can actually get it approved if it works, instead of waiting for many, many years,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the pharmaceutical executives. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be cutting regulations at a level that nobody\xe2\x80\x99s ever seen before, and we\xe2\x80\x99re going to have tremendous protection for the people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some have suggested that a commissioner determined to weaken the efficacy standard need not seek congressional action, but could interpret existing regulations loosely so that requirements for certain clinical trials \xe2\x80\x94 particularly the costly, large-scale ones that can take years and involve thousands of patients \xe2\x80\x94 can be rolled back.'b'That could have serious implications for patients. Last month, 'b'the F.D.A. released'b' a study of 22 drugs that appeared promising in early studies but failed in final, large-scale trials. Drug safety watchdogs point to examples like the painkiller 'b'Vioxx'b', which was withdrawn from the market in 2004 over safety concerns, as proof of the high stakes involved in drug approval.'b'While Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s call to cut regulations has been warmly received by other industries, some biotech executives 'b'have reacted to his remarks with alarm'b'. Those affiliated with some smaller companies have privately described the choice of Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill as a worst-case scenario that could send the drug industry into chaos. The F.D.A., they say, is not perfect, but its standards provide a level playing field on which both big and small companies can compete.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not selling Coca-Cola and Pepsi, where patients can taste the Coca-Cola and decide if they like it,\xe2\x80\x9d said John M. Maraganore, the chief executive of'b' Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, a Massachusetts biotech firm.'b' \xe2\x80\x9cOur products are lifesaving medicines.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Industry executives said big changes to the agency would also be bad for business, making it difficult for companies with breakthrough treatments to distinguish their products from those that are shams. If standards at the F.D.A. are rolled back, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we might as well be advertising in the middle of the night on how terrifically we can cure all your illnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of 'b'Regeneron, a pharmaceutical company in Tarrytown, N.Y.'b' \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not the business that I think most of us want to be in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Daniel Carpenter, a professor at Harvard University who studies the F.D.A., said its role is not just to ensure the safety of a drug. \xe2\x80\x9cThe underpinnings of belief among patients, payers, even investors, is that somebody out there has tested these things and has shown, with some evidence, that they work,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. O\xe2\x80\x99Neill did not respond to emails and a phone call requesting comment, and Dr. Gottlieb declined to comment.'b'Dr. Gulfo, the former biotech executive, said he had spoken with several people on the president\xe2\x80\x99s transition team about the F.D.A. job. He said he was in favor of keeping the efficacy requirement. But he said he believed the agency\xe2\x80\x99s standards were too rigid and burdensome to companies with innovative ideas. He called on the agency to approve more drugs based on what are known as \xe2\x80\x9csurrogate endpoints\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 showing that a 'b'diabetes'b' drug lowers blood sugar, for example \xe2\x80\x94 rather than forcing companies to prove that the product improves long-term outcomes like survival rates or lowering the chance for heart attacks.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s bring the F.D.A. back to what its mission is, and its mission is to make sure that drugs can be labeled for safe use, and that they\xe2\x80\x99re not snake oil,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Gulfo, the former chief executive of MELA Sciences, who wrote a book about his company\xe2\x80\x99s failed efforts to get its 'b'skin cancer detection'b' device approved. (The agency eventually approved it for use in 2011.)'b'Several drug company executives said the F.D.A., while not perfect, had sped up the approval process in recent years and had been responsive to requests to approve drugs based on interim measurements, particularly for life-threatening diseases that have no other treatments. The agency 'b'sets a 10-month goal'b' for approving standard drugs, and a six-month period for those that have qualified for expedited approval; 'b'one recent study'b' showed it decides on drugs more quickly than its counterparts in Europe and Canada.'b'A majority of recent new drugs were approved through expedited approvals,'b' another recent study found'b'. In December, 'b'Congress passed a law'b' that further speeds approvals for certain drugs and medical devices.'b''b'Drug industry leaders say'b' that they want the F.D.A. to be more open to allowing new kinds of clinical trials, and that it needs to become more nimble in keeping up with the breathtaking pace of medical advances. They have also been prodding the agency to fill an estimated 1,000 staff vacancies so that decisions can be made more quickly. But that is apparently delayed because the president ordered an across-the-board hiring freeze.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe only way you would make it shorter is you staff up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Gilman, an entrepreneur who has founded several biotech companies. \xe2\x80\x9cYou certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t do it by slashing staff. So the logic of the whole thing doesn\xe2\x80\x99t compute for me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'SUNDARBANS NATIONAL PARK, Bangladesh'b''b''b'Two hundred years ago'b', the first 'b'cholera'b' pandemic emerged from these tiger-infested mangrove swamps.'b'It began in 1817, after the British East India Company sent thousands of workers deep into the remote Sundarbans, part of the Ganges River Delta, to log the jungles and plant rice. These brackish waters are the cradle of Vibrio cholerae, a bacterium that clings to human intestines and emits a toxin so virulent that the body will pour all of its fluids into the gut to flush it out.'b'Water loss turns victims ashen; their eyes sink into their sockets, and their blood turns black and congeals in their capillaries. Robbed of electrolytes, their hearts lose their beat. Victims die of shock and organ failure, sometimes in as little as six hours after the first abdominal rumblings.'b'Cholera probably had festered here for eons. Since that first escape, it has circled the world in seven pandemic cycles that have killed tens of millions.'b'Artists of the 19th century often depicted it as a skeleton with a scythe and victims heaped at its feet. It stalked revelers at a masked ball in Heinrich Heine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Cholera in Paris'b'\xe2\x80\x9d and kills the protagonist in Thomas Mann\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Death in Venice'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Outbreaks forced London, New York and other cities to create vast public water systems, transforming civic life.'b'Today cholera garners panicky headlines when it strikes unexpectedly in places like Ethiopia or Haiti. But it is a continuing threat in 'b'nearly 70 countries'b', where more than one billion people are at risk.'b'Now, thanks largely to efforts that began in cholera\xe2\x80\x99s birthplace, a way to finally conquer the long-dreaded plague is in sight.'b'A treatment protocol so effective that it saves 99.9 percent of all victims was pioneered here. The World Health Organization estimates that it has saved about 50 million lives in the past four decades.'b'Just as important, after 35 years of work, researchers in Bangladesh and elsewhere have developed an effective cholera vaccine. It has been accepted by the W.H.O. and stockpiled for epidemics like the one 'b'that struck Haiti'b' in 2010. Soon, there may be enough to begin routine vaccination in countries where the disease has a permanent foothold.'b'Merely creating that stockpile \xe2\x80\x94 even of a few million doses \xe2\x80\x94 'b'profoundly improved the way the world fought cholera'b', Dr. Margaret Chan, secretary general of the W.H.O., said last year. Ready access to the vaccine has made countries less tempted to cover up outbreaks to protect tourism, she said.'b'That has sped up emergency responses and attracted more vaccine makers, lowering costs. \xe2\x80\x9cMore cholera vaccines have been deployed over the last two years than in the previous 15 years combined,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Chan said.'b'The treatment advances relied heavily on research and testing done at the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, known as the ICDDR,B, in Dhaka.'b'Although Dhaka may not be the first place one might look to find a public health revolution, the center is famous among experts in gut diseases.'b'While its upper levels are quiet and scholarly, the center\xe2\x80\x99s ground floor is the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest 'b'diarrhea'b' hospital. Its vast wards treat 220,000 patients a year, almost all of whom recover within 36 hours. Doctors there save hundreds of lives a day.'b'The ICDDR,B was originally the Cholera Research Laboratory, founded in 1960 by the United States as part of that era\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csoft diplomacy.\xe2\x80\x9d Research hospitals were built in friendly countries both to save lives locally and to act as sentinels for diseases that might threaten America.'b'The wards, which in the rainy season extend into circus-size tents in the parking lot, contain long rows of \xe2\x80\x9ccholera cots.\xe2\x80\x9d On each iron or wood frame is a plastic sheet with a hole in the middle. A bucket beneath the hole catches diarrhea, while another beside the cot fills with vomit. An IV pole completes the setup.'b'Defying expectations, the ward smells only of the antiseptic that the floors are constantly mopped with.'b'Patients with severe watery diarrhea arrive around the clock, many of them carried in \xe2\x80\x94 limp, dehydrated and barely conscious \xe2\x80\x94 by friends or family. A nurse sees each one immediately, and those close to death get an IV line inserted within 30 seconds.'b'It contains a blend of glucose, electrolytes and water. Cholera spurs the intestines to violently flush themselves, but it does not actually damage the gut cells. If the fluid is replaced and the bacteria flushed out or killed by 'b'antibiotics'b', the patient is usually fine.'b'Within hours, patients start to revive. As soon as they can swallow, they get an antibiotic and start drinking a rehydration solution. Most walk out within a day. The techniques perfected here are so effective that the ICDDR,B has sent training teams to 17 cholera outbreaks in the past decade.'b'Usually, the only patients who stay long in the hospital are infants so malnourished that another bout of diarrhea would kill them. They live for up to a month in a separate ward with their mothers, who are taught how to cook nutritious porridges from the cheapest lentils, squash, onions, greens and oil.'b'Only about 20 percent of the patients at the center have cholera. The rest usually have rotavirus, 'b'salmonella'b' or E. coli. The same therapy saves them all, but the cholera cases are more urgent because these patients plummet so precipitously toward death.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought I was dying,\xe2\x80\x9d Mohammed Mubarak, a gaunt 26-year-old printing press worker, said one afternoon from his cot. His roommates had carried him in at 7 that morning, unconscious and with no detectable pulse.'b'Now, after six liters of intravenous solution, he was still weak but able to sit up and drink the rehydration solution and eat bits of bread and banana.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHis stool is changing from rice-water to green, so he is recovering,\xe2\x80\x9d said Momtaz Begum, the ward nurse who monitors the buckets and makes sure patients take in as much liquid as they lose.'b'Mr. Mubarak had first fallen ill at about 2 a.m., a few hours after he drank tap water with his dinner. \xe2\x80\x9cUsually I drink safe water, filtered water,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I drank the city water last night. I think that is what did this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cholera, born in the swamps, arrived long ago in Dhaka. The city is home to more that 15 million, and a third of the population lives in slums. In some places, water pipes made of rubbery plastic are pierced by illegal connections that suck in sewage from the gutters they traverse and carry pathogens down the line to new victims, like Mr. Mubarak.'b'Vibrio cholerae travels from person to person via fecal matter. In 1854, the epidemiologist John Snow famously traced cases to a single well dug near a cesspit in which a mother had washed the diaper of a baby who died of cholera and nd convinced officials to remove the well\xe2\x80\x99s pump handle.'b'Because cholera is a constant threat to hundreds of millions of people lacking safe drinking water in China, India, Nigeria and many other countries, scientists have long sought a more powerful weapon: a cheap, effective vaccine.'b'Now they have one.'b'Injected cholera vaccines were first invented in the 1800s and were long required for entry into some countries. But many scientists suspected they did not work, and in the 1970s studies overseen by the ICDDR,B confirmed that.'b'In the 1980s, a Swedish scientist, Dr. Jan Holmgren, invented an oral vaccine that worked an impressive 85 percent of the time. But it was expensive to make and had to be drunk with a large glass of buffer solution to protect it from stomach acid.'b'Transporting tanks of buffer was impractical. Making matters worse, it was fizzy, and poor Bangladeshi children who had never tasted soft drinks would spit it out as soon as it tickled their noses.'b'In 1986, a Vietnamese scientist, Dr. Dang Duc Trach, asked for the formula, believing he could make a bufferless version. Dr. Holmgren and Dr. John D. Clemens, an American vaccine expert who at the time was a research scientist for the ICDDR,B, obliged.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis isn\xe2\x80\x99t an elegant vaccine \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s just a bunch of killed cells, technology that\xe2\x80\x99s been around since Louis Pasteur,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Clemens, who is now the ICDDR,B\xe2\x80\x99s executive director.'b'He and Dr. Holmgren lost touch with Dr. Dang, largely because of Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s isolation in those days. But seven years later, Dr. Dang notified them that he had made a new version of the vaccine. He had tested it on 70,000 residents of Hue, in central Vietnam, and had found it to be 60 percent effective.'b'Although his was not as effective as Dr. Holmgren\xe2\x80\x99s, it cost only 25 cents a dose. If enough people in an area can be made immune through vaccination, outbreaks often stop spontaneously.'b'In 1997, Vietnam became the first \xe2\x80\x94 and thus far, only \xe2\x80\x94 country to provide cholera vaccine to its citizens routinely, not just in emergencies. Cases dropped sharply, according to 'b'a 2014 study'b', and in 2003 cholera vanished from Hue, where the campaign focused most heavily.'b'But Dr. Dang had not conducted a classic clinical trial, and Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine factory did not meet W.H.O. standards, so no United Nations agency was allowed to buy his vaccine.'b'Because no pharmaceutical company had an incentive to pay for trials or factories, his invention languished in \xe2\x80\x9cthe valley of death\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the expensive gap between a product that works in a lab and a factory-made version safe for millions.'b'In 1999, Dr. Clemens approached what is now the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, which was just getting organized.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey were literally operating out of a basement then,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got a letter from Bill Gates Sr. It was very relaxed, sort of, \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s $40 million. Would you mind sending me a report once in a while?\xe2\x80\x99'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut without that,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Clemens continued, \xe2\x80\x9cthis wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have seen the light of day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With that money, Dr. Clemens reformulated Dr. Dang\xe2\x80\x99s vaccine, conducted a successful clinical trial in Calcutta and found an Indian company, Shantha Biotechnics, that could make it to W.H.O. standards.'b'Rolled out in 2009 under the name Shanchol, it came in a vial about the size of a chess rook, needed no buffer and cost less than $2 a dose. Even so, there was little interest, even from the W.H.O.'b'The vaccine lacked the publicity campaign that pharmaceutical companies throw behind commercial products, and \xe2\x80\x9ccholera ward care\xe2\x80\x9d was saving many lives \xe2\x80\x94 when it could be organized. The new vaccine was not used in a cholera outbreak in Zimbabwe in 2009, or initially in Haiti\xe2\x80\x99s explosive outbreak in 2010.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cvalley of death\xe2\x80\x9d lengthened: Without customers, Shantha could not afford to build a bigger factory. The 'b'impasse was broken'b' only when Dr. Paul Farmer, a founder of Partners in Health, which has worked in central Haiti since 1987, began publicly 'b'berating the W.H.O.'b' for 'b'not moving faster.'b''b'The agency approved Shanchol in 2011, and since then, the vaccine has slowly gained acceptance. In 2013, 'b'an emergency stockpile'b' was started, and the GAVI Alliance committed $115 million to raise it to six million doses.'b'The vaccine is 'b'now used in Haiti'b', and has been deployed in outbreaks in Iraq, South Sudan and elsewhere. A second version, Euvichol, from South Korea, was approved in 2015.'b'And later this year, Bangladesh \xe2\x80\x94 where it all began \xe2\x80\x94 hopes to begin wiping out its persistent cholera. A local company has begun making a domestic version of the vaccine, called Vaxchol. Dr. Firdausi Qadri, a leading ICDDR,B researcher, estimated last year that success there would require almost 200 million doses.'b'The world finally has a vaccine that, with routine administration, could end one of history\xe2\x80\x99s great scourges. But what will happen is still hazy.'b'With 1.4 billion people at risk, the potential cost of vaccination in cholera-endemic countries is enormous. And the disease tends to move, surging and vanishing among the many causes of diarrhea.'b'Even Bill Gates, who paid for much of the research, 'b'has asked'b': \xe2\x80\x9cWe actually have a cholera vaccine, but where should it be used?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Looking back on his long struggle to prove the vaccine\xe2\x80\x99s value, and then to win acceptance, Dr. Clemens offered an explanation that blended wistfulness and cynicism. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re probably not bad scientists,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we were lousy advocates.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf this disease had been in American kids, there would have been trials as fast as the Salk 'b'polio vaccine'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'WASHINGTON \xe2\x80\x94 A flurry of actions by President Trump and Congress against the Affordable Care Act injected confusion and uncertainty into the final weeks of the annual period to sign up for coverage, and many, but not all, enrollment groups were reporting a drop in people seeking insurance as the deadline loomed on Tuesday.'b'The actions include the executive order that Mr. Trump signed hours after his 'b'inauguration'b', directing federal agencies to take all possible steps to minimize the \xe2\x80\x9cburdens\xe2\x80\x9d the law imposes, and House and Senate votes to begin the process of repealing the law. The Trump administration also scaled back advertisements that encourage people to sign up for 'b'health insurance'b' under the law, although after a public backlash late last week, the administration decided not to pull the ads altogether.'b'Interviews with about two dozen enrollment counselors and insurance agents around the country suggested that in some states, including Alaska, New York and Washington, a steady flow of people were signing up until the last minute. Yet in many other places, counselors who help people sign up for insurance under the seven-year-old law said that enrollment had flattened in recent weeks and that the burst of activity they had come to expect at the end of open enrollment had never happened this year. All said their customers were worried about the future of their coverage and, in many cases, conflicted about whether to buy it for fear that they would soon lose it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome people ask, \xe2\x80\x98What\xe2\x80\x99s the point if the law is going to be repealed?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Emily Black Bremer, an insurance agent in Clayton, Mo., outside St. Louis. \xe2\x80\x9cShould they rush to get in before the A.C.A. is cut off? Should they give up because it\xe2\x80\x99s all going away? It\xe2\x80\x99s a tricky situation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The number of people who signed up for or renewed coverage during this fourth enrollment period will be an important sign of whether the individual insurance market will remain stable over the coming months as Republicans work to repeal the law and try to come to a consensus on what to replace it with. A larger pool of enrollees is more likely to include healthier people whose premiums can help pay for the care provided to those who are sick.'b'Over the last few weeks, Mr. Trump has promised to replace the law with better, cheaper coverage \xe2\x80\x9cfor everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d while Republicans in Congress have struggled to come up with a plan that could come close to meeting the president\xe2\x80\x99s goals and have expressed growing alarm at Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s demand for speed. Public polls have also shown growing support for the existing law.'b'As of Jan. 14, the last time that the Obama administration released data, about 8.8 million people had signed up for coverage through 'b'HealthCare.gov'b', the federal insurance marketplace serving 39 states. (The other states run their own marketplaces.) That is about 100,000 more people than were enrolled at the same point last year.'b'The sign-up period started on Nov. 1, just before the election, and many enrollment counselors said they saw many people seeking coverage through Dec. 15, the deadline to buy it for January. In fact, the Obama administration said in December that more people \xe2\x80\x94 670,000 \xe2\x80\x94 enrolled on Dec. 15 than on any other day since the marketplaces opened for business in 2013.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe had a spike of interest that lasted through December,\xe2\x80\x9d said Karen Egozi, the chief executive of the 'b'Epilepsy'b' Foundation of Florida, one of several dozen nonprofit groups that won federal grants to help people sign up for insurance through the federal marketplace. \xe2\x80\x9cBut January came, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve had a huge drop. We are seeing a major slowdown.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Egozi said her group had completed 64 percent fewer enrollments from Jan. 1 to Jan. 29 than over the period last year. According to federal enrollment data, more than 1.6 million people in Florida had enrolled in private health plans through HealthCare.gov from Nov. 1 to Jan. 14.'b'Allen Gjersvig, the director of navigator and enrollment services at the Arizona Alliance for Community Health Centers, said a number of appointments with enrollment counselors had been canceled after Mr. Trump signed the executive order regarding the health law. A few people, he said, told counselors that they thought the law\xe2\x80\x99s tax penalty for going without insurance would no longer be enforced.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we called the folks and said nothing has changed yet,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Gjersvig said, \xe2\x80\x9csome decided to come in after all. But others said, \xe2\x80\x98Nope, it\xe2\x80\x99s just a matter of time before this law goes away.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The slowdown was not universal. In Alaska, Jessie Menkens, who oversees a widespread enrollment effort through her job at the Alaska Primary Care Association, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe were bracing for diminished participation, but it\xe2\x80\x99s been the opposite.\xe2\x80\x9d In New York, Donna Frescatore, the executive director of the state\xe2\x80\x99s insurance marketplace, said it had seen \xe2\x80\x9cunprecedented volume,\xe2\x80\x9d including a surge of enrollments over the last few weeks.'b'And in Texas, enrollment counselors at the Community Council of Greater Dallas have met with 60 percent more people than last year, said Sonia White, the group\xe2\x80\x99s director of coalitions and planning.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been by far our busiest open enrollment period,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. White, adding that the group had met with 1,200 people since the inauguration and 110 on Monday alone. On the other hand, she added, two groups that contract with hers to enroll people in rural Texas counties have reported a drop-off in interest this month.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are both in pretty significantly conservative areas,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. White said.'b'Confusion, though, has prevailed, with Mr. Trump often repeating his pledge to repeal the law and a handful of Republicans proposing complicated replacement plans, none of which would most likely cover as many people.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople are asking, \xe2\x80\x98Is my coverage only good for this month?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Shelli Quenga, whose nonprofit group, Palmetto Project, has a federal grant to help with enrollment in South Carolina.'b'Antoinette Kraus, director of the Pennsylvania Health Access Network, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the headline is \xe2\x80\x98Repeal Moving Forward,\xe2\x80\x99 people just panic and assume, \xe2\x80\x98Oh my God, I just lost my health coverage.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Kevin J. Counihan, the former chief executive of the federal marketplace, said that its call center had received tens of thousands of calls from worried consumers in the weeks before Mr. Obama left office. Among the callers, he said, were people worried that they would not be able to receive treatment for pre-existing conditions and parents worried that their children would lose coverage.'b'Dee Porter, chief executive of the Oklahoma Primary Care Association, which won a federal grant to help with enrollment, said that some Oklahomans, including a woman facing a year and a half of expensive treatment for 'b'cancer'b', were \xe2\x80\x9cuncertain about starting medications or therapies that require more than a few months of treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As of late December, enrollments in Oklahoma were up 6 percent compared with last year, according to data from the Obama administration. But while enrollment counselors continued to see \xe2\x80\x9cstrong interest\xe2\x80\x9d over the final week of open enrollment, said Steve Goldman, the primary care association\xe2\x80\x99s lead navigator, many consumers held back.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cInsurance is supposed to bring folks certainty and peace of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut now insurance is a big question mark.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'An influential science advisory group formed by the 'b'National Academy of Sciences'b' and the National Academy of Medicine on Tuesday lent its support to a once-unthinkable proposition: the modification of human embryos to create genetic traits that can be passed down to future generations.'b'This type of human gene editing has long been seen as an ethical minefield. Researchers fear that the techniques used to prevent genetic diseases might also be used to enhance intelligence, for example, or to create people physically suited to particular tasks, like serving as soldiers.'b'The advisory group endorsed only alterations designed to prevent babies from acquiring genes known to cause \xe2\x80\x9cserious diseases and disability,\xe2\x80\x9d and only when there is no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable alternative.\xe2\x80\x9d The report provides an explicit rationale for genetic research that the federal government has avoided supporting until now, although the work is being pursued in countries like Sweden and China.'b'So-called germ line engineering might allow people to have biological children without fear that they have passed on the genes for diseases like Huntington\xe2\x80\x99s, Tay-Sachs and beta 'b'thalassemia'b', and without discarding embryos carrying the disease-causing mutations, as is often done now. Though such cases are likely to be rare, the report says they should be taken seriously.'b'The new report heralds a day scientists have long warned is coming. After decades of science-fiction movies, cocktail party chatter and college seminars in which people have idly debated the ethics of humanity intervening in its own evolution, advancing technology dictates that the public now make some hard choices.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is essential for public discussions to precede any decisions about whether or how to pursue clinical trials of such applications,\xe2\x80\x9d said R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a leader of the panel that wrote the report. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd we need to have them now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just over a year ago, an international group of scientists said it would be \xe2\x80\x9cirresponsible to proceed\xe2\x80\x9d with making 'b'heritable'b' changes to the human genome until risks could be better assessed and there was \xe2\x80\x9cbroad societal consensus about the appropriateness\xe2\x80\x9d of any proposed change.'b''b'No one is pretending that such a consensus now exists. But in the year that the committee was deliberating, Ms. Charo said, the techniques required to perform this sort of gene editing have passed crucial milestones.'b'The advent of a powerful gene-editing tool called Crispr-Cas9 allows researchers to snip, insert and delete genetic material with increasing precision. It has led to plans for experimental treatments of adult patients with 'b'cancer'b', 'b'blindness'b' and other conditions as early as this year.'b'But these types of genetic alterations are not inherited.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPreviously, it was easy for people to say, \xe2\x80\x98This isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to think about it much,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard Hynes, a cancer researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who helped lead the committee with Ms. Charo.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow we can see a path whereby we might be able to do it, so we have to think about how to make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s used only for the right things and not for the wrong things,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'A more pragmatic concern driving the committee was the likelihood that the new technology would be adopted in countries like China, where some pioneering research on editing human embryos \xe2\x80\x94 without the intent to gestate them \xe2\x80\x94 has already occurred.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we have an absolute prohibition in the United States with this technology advancing, it\xe2\x80\x99s not like it won\xe2\x80\x99t happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Charo said.'b'But opponents of human germ line editing say that is not a reason to take a big step toward what they fear will be an inevitable push to engineer traits like strength, beauty and intelligence, perhaps eventually creating a dystopian social divide between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis opens the door to advertisements from fertility clinics of giving your child the best start in life with a gene-editing packet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marcy Darnovsky, the executive director of the Center for Genetics and Society, a public interest group in Berkeley, Calif. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd whether these are real advantages or perceived advantages, they would accrue disproportionately to people who are already advantaged.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The new guidelines, Ms. Darnovsky noted, also set the United States apart from many European countries that have signed a treaty to refrain from human germ line editing.'b'In addition to social concerns, there are questions of safety and autonomy. While Crispr is generally precise, it can have \xe2\x80\x9coff-target\xe2\x80\x9d effects, cutting DNA at places where it is not meant to. What if a child produced through a gene-editing technique were hobbled in some unforeseen way?'b'The new report called for prohibiting any alterations resembling \xe2\x80\x9cenhancement\xe2\x80\x9d, including \xe2\x80\x9coff label\xe2\x80\x9d applications. Under the guidelines, a genetic technique aimed at strengthening the muscles of patients with 'b'Duchenne muscular dystrophy'b', for instance, could not be used to make healthy people stronger.'b'But it is not clear who would draw those lines.'b'George Church, a geneticist at Harvard University, saw no clear prohibitions against certain enhancements in the report. \xe2\x80\x9cIf these fixes for severe diseases are shown to be safe and effective, why would small or large enhancements accompanying the fixes be unacceptable?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'b'No one should expect to design a baby anytime soon. It will probably be years before gene-editing techniques tested in animals can be shown to work in humans. And for the moment, the Food and Drug Administration is prohibited from using federal money to support research that results in genetically modified offspring.'b'In the meantime, said Sharon Terry, the president of the Genetic Alliance, a patient advocacy group, patients who may participate in clinical trials must begin a conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hope is that there would be serious considerations about what we are balancing here,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'If all goes well, Aliayha Carrasco-Garcia will have an operation next month that will change her life. She will shed many of the 240 pounds that now burden her 5-foot-2 frame. Like many who have bariatric surgery, she has tried diets and exercise to no avail. Surgery is her last best hope.'b'But there is a difference between Aliayha and almost everyone else who has had this operation: She is only 15.'b'While the number of adolescents who are overweight or obese has leveled off in recent years, the number who are severely obese \xe2\x80\x94 heavy enough to qualify for bariatric surgery \xe2\x80\x94 'b'has nearly doubled'b' from 1999 to 2014, according to national data, going from 5.2 to 10.2 percent of all adolescents aged 12 to 19. As a result, more and more doctors and parents are facing a difficult question: Should very heavy teenagers have bariatric surgery, a radical operation that is the only treatment proved to produce lasting weight loss in severely obese people?'b'The very idea fills many parents and doctors with trepidation, and with good reason, said Aaron Kelly, a physiologist and specialist in pediatric 'b'obesity'b' at the University of Minnesota. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re at a point in this field where surgery is the only thing that works for these kids but we don\xe2\x80\x99t know the long term outcomes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The best data are from two recently published small studies that so far have outcomes for just five years. Scientists say there\xe2\x80\x99s an urgent need for more ambitious research.'b'The question for teens and their parents is: Which is worse \xe2\x80\x94 accepting uncertainty about the long term health risks from surgery or the likelihood of serious health risks from remaining obese?'b'An estimated three to four million adolescents are heavy enough to meet the criteria for bariatric surgery, Dr. Kelly said. But only 'b'about 'b''b'1,000'b' teenagers a year have the operation. Many medical centers will not perform it on teenagers and many pediatricians never mention it to their heavy patients.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt obviously is a controversial area,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Marc P. Michalsky, the surgical director at the Center for Healthy Weight &amp; Nutrition at Nationwide Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio..'b'Obesity carries serious health risks in teenagers \xe2\x80\x94 including 'b'type 2 diabetes'b', 'b'high blood pressure'b', 'b'sleep apnea'b', 'b'acid reflux'b', fatty liver and high 'b'cholesterol'b' levels \xe2\x80\x94 that tend to be eased by surgery. Added to that are social problems, including isolation and depression.'b'Yet insurers routinely turn down teenagers on the first request, doctors say, leaving surgeons to appeal, sometimes multiple times, before they can operate on an adolescent. Dr. Kirk W. Reichard, the clinical director of pediatric surgery at the Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children where Aliayha is planning to undergo her operation, said Delaware\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Medicaid'b' program had denied coverage for all patients under the age of 18 with one exception.'b'When it comes to adult bariatric surgery, doctors say, insurers usually do not put up a fight. But doctors and patients often discount the option.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe still struggle with acceptance in the adult population,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. John M. Morton, the chief of bariatric and minimally invasive surgery at Stanford. \xe2\x80\x9cAcceptance in the pediatric community is even worse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The two recently published studies on outcomes were encouraging, obesity experts say. 'b'One'b', involving 58 adolescents, was led by investigators at Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati. 'b'The other'b', led by researchers at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, involved 81 adolescents. Most of the participants in both studies lost at least a third of their weight and kept it off for at least five years. 'b'Diabetes'b' often went into remission. 'b'Blood pressure'b' readings that were high often fell to normal levels.'b'Despite their weight loss, 63 percent of the teenagers were still severely obese after the surgery \xe2\x80\x94 only one reached a normal weight \xe2\x80\x94 and nearly half had nutritional abnormalities, including 'b'iron deficiency anemia'b' and low levels of 'b'vitamin D'b' and vitamin B12. Nearly half had 'b'hyperparathyroidism'b', a serious condition that leads to the leaching of 'b'calcium'b' from bone.'b'Many more could have reached a normal weight, said Dr. Thomas Inge, the director of adolescent metabolic and bariatric surgery at Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, who led the Cincinnati study, if they had had the operation when they were younger, before they got so obese. The participants\xe2\x80\x99 average age was 17 and their average body mass index was 58.5. (That corresponds to person 5 feet 4 inches tall who weighs 341 pounds.)'b'Some researchers worry that five years may not be long enough to understand the effect of the surgery on people who undergo it as an adolescent.'b'The operations alter brain signals that control weight and appetite and change hundreds of nerve and hormonal signals to the brain. What, researchers ask, are the consequences for still-developing brains and bones and bodies? Could low levels of vitamin D cause 'b'osteoporosis'b'?'b'The procedure for teenagers is the same as for adults \xe2\x80\x94 either a sleeve 'b'gastrectomy'b', in which much of the stomach is cut away to form a small pouch, or a gastric bypass in which the stomach is made smaller and part of the small intestine is rerouted. The operations are just as safe in teenagers as in adults, surgeons say: Mortality rates are around 0.1 percent, which makes them safer than gallbladder surgery or joint replacement.'b'Both operations require patients to follow detailed medical instructions, including taking supplements for the rest of their lives after surgery. Adolescents, though, are not always the most compliant patients. Dr. Inge said that when he first started offering the surgery in 2004, several of his patients developed 'b'beriberi'b', a serious condition that can affect the heart and nervous system. It is caused by a lack of 'b'thiamine'b'.'b'The beriberi problem was solved, Dr. Inge said, after he began warning patients and insisting they take a thiamine tablet for six months after surgery. \xe2\x80\x9cWe never saw it again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'To qualify for bariatric surgery, teenage patients generally must have a body mass index of at least 40, with other medical problems like sleep apnea or diabetes, or a B.M.I. of at least 50 without related medical conditions. Bariatric surgery is the only effective weight loss option for most of these teenagers.'b'Diets, exercise and behavioral therapy almost never solve their weight problem, said Dr. Stephen R. Daniels, pediatrician in chief at Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Colorado. Moreover, an obese adolescent is almost certain to become an obese adult. The grim prognosis, \xe2\x80\x9cdebunks the wishful thinking that they will outgrow it,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Michalsky said.'b'Of course the best option would be to prevent kids from becoming obese in the first place, but that is not so easy. There seems to be a strong genetic component that is not easily overridden. Most of the teenagers who have the surgery have a parent who also is extremely obese, said Margaret H. Zeller, a professor of pediatrics and psychologist at Cincinnati Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital whose research focuses on adolescents with severe obesity. Dr. Morton has operated on patients from three generations in some families.'b'But despite their qualms about possible medical problems with bones or other body systems in the future, many researchers and surgeons say those concerns are dwarfed by the consequences of being an obese teenager.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am less concerned about osteoporosis than that their lives will be completely destroyed if they don\xe2\x80\x99t get some serious weight off,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Lee M. Kaplan, the director of the weight center at Massachusetts General Hospital. By completely destroyed, he adds, he means \xe2\x80\x9cmedically, socially and economically.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve had many patients tell me they\xe2\x80\x99d rather be dead,\xe2\x80\x9d than remain fat, Dr. Morton said.'b'In almost every aspect, life for very obese teenagers is \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly impaired,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Zeller said. These difficulties, Dr. Zeller noted, are piled onto the normal angst of 'b'adolescence'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not just that people make them feel uncomfortable,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The physical effort of carrying the weight around can make simple tasks arduous, like walking from one area of a high school to another or sitting at desks too small for them. Many have sleep apnea, making it difficult to stay awake in class. And, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cinside, they are feeling ashamed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although not every obese teenager feels isolated and friendless, many, including Aliayha, do. She asked to be home-schooled, but her mother, Cristina Carrasco, refused.'b'Aliayha was not alone in wanting to leave school. Overwhelmed by their struggles, as many as 10 percent of obese students in grades eight to 12 leave the classroom and are home-schooled or take online classes instead, Dr. Zeller and her colleagues have found. That is nearly three times the rate of 'b'home schooling'b' in the general population in those grades, according to the Department of Education.'b'But some teenagers expect too much from the surgery. They are told they will lose a significant amount of weight, feel better and be healthier but that they are unlikely to reach a normal weight. They are told the surgery will not solve all their problems. Some, though, hold out unrealistic expectations.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey see shows about bariatric surgery or YouTube. They have this idea about the before and afters,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Zeller said. But, she added, \xe2\x80\x9cthe average person having bariatric surgery isn\xe2\x80\x99t doing a YouTube video.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Morton worries about what he calls social re-entry. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen they lose the weight, they are not always prepared,\xe2\x80\x9d he said'b'Tiffany Hunter can attest to that. She had the surgery when she was 15 and weighed 350 pounds. Now, 27 and 5-foot-11, she weighs 190.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBeing overweight, you think being skinny will solve all your problems,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t. It makes new problems that you don\xe2\x80\x99t know how to deal with.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She added, \xe2\x80\x9cYou think everyone will immediately like you because of how you look on the outside.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At 15, Tiffany was not only one of the first but also one of the youngest in the country to have the surgery at the time. But some bariatric surgeons wonder if adolescents and surgeons are waiting too long.'b'Dr. Daniels went from being shocked to hear at a meeting in 2003 that doctors were considering bariatric surgery for adolescents to wondering if a bar of a B.M.I. of 40 or 50 is too high. There was no real science behind those guidelines, he noted. He also worries about children who get fatter and fatter throughout childhood, reaching a level of obesity by adolescence that, even with surgery, will still leave them obese as they head into adulthood.'b'Dr. Michalsky shares those concerns.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can only expect so much out of these operations,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Michalsky said. The longer the teenagers wait for the surgery and the fatter they get, the less likely they are to reach a normal weight.'b'But how young is too young? Should it be done on children?'b'Dr. Morton said the only place he knows where surgeons have done bariatric surgery on children is Saudi Arabia. He and others think it is best to wait until puberty to avoid interfering with physical, mental and emotional development.'b'But, once again, doctors are acting on hunches, they say.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe get asked very often what is the lower age limit, but we really don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Michalsky said.'b'The Trump administration has mounted a vigorous defense of its ban on travel from seven majority-Muslim nations, saying it is necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the United States. But the ban, now 'b'blocked by a 'b'federal judge, also ensnared travelers important to the well-being of many Americans: doctors.'b'Foreign-born physicians have become crucial to the delivery of medical care in the United States. They work in small towns where there are no other doctors, in poor urban neighborhoods and in Veterans Affairs hospitals.'b'Foreign-born physicians \xe2\x80\x9care the doctors in small towns in Maine and Iowa,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Patricia F. Walker, the associate director of the University of Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s Global Health Pathway, which helps refugee doctors practice in the United States.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey go to the places where graduates of Harvard Medical School don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Across the United States, more than 15,000 doctors are from the seven Muslim-majority countries covered by the travel ban, according to The Medicus Firm, a firm that recruits doctors for hard-to-fill jobs. That includes almost 9,000 from Iran, almost 3,500 from Syria and more than 1,500 from Iraq.'b'Dr. Hooman Parsi, an oncologist so talented that he has an O-1 visa granted to individuals with \xe2\x80\x9c'b'extraordinary ability or achievement'b',\xe2\x80\x9d was to start seeing patients on Wednesday in San Bernardino, Calif.'b'A federal judge in Seattle lifted the administration\xe2\x80\x99s travel ban on Friday, and a federal appeals court has declined to restore it. Yet Dr. Parsi is still stuck in Iran, waiting for a delayed visa amid the confusion while his American employer fumes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe need him desperately,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Dr. Richy Agajanian'b', the managing partner of the Oncology Institute of Hope and Innovation, which had just hired him. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had an office completely constructed \xe2\x80\x94 we spent three months on it, and it was supposed to open Feb. 1. Now we can\xe2\x80\x99t open it. This is really sad and frustrating.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The 30-doctor practice does a lot of work in the Inland Empire, in San Bernardino and Riverside Counties, Dr. Agajanian noted. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very sparse in doctors out there \xe2\x80\x94 many miles between oncologists,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe patients he would be seeing have to travel another 25 miles now. Our doctors are already overworked, and now they\xe2\x80\x99ll have to be on call more often.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The United States has a persistent doctor shortage, even though 31 new medical schools have opened since 2002 and many existing ones have increased class sizes, according to Merritt Hawkins, a Dallas-based medical recruiting firm.'b'It also noted that there are 22 percent more residencies available each year than there are American graduates to take them. Graduates of foreign medical schools now fill that gap; the largest number come from India, followed by Pakistan, China, the Philippines, Iran and Israel.'b'(Iran is on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion list; Pakistan, a Muslim-majority country with a history of internal and external terror attacks, is not.)'b'Many foreign graduates have J-1 visas, which give them about three years to complete their residencies. \xe2\x80\x9cThey must pass licensing exams and they must do a residency to practice here, even if they\xe2\x80\x99re superstars where they come from,\xe2\x80\x9d said Phillip Miller, a Merritt Hawkins spokesman.'b'Foreign-born graduates have often worked at world-class institutions and have published academic papers, so they have higher average scores than American graduates on the medical knowledge portions of the licensing examinations, according to Merritt Hawkins research \xe2\x80\x94 though most initially score lower on the clinical skills portions, which include English and communication skills.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had to work my butt off to get here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Abdelghani el Rafei, a first-year resident at the University of Minnesota. \xe2\x80\x9cThey only take the top graduates from schools in countries like mine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such foreign-born graduates must return home when their visas expire, but they can get extensions if they agree to work in an area that the Department of Health and Human Services considers \xe2\x80\x9c'b'medically underserved'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which is roughly defined as having less than one primary care doctor for every 3,000 people.'b'Those who practice in an underserved area for several years can apply for green cards. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter that, they can practice anywhere, but at least you\xe2\x80\x99ve had three or four years of a physician in your town, and that\xe2\x80\x99s pretty significant,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Miller said.'b'Citing figures from the Iowa Board of Medicine, The Des Moines Register reported last week that 'b'172 doctors practicing in Iowa'b' were from the seven countries subject to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s travel ban, and that 23 percent of the state\xe2\x80\x99s 13,000 practicing doctors were born outside the United States.'b'Andrea Clement, a spokeswoman for Medicus, said that 76 percent of the foreign doctors it placed last year had gone to areas with fewer than 25,000 people or to small to medium-size cities of 25,000 to 500,000.'b'It placed more foreign doctors in Wisconsin than in any other state, she said, followed by California, Texas, Maryland, Oregon, Missouri, Tennessee, Ohio and Arizona.'b'Some urban areas are medically underserved, too. While Manhattan\xe2\x80\x99s Upper East Side has five times the number of doctors it needs to be adequately served under federal guidelines, parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn have acute doctor shortages.'b'More than 'b'150,000 residents of Brooklyn\xe2\x80\x99s Bedford-Stuyvesant section'b', for example, are rated as medically underserved under federal guidelines. One of the doctors stranded overseas last week, 'b'according to Pro Publica'b', was Dr. Kamal Fadlalla, an internal medicine specialist from Sudan who is a second-year resident at Interfaith Medical Center, which serves Bedford-Stuyvesant and Crown Heights.'b'Many foreign-born doctors, experts said, go into family medicine, pediatrics, internal medicine, general surgery and other front-line specialties where they see thousands of patients a year, including many on Medicare and Medicaid, rather than pursuing lucrative urban specialties like plastic surgery.'b'As an oncologist, Dr. Parsi was an exception. He moved to the United States in 2007 for postdoctoral work in molecular biology. Then, after passing his medical exam, he completed his residency at the University of Cincinnati and a fellowship in hematology and oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.'b'Because he had to leave the country to get his new visa stamped into his passport, he had flown to Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. He cleared a security vetting there, he said, but had to wait a few days for the visa, so he flew to Tehran to see his father.'b'But the new court ruling affects only those who had current visa stamps in their passport, so even though he is being issued a new visa, he still cannot return to the United States, he said on Saturday.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone, including me, would like to keep the bad people out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Naeem Moulki, a Syrian citizen who is finishing his medical residency in Minneapolis and plans to begin a cardiology fellowship in Chicago in the fall. \xe2\x80\x9cBut this is not the best way to do it. If I have to leave, it affects my patients.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. El Rafei said that the ban, which means he cannot go home to see his family, had depressed him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I was back in Syria again,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou feel hunted there, as if you did something wrong, even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t. Now I feel the same way here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He sees patients one day a week at the V.A. Hospital in Minneapolis, where he is sometimes asked where he is from.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of my patients, he was a veteran in his 60s, said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Why do you people hate us?\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI told him about Syria. I said: \xe2\x80\x98We don\xe2\x80\x99t hate you. The bad people you see on TV are the same people who make us suffer, too.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love this country,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a time in our residency when we can work in Africa or someplace. I want to work in a small American town, to show people that we\xe2\x80\x99re not all bad. The U.S. gives us a lot, so we want to give back what we can.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The 'b'World Health Organization'b' warned on Monday that a dozen 'b'antibiotic'b'-resistant \xe2\x80\x9csuperbugs\xe2\x80\x9d pose an enormous threat to human health, and urged hospital infection-control experts and pharmaceutical researchers to focus on fighting the most dangerous pathogens first.'b'The rate at which new strains of drug-resistant bacteria have emerged in recent years, prompted by overuse of antibiotics in humans and livestock, terrifies public health experts. Many consider the new strains just as dangerous as emerging viruses like 'b'Zika'b' or 'b'Ebola'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are fast running out of treatment options,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, the W.H.O. assistant director general who released the list. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we leave it to market forces alone, the new antibiotics we most urgently need are not going to be developed in time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Britain\xe2\x80\x99s chief medical officer, Sally C. Davies, 'b'has described drug-resistant pathogens'b' as a national security threat equivalent to terrorism, and Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the recently retired director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called them \xe2\x80\x9cone of our most serious health threats.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last week, the European Food Safety Authority and European Center for Disease Prevention and Control estimated that 'b'superbugs kill 25,000 Europeans'b' each year; the C.D.C. has estimated that they kill at least 23,000 Americans a year. (For comparison, 'b'about 38,000 Americans die in car crashes'b' yearly.)'b'Most of these deaths occur among older patients in hospitals or 'b'nursing homes'b', or among transplant and 'b'cancer'b' patients whose immune systems are suppressed. But some are among the young and healthy: A 'b'new study of 48 American pediatric hospitals'b' found that drug-resistant infections in children, while still rare, had increased sevenfold in eight years, which the authors called \xe2\x80\x9cominous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The W.H.O. report rated research on three pathogens as \xe2\x80\x9ccritical priority.\xe2\x80\x9d They are carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with all members of the Enterobacteriaceae family resistant to both carbapenems and third-generation cephalosporins.'b'(The Enterobacteriaceae family includes familiar names like E. coli and 'b'salmonella'b', which live in human and animal guts and can cause 'b'food poisoning'b', and Yersinia pestis, which causes 'b'bubonic plague'b'. Carbapenems and cephalosporins are each \xe2\x80\x9cfamilies\xe2\x80\x9d of related antibiotics; both break down bacterial cell walls.)'b'The W.H.O. listed six pathogens as \xe2\x80\x9chigh\xe2\x80\x9d priority. They include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, better known as 'b'MRSA'b', which is responsible for about a third of \xe2\x80\x9c'b'flesh-eating bacteria'b'\xe2\x80\x9d infections in the United States, and antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes 'b'gonorrhea'b'.'b'The W.H.O.\xe2\x80\x99s third category was \xe2\x80\x9cmedium priority,\xe2\x80\x9d which included drug-resistant versions of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and shigella, all three of which cause common childhood infections. For now, most of those infections are curable, but doctors fear that resistant strains will push out weaker ones.'b'Tuberculosis was not on the W.H.O.\xe2\x80\x99s list even though lethal drug-resistant strains \xe2\x80\x94 known as MDR-'b'TB'b' and XDR-TB \xe2\x80\x94 pose a major threat, because there are programs targeted at it.'b'New antibiotic candidates are in short supply, Dr. Kieny said, because 70 years of research have made it harder to find new ones, and because they are not very profitable for pharmaceutical companies. Patients are typically cured with a few pills and, to prevent the emergence of resistant strains, doctors are pressured to avoid prescribing the newest drugs except in extreme cases.'b'The W.H.O. hopes countries will consider ways to encourage more research. Britain has proposed $1 billion \xe2\x80\x9cprizes\xe2\x80\x9d for any new family discovered, and it and China have pledged $72 million toward a fund to support antibiotic research.'b'The agency would also like to see more collaboration between medical doctors and veterinarians, she said, because resistance that arises in animals can spread to humans.'b'The C.D.C. 'b'released a similar report in 2013'b', ranking 18 drug-resistant bacteria and fungi in three categories: urgent, serious and concerning.'b'The two lists have some differences, noted Jean B. Patel, a C.D.C. specialist in drug-resistant bacteria who consulted with the W.H.O. For example, N. gonorrhoeae was a higher priority on the C.D.C. list because it is hard to treat, even though it rarely kills; the W.H.O. list focused more on fatal infections.'b'The C.D.C. does not consider H. influenzae \xe2\x80\x94 better known as Hib \xe2\x80\x94 to be as big a threat as the W.H.O. does, she said, because nearly all American babies get Hib shots, which prevent it. In poor countries, according to 'b'a 2009 study'b', more than 300,000 children a year die of Hib-related 'b'meningitis'b' or 'b'pneumonia'b'.'b'Some bacteria resistant to all known antibiotics have been found. They are rare and, thus far, usually strike patients whose immune systems are weak. But once they take hold, they are virtually unstoppable, and victims usually die.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s useful for the W.H.O. to set global research priorities because drug-resistant strains are not evenly spread around the world. Some strains are more common on some continents, although jet travel and medical tourism are making most spread worldwide.'b'Strains can even vary within hospitals.'b'For example, the antibiotics used in a transplant unit often differ from those used in neonatal intensive care, so different resistant bacteria may circulate, said Dr. William Schaffner, head of 'b'preventive medicine'b' at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.'b'Infants in eastern Tennessee, he said, had more antibiotic-resistant ear infections than those in the state\xe2\x80\x99s western half or in many other states. Doctors there are \xe2\x80\x9cexuberant prescribers,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, which drives antibiotic resistance.'b'Resistance to carbapenems, which had been reliable \xe2\x80\x9clast line of defense\xe2\x80\x9d drugs, has developed recently among pathogens, as a gene first found in India in 2008 \xe2\x80\x94 and named NDM, for New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase \xe2\x80\x94 spread around the world.'b'The latest last-ditch antibiotic to start failing is colistin, which was invented in 1959 but shelved because it caused 'b'kidney damage'b'. Chinese pig farmers adopted it and feed nearly 12,000 tons to their pigs each year to speed their growth.'b'Drug-resistant strains were 'b'first found in China in 2015'b', with a disturbing aspect: the resistance-conferring gene was not in the bacteria\xe2\x80\x99s own DNA but on a plasmid, a small DNA ring that can jump from one bacterial species to another. The Chinese study 'b'found it in 21 percent of pigs sampled'b', and 1 percent of hospitalized humans. The 'b'first American patient with it'b' was found last year.'b'Colistin resistance \xe2\x80\x9csent shock waves through the medical and scientific communities,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Margaret Chan, the W.H.O.\xe2\x80\x99s director general, said last year. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we lose colistin, as several experts are predicting, we lose our last medicine for a number of serious infections.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the United States, although constant vigilance is crucial, the problem has actually declined in the last decade, said Dr. John Quale, an infectious disease specialist at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn who tracks resistance.'b'The W.H.O. list, Dr. Patel said, will also help a project the W.H.O. began in 2015, the 'b'Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re at a tipping point,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Patel said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can take action and turn the tide \xe2\x80\x94 or lose the drugs we have.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'During her 'b'pregnancy'b', she never drank alcohol or had a cigarette. But nearly every day, Stacey, then 24, smoked marijuana.'b'With her fianc\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s blessing, she began taking a few puffs in her first trimester to quell 'b'morning sickness'b' before going to work at a sandwich shop. When 'b'sciatica'b' made it unbearable to stand during her 12-hour shifts, she discreetly vaped marijuana oil on her lunch break.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily say, \xe2\x80\x98Go smoke a pound of pot when you\xe2\x80\x99re pregnant,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Stacey, now a stay-at-home mother in Deltona, Fla., who asked that her full name be withheld because street-bought marijuana is illegal in Florida. \xe2\x80\x9cIn moderation, it\xe2\x80\x99s O.K.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many pregnant women, particularly younger ones, seem to agree, a recent federal survey shows. As states legalize marijuana or its medical use, expectant mothers are taking it up in increasing numbers \xe2\x80\x94 another example of the many ways in which acceptance of marijuana has outstripped scientific understanding of its effects on human health.'b'Often pregnant women presume that cannabis has no consequences for developing infants. But preliminary research suggests otherwise: Marijuana\xe2\x80\x99s main psychoactive ingredient \xe2\x80\x94 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC \xe2\x80\x94 can cross the placenta to reach the fetus, experts say, potentially harming brain development, cognition and birth weight. THC can also be present in 'b'breast milk'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is an increased perception of the safety of cannabis use, even in pregnancy, without data to say it\xe2\x80\x99s actually safe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Torri Metz, an obstetrician at Denver Health Medical Center who specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Ten percent of her patients acknowledge recent marijuana use.'b'In the 'b'federal 'b''b' survey'b', published online in December, almost 4 percent of mothers-to-be said they had used marijuana in the past month in 2014, compared with 2.4 percent in 2002. (By comparison, roughly 9 percent of pregnant women ages 18 to 44 'b'acknowledge using alcohol in the previous month'b'.)'b'Young mothers-to-be were particularly likely to turn to marijuana: Roughly 7.5 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said they had used pot in the past month in 2014, compared with 2 percent of women ages 26 to 44.'b'Evidence on the effects of prenatal marijuana use is still limited and sometimes contradictory. Some of the most extensive data come from two sets of researchers, in Pittsburgh and in Ottawa, who have long studied children exposed to THC in the womb.'b'In Pittsburgh, 6-year-olds born to mothers who had smoked one joint or more daily in the first trimester showed a decreased ability to understand concepts in listening and reading. 'b'At age 10'b', children exposed to THC in utero were more impulsive than other children and less able to focus their attention.'b'Most troubling, children of mothers who used marijuana heavily in the first trimester had lower scores in reading, math and spelling at age 14 than their peers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPrenatal exposure can affect the adolescent pretty significantly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Lauren M. Jansson, the director of pediatrics at the Center for Addiction and Pregnancy at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.'b'Several studies have found changes in the brains of fetuses, 18 to 22 weeks old, linked to maternal marijuana use. In male fetuses who were exposed, for instance, researchers have noted abnormal function of the amygdala, the part of the brain that regulates emotion.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven early in development, marijuana is changing critical circuits and neurotransmitting receptors,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Yasmin Hurd, a neuroscientist and the director of the addiction center at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in Manhattan. \xe2\x80\x9cThose are important for regulation of emotions and reward, even motor function and cognition.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is already well documented that the developing brains of teenagers can be altered with regular marijuana use, even 'b'eventually reducing 'b''b'I.Q.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe effects are not dramatic, but that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they are not important,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jodi Gilman, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School who studies adolescent users of cannabis. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could make the difference between getting an A and getting a B.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou could imagine that a similar subtle effect may be present in those who were exposed prenatally to marijuana,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.'b'The 'b'American Academy of Pediatrics'b' and the 'b'American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists'b' both advise against prenatal cannabis use because of its links to cognitive impairment and academic underachievement. But many state and federal agencies avoid the topic.'b'Of five federal agencies, only the National Institute on Drug Abuse had any information about prenatal marijuana use on its website as of last February, according to a study 'b'published 'b''b'online in December'b' in the journal Substance Abuse. Only 10 state health departments did.'b'Until recently, the 'b'Centers for Disease Control and Prevention'b' offered nothing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think public health officials should be alarming people,\xe2\x80\x9d said Marian Jarlenski, the study\xe2\x80\x99s lead author and an assistant professor at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. \xe2\x80\x9cThey just have to say, \xe2\x80\x98There have been studies done, and there is some risk.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a statement, C.D.C. officials expressed concern about memory and attention problems among children exposed to THC in utero.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile current evidence on health consequences is inconsistent, some studies have found risks associated with marijuana use during pregnancy, such as low birth weight or preterm birth,\xe2\x80\x9d the agency said.'b'Dr. Marie McCormick, a pediatrician and the chairwoman of a new 'b'report'b' on cannabis from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, said smoking cannabis \xe2\x80\x9cdoes confer, in terms of birth weight, the same risk as cigarettes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some of the gathering evidence is reassuring. So far, prenatal cannabis exposure does not appear to be linked to obvious 'b'birth defects'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s why some providers and lay people alike think there\xe2\x80\x99s no effect,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Erica Wymore, a neonatologist at Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital Colorado. But she warned, \xe2\x80\x9cJust because they don\xe2\x80\x99t have a major birth defect or overt withdrawal symptoms doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the baby\xe2\x80\x99s neurological development is not impacted.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most research in this area was done when the drug was far less potent. Marijuana had 12 percent THC in 2014, while in 1995 it was just 4 percent, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll those really good earlier studies on marijuana effects aren\xe2\x80\x99t telling us what we need to know now about higher concentration levels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Therese Grant, an epidemiologist and director of the University of Washington\xe2\x80\x99s fetal alcohol and drug unit. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to do a whole lot more research now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are two additional problems with studies of maternal cannabis use. Research is often based on reports by pregnant women \xe2\x80\x94 instead of, say, tests of urine or the umbilical cord \xe2\x80\x94 and they consistently underreport their use. (Researchers know of underreporting because samples reveal discrepancies.) And pregnant women who roll joints also tend to smoke tobacco or drink alcohol; it can be hard to tease out the risks of cannabis itself.'b'Few realize that THC is stored in fat and therefore can linger in a mother\xe2\x80\x99s body for weeks, if not months. It\xe2\x80\x99s not known whether the fetus\xe2\x80\x99s exposure is limited to the hours a woman feels high.'b'The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises clinicians to ask pregnant women about marijuana use and to urge them to quit.'b'To find out whether that\xe2\x80\x99s happening, Dr. Judy Chang, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Pittsburgh, and her colleagues recorded more than 450 first visits with pregnant patients.'b'Medical staff were more likely to warn patients that child protective services might be called if they used marijuana, the researchers found, than to advise them of potential risks. When mothers-to-be admitted to marijuana use, almost half of obstetric clinicians did not respond at all.'b'Pregnant women aren\xe2\x80\x99t eager to discuss it, either, because they are afraid of legal repercussions or a lecture.'b'Depression, anxiety, stress, pain, 'b'nausea and vomiting'b' were the most common reasons women reported using marijuana in a 2014 'b'survey'b' of low-income mothers getting federal nutrition help in Colorado. Roughly 6 percent were pot users; a third were pregnant.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWomen are thinking of this as 'b'medical marijuana'b' in that they are treating some condition,\xe2\x80\x9d said Elizabeth Nash, a policy analyst at the Guttmacher Institute who researches 'b'substance abuse'b' in pregnancy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re going to consider it like medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen treat it like medicine and talk to your doctor about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Stacey\xe2\x80\x99s son just had his first birthday.

But the severe cramps that plagued her before pregnancy are easing now.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have to smoke as much anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'MANCHESTER, N.H. \xe2\x80\x94 Chad Diaz began using heroin when he was 12. Now 36 and newly covered by Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, he is on Suboxone, a substitute opioid that eases withdrawal symptoms and cravings, and he is slowly pulling himself together.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the best my life has gone in many, many years,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Diaz, a big man wearing camouflage, said as he sat in a community health center here.'b'If Congress and President Trump succeed in dismantling the Affordable Care Act, he will have no insurance to pay for his medication or counseling, and he fears he will slide back to heroin.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf this gets taken from me, it\xe2\x80\x99s right back to Square 1,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s not a good place. I\xe2\x80\x99m scary when I\xe2\x80\x99m using. I don\xe2\x80\x99t care who I hurt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the debate over the fate of the health law intensifies, proponents have focused on the lifesaving care it has brought to people with cancer, diabetes and other physical illnesses. But the law has also had a profound, though perhaps less heralded, effect on mental health and addiction treatment, vastly expanding access to those services by designating them as \xe2\x80\x9cessential benefits\xe2\x80\x9d that must be covered through the A.C.A. marketplaces and expanded Medicaid.'b'The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research group, calculates that 2.8 million people with substance use disorders, including 220,000 with opioid disorders, have coverage under the A.C.A. As the opioid epidemic continues to devastate communities nationwide, public health officials say the law has begun to make a critical difference in their ability to treat and rehabilitate people.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the illnesses, this is one where we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen very dramatic changes and where we stand to lose the most ground if we lose the A.C.A.,\xe2\x80\x9d said Linda Rosenberg, president and chief executive of the National Council for Behavioral Health, adding that treatment programs have begun to be integrated into primary care clinics and health care systems nationwide.'b'During the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump pledged to rid the country of Obamacare but also to address the opioid epidemic and expand access to drug treatment. Many of the states hardest hit by opioids \xe2\x80\x94 including Ohio, West Virginia and Kentucky \xe2\x80\x94 voted for Mr. Trump, but some Republican governors have expressed concern about what might happen to people being treated for addiction if their party repeals or scales back the health law.'b'John Kasich, the Republican governor of Ohio, where the Medicaid expansion has covered 700,000 people, has been particularly outspoken about its success in his state. \xe2\x80\x9cThank God we expanded Medicaid because that Medicaid money is helping to rehab people,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kasich said during a bill signing in January.'b'There is still a long way to go. Waiting lists for treatment persist, and many people still lack access, particularly in the 19 states that have opted not to expand Medicaid. Nationwide, 78 people die every day from opioid overdoses, according to the surgeon general, and the number is still rising. And paradoxically, even as the number of opioid prescriptions in the United States has finally started 'b'falling'b', expanded health coverage has probably made it easier for some people to obtain the drugs.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in my mind that improving access to health care during an era in which opioids are being overprescribed would lead to more addiction,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing and an addiction specialist.'b'While 23 million Americans suffer from a substance use disorder, the surgeon general said in a report last year that only one in 10 was receiving treatment as of 2014, the first year people got coverage through the health law. \xe2\x80\x9cNow what we\xe2\x80\x99re doing is playing catch-up,\xe2\x80\x9d said Michael Botticelli, director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy during the last two years of the Obama administration.'b'In the past, a third of private insurance plans sold on the individual market did not cover addiction treatment, according to federal health officials, and those that did imposed strict limits. Medicaid covered little besides inpatient detox. Now, more health care providers are offering and getting reimbursed for outpatient counseling and medications like Suboxone and Vivitrol, which have been shown to reduce the potential for relapse.'b'The health law encourages primary care doctors to incorporate addiction treatment into their practices. It provided grants to several hundred community health centers around the country, many in rural areas, to begin or expand mental health and medication-assisted treatment, which combines counseling and drugs like Suboxone.'b'This is a big improvement from the days when treatment typically was offered through scattered, poorly funded stand-alone clinics that did not necessarily provide evidence-based treatment and had long waiting lists, said Richard Frank, a professor of health economics at Harvard Medical School.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole system is being pushed more toward looking like modern health care,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Frank, who worked at the Department of Health and Human Services in the Obama administration.'b'The 21st Century Cures Act, which Congress passed in December with strong bipartisan support, could build on the progress by providing $1 billion nationwide over the next two years to expand drug treatment around the country, with an emphasis on medication-assisted treatment. The federal government will soon begin distributing the money to states, which will allot it to treatment programs, particularly in high-need areas. But if people lose their insurance, Dr. Frank said, they may well lose access to these new options.'b'In Kentucky about 11,000 people were receiving addiction treatment through Medicaid by mid-2016, up sharply from 1,500 people in early 2014, 'b'according'b' to the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, a health policy research group. In West Virginia, Ms. Rosenberg of the National Council for Behavioral Health said, her group\xe2\x80\x99s member organizations \xe2\x80\x94 nonprofit providers of mental health and addiction treatment \xe2\x80\x94 are now treating 30,000 people a year, up from 9,000 before the health law.'b'Here in New Hampshire \xe2\x80\x94 which Mr. Trump won resoundingly in the Republican primary and lost by a hair in November \xe2\x80\x94 more than 10,000 people have received addiction treatment after gaining coverage through the Medicaid expansion, said Michele Merritt, senior vice president and policy director at New Futures, a nonprofit advocacy group. Small treatment centers throughout the state that had never been able to bill insurance before have started doing so, she said, allowing them to hire more counselors and accept more patients.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just beginning to implement these exchanges in a way that people know about them,\xe2\x80\x9d said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, referring to the exchanges created under the health law. Getting rid of them, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cmakes no sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Others note that even with more treatment options, the number of deaths in places like New Hampshire continues to rise. The state ranks first nationwide in per capita overdose deaths from fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid that is now killing more people here than heroin. Republicans here have also criticized state health officials for not tracking how many Medicaid enrollees who receive addiction treatment end up relapsing.'b'In Pennsylvania, where 124,000 people have received addiction treatment under the Medicaid expansion, health officials were disturbed by early data showing that two-thirds of those who went to detox got no other treatment services. So Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, is designating 45 \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Centers of Excellence'b'\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 primary care clinics where people can also get addiction and mental health treatment, with frequent follow-up and a team of providers closely tracking their progress.'b'The new model is in use here at the Manchester Community Health Center, where Mr. Diaz receives treatment. The center had offered minimal services for substance abuse before the health law.'b'Now, three years later, it has undergone substantial changes. More than 40 percent of its patients had been uninsured; today, only 20 percent are. The center used to have one building, a staff of 55 and 7,500 patients; today, it has clinics in four locations, a staff of 230 and more than 16,000 patients, about 800 of whom have substance abuse issues.'b'It has two providers who are licensed to prescribe medication-assisted treatment, which it is expanding to 60 patients, including pregnant women, the center\xe2\x80\x99s priority. \xe2\x80\x9cThe number may sound low as far as how many we\xe2\x80\x99re treating,\xe2\x80\x9d said Julie Hazell-Felch, director of behavioral health at the center. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s a multitude of services they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving and they\xe2\x80\x99re in here weekly,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, seeing nurses, a behavioral health clinician and a medical provider, and giving urine samples and receiving their medications.'b'If the Affordable Care Act is repealed, the center stands to lose more than $6 million in funding, mostly Medicaid revenue, about a third of its $18 million annual budget.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe would not be able to keep all four sites open,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kris McCracken, president and chief executive of the health center.'b'She added: \xe2\x80\x9cThere are only two avenues to go: You either prevent and treat, or you street. That\xe2\x80\x99s what will happen. People will end up back on the street.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like a man on a flying trapeze, K.T. Jones has leapt from one medical study to another during his 15-year struggle with 'b'cancer'b', and he has no doubt that the experimental treatments he has received have saved his life.'b'Mr. Jones, 45, has an aggressive type of Hodgkin\xe2\x80\x99s lymphoma that resists the usual therapies. At the start of his most recent clinical trial, his life expectancy was measured in months. That was more than three years ago. He received a drug that helped his immune system fight cancer \xe2\x80\x94 a type 'b'of immunotherapy'b', the hottest area in cancer research and treatment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been over 12 months now with no treatment at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI walk half-marathons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Jones is one of many patients who have benefited from lifesaving advances in immunotherapy. But he\xe2\x80\x99s an outlier: He is African-American. As money pours into immunotherapy research and promising results multiply, patients getting the new treatments in studies have been overwhelmingly white. Minority participation in most clinical trials is low, often out of proportion with the groups\xe2\x80\x99 numbers in the general population and their cancer rates. Many researchers acknowledge the imbalance, and say they are trying to correct it.'b'Two major studies of immunotherapy last year starkly illustrate the problem. The drug being tested was nivolumab, a type of checkpoint inhibitor, one of the most promising drug classes for cancer. In both studies, patients taking it lived significantly longer than those given 'b'chemotherapy'b'.'b'In the first 'b'study, of 582 patients with lung cancer'b', 92 percent were white. Three percent were black, 3 percent were Asian and 3 percent were listed as \xe2\x80\x9cother.\xe2\x80\x9d In the second 'b'study, of 821 people with kidney'b' cancer, 88 percent were white, 9 percent Asian and just 1 percent black.'b'According to 2015 census figures, whites make up 77 percent of the United States population, blacks 13.3 percent and Asians 5.6 percent.'b'A 1993 law requires that all medical research conducted or paid for by the National Institutes of Health include enough minorities and women to determine whether they respond to treatment differently than other groups. Minority enrollment in its studies was about 28 percent in clinical research and 40 percent in Phase III clinical trials in 2015, the N.I.H. said.'b'But the 'b'N.I.H. paid for only about 6 percent'b' of all clinical trials in the United States in 2014, and those it does not support do not have to adhere to its rules. The lung and kidney studies of nivolumab, for instance, were paid for by the drug\xe2\x80\x99s maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb. Researchers say such studies, geared toward getting a drug approved for new uses, are often done quickly, and minority patients may be left out because it can take longer to find and enroll them.'b'One obstacle, researchers say, is that people in minority groups tend to have lower incomes and less education, and therefore less awareness of medical studies and how to find them. Many live in areas that do not have easy access to a major cancer center. Moreover, minority patients with cancer are more likely to have other, poorly controlled chronic diseases like 'b'diabetes'b' that may make them ineligible for studies, according to Dr. Julie R. Brahmer, from the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.'b'Even if they do qualify and want to enroll, financial hurdles can be daunting. Studies may involve frequent trips to the hospital, requiring time off work and expenses for travel, parking and child care. Some doctors simply assume that lower-income, minority patients could not manage it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the biggest barriers is doctors not asking patients to join clinical trials because they assume they would not be trial candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Elise D. Cook, from the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. But many, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould participate if they were asked.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Trials can offer huge advantages, like new treatments that may otherwise be unavailable. Expensive drugs and tests are usually free. The overall care is often better than routine treatment, because patients see doctors and nurses more frequently and have more tests. Though success is not guaranteed, a clinical trial can be a lifeline.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cClinical trials are the most advanced treatment, the most cutting-edge therapies we have,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dina G. Lansey, the assistant director for diversity and inclusion in clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center. \xe2\x80\x9cThey should be available to everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At Queens Hospital\xe2\x80\x99s Cancer Center in New York, researchers are trying to reach disadvantaged patients by bringing clinical trials to them.'b'For one black patient there this fall, chemotherapy had stopped working and his 'b'colon cancer'b' was spreading.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s something you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hear,\xe2\x80\x9d said the patient, a slight, sad-faced man of 61 with a soft voice and a strong Jamaican accent. He asked to be identified only as Mr. M., to protect his privacy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe all have to go,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Linda Bulone, a research nurse manager, was hoping to buy him some time with a study that would test for mutations that might make his cancer vulnerable to certain new drugs, which he could then receive.'b'Her effort was part of an unusual collaboration between the Queens center, where 92 percent of patients are from minority groups, and 'b'Memorial 'b''b' Sloan Kettering Cancer Center'b', one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s most renowned cancer hospitals.'b'Opened in 2002 by Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny, a surgical oncologist and professor of surgery at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, the Queens center is part of NYC Health &amp; Hospitals/Queens, a public hospital that turns no one away. Many patients there are uninsured; 85 percent of those with cancer qualify for emergency 'b'Medicaid'b', Dr. Kemeny said. The cancer center operates a food pantry, and many patients need it.'b'Dr. Kemeny wanted cancer patients to have access to studies, and lured Ms. Bulone away from a tony suburban hospital to start a research center in 2004.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t do good medicine for cancer without a research program,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Kemeny said. Most of her patients in Queens have never heard of clinical trials.'b'Mr. M., for instance, knew nothing about 'b'genetics'b', mutations or Memorial Sloan Kettering. Sensing that he, like many of her patients, had trouble reading, Ms. Bulone took most of an hour to read the consent form for the study aloud and explain it. He signed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnce you\xe2\x80\x99re in the study, you\xe2\x80\x99re a patient of mine forever,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Bulone told him. As she does with every study patient, she gave him her cellphone number and said he could call her any time night or day. He hugged her on the way out.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t convince them of anything,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI educate them. We have to protect them, inform them, make sure they\xe2\x80\x99re getting a true impression of the study. Not every clinical trial is for every person.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The center has patients in about 35 trials, she said, adding that drug companies looking to enroll minorities sometimes seek out the Queens center because it\xe2\x80\x99s such a melting pot. Though she is white, she has had no trouble signing up patients from other races, she said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to really care,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to put yourself into it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She said it was important to work with patients who are illiterate or have little education, factors that some may think would impede their ability to follow directions, and make them poor candidates for clinical trials. She considers that discriminatory.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe want to give them the best treatment we can,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there\xe2\x80\x99s also the emotional part. That\xe2\x80\x99s all you have left when the medicine runs out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Bulone uses a telephone translating service to explain studies to patients who do not speak English, and the hospital or drug companies pay $2,000 to $6,000 to have consent forms translated.'b'To find patients who might be helped but know nothing of trials, she recently began asking another city hospital for its list of patients to be discussed at its \xe2\x80\x9ctumor board\xe2\x80\x9d meetings, where doctors evaluate difficult cases.'b'If any patients meet the criteria for a study, she contacts them. Recently, she found Sung Yoo, a Korean man with 'b'gastric cancer'b' who qualified for a promising study of a checkpoint inhibitor. It took 16 days to get the consent form translated, but he waited and eagerly signed up.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople want to live,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Bulone said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey just do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Clinical trials can reveal things useful to a whole ethnic or racial group. For instance, a drug for 'b'kidney cancer'b', sunitinib, has proved more likely to cause skin problems in Asians than in whites. But how blacks compare is not known, because not enough have been included in studies, said Dr. Robert J. Motzer, an oncologist at Sloan Kettering.'b'But Dr. Otis W. Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we look at race, it matters sociopolitically far more than biologically.\xe2\x80\x9d He said lower enrollment of minorities in clinical trials was part of a larger problem of unequal care that contributes to higher death rates from treatable cancers in some groups.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI sometimes cynically say, \xe2\x80\x98The drug certainly does not work in blacks when blacks don\xe2\x80\x99t get prescribed the drug,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Brawley said.'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen there\xe2\x80\x99s a rumor that a new drug is hot, if it is being offered, upper-class Americans with good insurance will fly to the medical center, stay in a hotel, get on the trial.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The notorious Tuskeegee study, in which black men with 'b'syphilis'b' were deliberately left untreated during the mid-20th century, is frequently cited as a reason that blacks avoid studies. But once the safeguards to prevent abuse are explained, researchers said, minorities are just as willing as whites to participate. Most people are wary of studies with control groups given placebos, but cancer studies do not use placebos: The control group generally gets the best available standard care.'b'One way to increase minority enrollment that some researchers favor is conducting studies that focus on specific racial or ethnic groups. Few such studies are done, though Dr. Brawley warned that requiring certain enrollment levels for minorities could backfire, tempting research teams to pressure patients to sign up.'b'Another solution, some suggest, would be for medical journals to refuse to publish studies unless they include appropriate numbers of women and minorities.'b'Dr. Edward W. Campion, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, wrote in an email that his publication expects reports of trials to show racial distributions,\xe2\x80\x9cbut there are no set requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A complicating factor, he said, is that many major studies are international, including countries with different racial makeups.'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe expect it to be made clear that one has to be careful about generalizing from a trial done mainly in one racial group.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There were 23 people in the small study that probably saved Mr. Jones\xe2\x80\x99s life. He was one of two blacks \xe2\x80\x94 a higher proportion than in most larger studies.'b'Mr. Jones said that he was unaware of any racial divide in research, and that his stubborn personality and determination to live drove him to find studies, entirely on his own.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI made a commitment to a lifetime with my wife,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cA lifetime wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be a year or two.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His quest began when his lymphoma returned after several rounds of treatment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy doctor sat me down and said, \xe2\x80\x98The disease seems to have progressed past everything we have,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jones said. The doctor then promised he would make sure to keep Mr. Jones comfortable.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou mean tie up loose ends?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Jones asked. When the doctor said yes, Mr. Jones said, \xe2\x80\x9cI gave him a hug, and said: \xe2\x80\x98This means my journey with you is done. I\xe2\x80\x99m going to find something, somewhere. I\xe2\x80\x99ll keep you in the loop.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He scoured 'b'ClinicalTrials.gov'b', which lists available studies for many diseases. A drug name he saw there led him to an online video describing a study at 'b'MD Anderson Cancer Center'b' for patients like him. Mr. Jones lives in Delaware and thought MD stood for Maryland, a few hours\xe2\x80\x99 drive away. He was stunned to find out the hospital was in Houston. He and his wife had to stop paying their mortgage to afford plane tickets. Eventually, they lost their house. But the treatment worked \xe2\x80\x94 for a while.'b'When he relapsed again, he could not afford to keep traveling to MD Anderson. His doctor there helped him transfer his care to Sloan Kettering in New York.'b'Again, experimental treatments helped, but temporarily. Then he hit the jackpot. In 2013, he entered a trial of the checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. He was treated for two years. The 'b'study became a landmark'b', with an 87 percent response rate among patients like Mr. Jones, who had burned through every other option.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was just hitting it out of the park,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Alexander M. Lesokhin, his oncologist at Sloan Kettering.'b'Mr. Jones was treated for two years. His tumors shrank, and he has been off treatment for a year. Doctors are not sure whether the cancer is gone or being kept at bay by his immune system. But he is feeling well and has embarked on a new career that he loves, photographing jazz musicians.'b'As for his illness, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a specific person to guide me. Everything fell into place for me because I pushed for it. I\xe2\x80\x99m telling everyone else: \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t give up. You have to self-advocate.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She was all there, all the time: exuberant in describing her mania, savage and tender when recalling her despair.'b'And for decades, she gracefully wore the legacy of her legendary role as Princess Leia, worshiped by a generation of teenage girls as the lone female warrior amid the galactic male cast of the \xe2\x80\x9cStar Wars\xe2\x80\x9d trilogy.'b'In her long, openhearted life, the actress and author 'b'Carrie Fisher'b' brought the subject of 'b'bipolar disorder'b' into the popular culture with such humor and hard-boiled detail that 'b'her death on Tuesday'b' triggered a wave of affection on social media and elsewhere, from both fans and fellow bipolar travelers, whose emotional language she knew and enriched. She channeled the spirit of people like 'b'Patty Duke'b', who wrote about her own bipolar illness, and Kitty Dukakis, who wrote about depression and 'b'alcoholism'b', and turned it into performance art.'b'Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s career coincided with the growing interest in bipolar disorder itself, a mood disorder characterized by alternating highs and lows, paralyzing depressions punctuated by flights of exuberant energy.'b'Her success fed a longstanding debate on the relationship between mental turmoil and creativity. And her writing and speaking helped usher in a confessional era in which mental disorders have entered the pop culture with a life of their own: Bipolar is now a prominent trait of another famous Carrie, Claire Danes\xe2\x80\x99s character Carrie Mathison in the Showtime television series \xe2\x80\x9cHomeland.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe was so important to the public because she was telling the truth about bipolar disorder, not putting on airs or pontificating, just sharing who she is in an honest-to-the-bone way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judith Schlesinger, a psychologist and author of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Insanity Hoax: Exposing the Myth of the Mad Genius.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a characteristic riff, answering a question about the disorder from the audience at the 'b'Indiana Comic-Con 'b' last year, Ms. Fisher said: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a kind of virus of the brain that makes you go very fast or very sad. Or both. Those are fun days. So judgment isn\xe2\x80\x99t, like, one of my big good things. But I have a good voice. I can write well. I\xe2\x80\x99m not a good bicycle rider. So, just like anybody else, only louder and faster and sleeps more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She then grabbed the mike and sang, in mock-ballad voice, \xe2\x80\x9cOh manic depression \xe2\x80\xa6 oh how I love you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That last line is a reminder too, that in Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s lifetime, even the name of the condition had evolved, to bipolar from what was once more commonly known as manic depression.'b'Ms. Fisher has said that she was first given a diagnosis of bipolar disorder at age 24 but did not 'b'accept it'b' until five years later. In time, she spoke often about her lifelong struggles with both addiction and bipolar disorder and her desire to erase the stigma of mental illness. She wrote her 1987 novel, \xe2\x80\x9cPostcards From the Edge,\xe2\x80\x9d after a stint in rehab after a near-fatal drug overdose. It was during her autobiographical one-woman stage show, \xe2\x80\x9cWishful Drinking,\xe2\x80\x9d that she first posited the idea for \xe2\x80\x9cBipolar Pride Day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like the disorder itself, the wave of attention that occurred during Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s life had its excesses. Through the 1990s, research scientists \xe2\x80\x94 many of them supported by drugmakers \xe2\x80\x94 expanded the definition of the disorder, describing \xe2\x80\x9csub-syndromes\xe2\x80\x9d and permutations like bipolar II and \xe2\x80\x9chypomania.\xe2\x80\x9d By the 2000s, doctors were diagnosing the condition in groups of people who had never been identified before, mostly young children \xe2\x80\x94 leading to thousands of children being unnecessarily treated with strong psychiatric drugs.'b'In recent years, that overheated enthusiasm has finally begun to run its course.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI remember being at a psychiatric association event where Carrie Fisher was interviewed, and people were beginning to talk about the imperialism of bipolar,\xe2\x80\x9d how the diagnosis was expanding beyond its bounds, said David Miklowitz, a professor of psychiatry at the 'b'Semel Institute'b' at the University of California, Los Angeles. He added, \xe2\x80\x9cI think doctors are much more careful now, in being sure they\xe2\x80\x99re diagnosing the real thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The American Psychiatric Association\xe2\x80\x99s latest diagnostic manual discourages applying the label to young children.'b'Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s vivid prose, wicked humor and striking performances inevitably led many people, including herself, to wonder whether bipolar mania fuels creativity.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy experience is that it does spur creativity and insights and the ability to express connections you see but could not otherwise express,\xe2\x80\x9d said Terri Cheney, author of the best-selling memoir \xe2\x80\x9cManic.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBut normalcy is so much preferable, being able to remember what I did \xe2\x80\x94 I tend to forget manic episodes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Scientists, scholars and writers have speculated for years about the connection between madness, and in particular mania, and artistic wizardry. The painters Edvard Munch and Vincent van Gogh, among many others, have been posthumously diagnosed with bipolar disorder.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a particular kind of pain, elation, loneliness and terror involved in this kind of madness,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote the psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison, a prominent proponent of this connection. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re high, it\xe2\x80\x99s tremendous. The ideas and feelings are fast and frequent like shooting stars, and you follow them until you find better and brighter ones.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the debate remains contentious, and given the vagueness of so many diagnoses, not to mention the devastating effect of depression or 'b'psychosis'b' on discipline and concentration, it is unlikely to be settled anytime soon.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe case has really been built on sand,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Schlesinger said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been oversold.\xe2\x80\x9d She added, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery course of bipolar is different, there is no one progression, no one symptomology, no one cure, so the effects are very individual.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All the more reason that one particularly outspoken, charismatic and large personality could project so much toughness and vulnerability at the same time. Ms. Fisher learned to live a public life at a very early age, as the child of celebrities and with her early stardom.'b'In an 'b'interview 'b'with CBS this year, she said she liked being Princess Leia, understanding that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s a great role for women.\xe2\x80\x9d But, she added: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not really one of those actresses like Meryl Streep. Those actresses travel outside themselves and play characters. And I\xe2\x80\x99m more of an archaeologist. I play what I am.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy, visibility and public self-examination was made for the era of online self-confession. For good and bad, in part because of Ms. Fisher\xe2\x80\x99s example, the language of bipolar and mental disorders has swept into the shared popular culture, seeding online support groups, punctuating texted exchanges \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cso 'b'OCD'b'\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and becoming featured in dimensions of movies and TV shows like \xe2\x80\x9cMonk\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHomeland.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Paul Cumming, a longtime advocate in San Diego who works for a company that helps people with mental disorders find housing, said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe power of celebrity was best shown by Carrie that by being public, and funny, she demystified our diagnosis and showed by example we can live well and thrive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The death rate from 'b'cervical cancer'b' in the United States is considerably higher than previously estimated and the disparity in death rates between black women and white women is significantly wider, according to a 'b'study'b' published Monday in the journal Cancer.'b'The rate at which black American women are dying from the disease is comparable to that of women in many poor developing nations, researchers reported. What makes the findings especially disturbing, said experts not involved in the research, is that when screening guidelines and follow-up monitoring are pursued, cervical cancer is largely preventable.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis shows that our disparities are even worse than we feared,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Dr. Kathleen M. Schmeler'b', an associate professor of gynecologic oncology at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have screenings that are great, but many women in America are not getting them. And now I have even more concerns going forward, with the\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 expected \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9crepeal of the Affordable Care Act, which covers screening, and the closing of family planning clinics, which do much of that screening.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The racial disparity had been noted in earlier studies, but it had been thought to have narrowed because cervical cancer death rates for black women were declining. But this study said that the gap was far greater than believed.'b'In the new analysis, the mortality rate for black women was 10.1 per 100,000. For white women, it is 4.7 per 100,000.'b'Previous studies had put those figures at 5.7 and 3.2.'b'The new rates do not reflect a rise in the number of deaths, which recent estimates put at more than 4,000 a year in the United States. Instead, the figures come from a re-examination of existing numbers, in an adjusted context.'b'Typically, death rates for cervical cancer are calculated by assessing the number of women who die from a disease against the general population at risk for it. But these epidemiologists, who looked at health data from 2000 to 2012, also excluded women who had had 'b'hysterectomies'b' from that larger population. A hysterectomy almost always removes the cervix, and thus the possibility that a woman will develop cervical cancer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t include men in our calculation because they are not at risk for cervical cancer and by the same measure, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t include women who don\xe2\x80\x99t have a cervix,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Anne F. Rositch'b', the lead author and an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we want to look at how well our programs are doing, we have to look at the women we\xe2\x80\x99re targeting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although the study did not explore reasons for the racial disparity, some doctors said it could reflect unequal access to screening, ability to pursue early-warning test results, and insurance coverage. A recent 'b'study'b' in the journal Gynecologic Oncology that looked at 15,194 patients with advanced cervical cancer found that more than half did not receive treatment considered to be standard of care, and that those patients were more likely to be black and poor.'b'According to the analysis published Monday, the hysterectomy-corrected mortality rates put black American women on par with women living in some underdeveloped countries in Latin America, Asia and Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.'b'Certainly removing women who had hysterectomies from the data pool had a significant effect. About 20 percent of women in the United States have a hysterectomy, often for problems unrelated to 'b'cancer'b', like excessive bleeding and 'b'fibroids'b', with prevalence higher among black women than white.'b'In years to come, mortality and incidence rates should decline as more women receive HPV vaccines, which prevents many cervical cancers.'b'In recent years, with recognition of the slow progression of the disease, the success of the vaccine and more sophisticated screening tests, 'b'guidelines for cervical cancer assessments'b' have shifted. Depending on circumstances, some women need to be screened only every five years.'b'The guidelines suggest that screening end at age 65 for women who have had two or three consecutive negative results in the previous decade.'b'The current study says that the greatest mortality rates hit black women 85 and older.'b'But experts said the new findings did not necessarily point to the need to revisit the upper end of the guidelines. Cervical cancer progresses so slowly, with so many early-warning stages, experts said, that it is highly unlikely that a 65-year-old woman who had met guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 requirements would subsequently develop the disease.'b'But given the rigor of the guidelines and screenings, Dr. Rositch said, why do American women not only still get cervical cancer but die from it? And with such pronounced racial and age divides?'b''b'Dr. Otis W. Brawley,'b' the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that the new study pointed to inequity of access and good treatment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen we look at the difference between black and white, and rich and poor, we find the same disparity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe quality of assessment and follow-up treatment can be different. The question becomes: how do we get adequate preventive care to all people?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although this study looked at the divide between black and white women, Dr. Schmeler said that it implicitly raised alarms for other poor women of color. Along border towns in Texas, with an overwhelmingly poor, Hispanic population, she said that 'b'rates of incidence and death from cervical cancer'b' were considerably higher than national figures.'b'Studies such as this latest one consider death rates from a broad epidemiological perspective; statistically, its grimmest news is about older black women. But on the ground, 'b'Dr. M. Margaret Kemeny'b', the director of the Queens Cancer Center of Queens Hospital, a public institution in New York, said she had treated many younger women of color with a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Although the disease is preventable and, if detected early, treatable, Dr. Kemeny\xe2\x80\x99s patients have often never had Pap smears.'b'She recently had to perform total pelvic exenterations on two women, each with recurring cervical cancer, one Chinese, the other Hispanic. She removed the cervix, vagina, rectum and bladder, inserting two ostomy bags, which are worn outside the body to collect urine and stool. \xe2\x80\x9cOne was 39,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Kemeny said, \xe2\x80\x9cand the other was 25.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'President Trump last month 'b'signed an executive order'b' barring American aid to international organizations that discuss 'b'abortion'b' as a family-planning option with clients. American law already forbids the use of taxpayer money to fund the procedure itself.'b'In Europe, the president\xe2\x80\x99s order brought an unexpected response. Lilianne Ploumen, 54, minister of foreign trade and development cooperation in the Netherlands, established a nongovernmental organization, 'b'She Decides'b', to raise money for aid groups whose funding is threatened under the new order.'b'The Dutch ministry announced a donation of 10 million euros to She Decides, and Belgium and Denmark followed with matching grants. In March, representatives of 19 governments will convene in Brussels to see what else they can do to make up for the shortfall in American funding.'b'I spoke with Ms. Ploumen by Skype last week. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity and space.'b''b'Q. What was your 'b''b' reaction when you heard about 'b''b'President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s order? 'b''b''b'A.'b' Well, of course, I was very disappointed and a little bit shocked because, you know, this is 2017. You would have expected that in 2017 the rights of women and girls to be the masters of their own bodies and their own sexual lives would be something matter-of-fact.'b''b'Did you think, \xe2\x80\x9c'b''b'W'b''b'hat can I do to counter this?\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Yes. And if you\xe2\x80\x99re a minister of foreign trade and development cooperation, one of the good things is that you 'b'can 'b'do something. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I came up with this idea of creating this fund.'b'I talked to my staff about it. They were a little cautious at first. They thought we should do this with other countries and start negotiating with the others. I thought if you start the long process of negotiating, you don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happens before we get to a result.'b'I said, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s take the initiative and if others follow, yes! If others don\xe2\x80\x99t, we\xe2\x80\x99ll still have done the right thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'What was the response when you reached out to your counterparts in other countries?'b''b'Most thought it was an amazing initiative and were pleased. I have to say that my Belgium counterpart, Alexander De Croo, he was the most swift of all. He immediately said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to help \xe2\x80\x94 not only to donate money, but we\xe2\x80\x99re going to organize and host this conference.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By then, we\xe2\x80\x99d had an overwhelming response. For a couple of days, She Decides was my 24-hour task, which was great but I really needed help. The Swedes, the Danes, the Finns, Luxembourg, Canada \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99ve all been supportive. Cape Verde said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will support this,\xe2\x80\x9d which is really great because this is not only about, you know, the Nordics. We want this to be global.'b''b'When you reached out to counterparts in other countries'b''b', did any turn you down?'b''b'Well, some said, \xe2\x80\x9cWe support the cause, but we also want to be sensitive to our relations with the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s up to every country, of course, to make their decision. We have nine so far who support the initiative and will speak out for it. There are some 19 countries now interested in attending the March 2 meeting.'b'There are countries that want to talk about reproductive health but are a little hesitant about \xe2\x80\x9creproductive rights.\xe2\x80\x9d And there are countries that feel that \xe2\x80\x9cpro-choice\xe2\x80\x9d might be difficult for their own public. Some of them need more time, though we hope they will join us in Brussels.'b''b'How much have you raised so far?'b''b'I think we have 30 million euros from the Netherlands, Denmark and Belgium. That\xe2\x80\x99s great, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not enough.'b'At the Brussels meeting we will ask for more commitments. There\xe2\x80\x99s also a crowdfunding platform where citizens can contribute. We are talking to the private sector, to N.G.O.s, to gain stronger support.'b'Many Americans have called and said, \xe2\x80\x9cHow can we contribute?\xe2\x80\x9d The thing is we want to make sure that this becomes something that stays. Probably around $600 million a year will have to be raised to make up for what is being lost through the gag rule.'b''b'There are researchers who say that when the r'b''b'ule was in place previously, it had the unintended effect of increasing the abortion rate in parts of the developing world. If that\xe2\x80\x99s accurate, could it happen again?'b''b'Yeah, definitely. Because the organizations that will lose funds deliver a very broad range of services: mother and child medical care, contraceptives, sexual education for young people. If people cannot get low-cost 'b'condoms'b' or any information on how to protect themselves, this might lead to pregnancies that people really didn\xe2\x80\x99t plan for.'b'And that, in turn, might make some people ask for an abortion, which of course in many countries is not done under very safe conditions. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we support broad services.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t think anyone has an abortion because she wants to. There\xe2\x80\x99s always a reason she makes that decision. But if you have access to sex education and to 'b'birth control'b', then you often don\xe2\x80\x99t have to have an abortion.'b'I just heard from a woman who works in our embassy in Senegal. She got word from her mother and sister who live in a remote village. They told her, \xe2\x80\x9cThis cannot be. It will mean that women will get pregnant again without wanting to be. It will mean that our girls won\xe2\x80\x99t get sex education as they have for the past five years. It will change our community.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Have you personally witnessed the impact of these types of services in the developing world?'b''b'I was in Brazil a few years ago. Abortion is legal only if the 'b'pregnancy'b' puts the life of the mother in danger or is the result of a rape. There isn\xe2\x80\x99t choice. And so there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of illegal abortion.'b'For the women, the experience is traumatic. First, there is the shock of an unplanned pregnancy, and then you have find someone in a back alley in often very unsafe conditions.'b'One has to say, though, that Brazil is a very strong supporter of women\xe2\x80\x99s rights. But it is a very Catholic country. We hope that Brazilian women will continue to have access to services for medical reasons. By the way, I am a Catholic myself.'b''b'Really?'b''b'Yes. Some people think that when you\xe2\x80\x99re Catholic, you just do as you\xe2\x80\x99re told. But being Catholic is basically about forming your own conscience within certain rules and regulations. My mom always taught me that your own conscience is your basic frame of reference.'b''b'There\xe2\x80\x99'b''b's an election scheduled in the Netherlands in 'b''b'late March. In advance polling, a right-wing populist 'b''b' appears to be making a strong showing. What happens to 'b''b'She Decides'b''b' if he wins?'b''b'Well, listen, we always have coalition governments. And that means that whoever is in those governments will need to compromise. I\xe2\x80\x99m a Social Democrat, and I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that we will have a good result in the elections.'b'This 10 million euros goes to She Decides whoever will be in government. We know that it is such a strong movement in the Netherlands that regardless of any party, it will continue.'
