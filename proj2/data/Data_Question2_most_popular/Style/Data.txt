Often our mirth seems fueled by some deep-celled delight at being together. Friendship, like its flashier cousin, love, can be wildly chemical and, like love, can happen in an instant.'b'When I met Austin, I was in my early 40s and not looking for a friend. I had come alone to this small Oregon town to finish a book. So when a bony, blue-eyed stranger knocked on my door, introducing herself as the lady from across the way and wondering if I might like to come over and see her garden \xe2\x80\x94 maybe have a gin and tonic \xe2\x80\x94 I politely declined.'b'Watching her walk away, though, in her velvet slip-ons and wrinkled blouse, I felt a strange pang, a slow pin of sadness that I suppose could best be described as loneliness. Suddenly I was dashing into the dirt road to say that I was sorry, that she had caught me in the middle of work, but that, yes, I would enjoy seeing her garden.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot the gin and tonic?\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSure, that too,\xe2\x80\x9d I answered, blushing. And before I could suggest a visit the next week, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99ll see you in a few hours, then. Shall we say 4:30?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I had to admire her sense of time. Next week is for someone who can afford to put things off. Austin, in her 80s, surely felt no such luxury.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI liked your face,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted later, telling me she had spotted me at the mailbox.'b'As she poured the gin, I told her I had seen her at the mailbox, as well, and liked her face, too.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I had better eyebrows,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey used to be fabulous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Her garden was astounding, like something dreamed rather than planted, a mad-hatter gothic in which a lawless grace prevailed.'b'At dusk, the deer arrived, nibbling the crab apple blossoms. We had been talking for hours, slightly tipsy, and then we were in the kitchen cooking dinner. A retired psychologist, Austin had traveled extensively, spoke terrible Spanish and worse French, and was a painter now. She had had two husbands, the second of whom died in this house, in a small bed in the living room.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I\xe2\x80\x99ll do,\xe2\x80\x9d Austin told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThis room gets the best light.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'We turned to the windows, but the light was already gone. That we could be quiet together so soon, and without strain, felt auspicious.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo you\xe2\x80\x99ve run away from home?\xe2\x80\x9d she said at one point.'b'From the beginning, there was something about our interaction that reminded me of friendships from childhood, in which no question was off limits. On religion, she claimed to be an atheist. I admitted to being haunted by the ghosts of a Roman Catholic upbringing. She said her sisters believed in hell and worried about her soul. Austin, though, seemed afraid of nothing, least of all death. I said I was still afraid of the dark.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving alone,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can make you funny.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I laughed but changed the subject, telling her I would like to see her paintings.'b'Later, crossing the road back to my Craigslist sublet, I wondered what I was doing. I reminded myself of my plan: hiding out, staying in the dream of the book. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here to socialize. After years of work on a single project, I was in the final stretch. I could finish a draft in a few months and head back home.'b'Besides, if I wanted a friend during my retreat, I would find someone my age to throw back beers with. Gin and tonics with an old lady in her garden? That wasn\xe2\x80\x99t in the plan.'b'But there I was the next weekend having dinner with her, and then it was every weekend. Sometimes we went out to a restaurant or hiked in the mountains. Austin\xe2\x80\x99s older friends seemed confused.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs he helping you with the computer?\xe2\x80\x9d one asked.'b'When I first started talking about Austin to my own out-of-town friends, they assumed I had found a new boyfriend.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAustin\xe2\x80\x99s a woman,\xe2\x80\x9d I would say. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, she\xe2\x80\x99s in her 80s. She\xe2\x80\x99s just a pal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even as they replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s cool,\xe2\x80\x9d I could almost hear them thinking: \xe2\x80\x9cMust be slim pickings out in Oregon.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What was perplexing, I suppose, was not that two people of such different ages had become friends, but that we had essentially become best friends. Others regarded our devotion as either strange or quaint, like one of those unlikely animal friendships: a monkey and a pigeon, perhaps.'b'Admittedly, when I would spot us in a mirror, I saw how peculiar we were. This vivacious white-haired imp in her bright colors and chunk-style jewelry sitting with the dark-haired man in his drab earth-tone sweaters and Clark Kent glasses. Maybe I looked like some nerdy gigolo or this elegant woman\xe2\x80\x99s attentive secretary. If we made no sense from the outside, it didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter. We were mostly looking at each other.'b'One night, Austin chatted about her life as a middle-aged wife in academia. \xe2\x80\x9cI completely missed out on the wildness of the \xe2\x80\x9960s,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'I told her I had missed out, too.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou weren\xe2\x80\x99t born yet,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOr hardly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Often we cooked together, as we had that first night, after which she would show me whatever painting she was working on. At her request, I also started reading to her from my book-in-progress. We gave each other feedback; our work improved.'b'When my six-month lease was up, I renewed it. The novel wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finished. Plus, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine a better neighbor.'b'Before I knew it, three years had passed. I was writing seven days a week and spending most evenings with Austin. Sometimes she had spells of vertigo now, and when we walked together she held my arm. Often she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find the right word for something. When she wanted to keep away visitors so she could paint, she hung a sign on her studio door: \xe2\x80\x9cDo not destroy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Soon the headaches came, and more jumbled language. \xe2\x80\x9cI need to screw my calls,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, meaning she needed to screen them.'b'We laughed, then sobered. Tests were scheduled.'b'Now she is eight months into what the doctors say is a quick-ravaging illness deep in her brain. They say there is no stopping it. A year more, if she\xe2\x80\x99s lucky. Even as I refuse to believe this, I prepare for it.'b'How? By keeping my promise to her.'b'A few months before her diagnosis, Austin had attended a wedding. She showed me a copy of the vows, which had been distributed at the ceremony \xe2\x80\x94 a detailed list. I read it carefully, at Austin\xe2\x80\x99s bidding. We were sitting in a car, waiting for our favorite Thai restaurant to open.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never had anything like that with the men in my life,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, pointing to the vows. \xe2\x80\x9cWe loved each other, but we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have that.\xe2\x80\x9d She was crying now, something she rarely did.'b'I took her hand and said, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, you have it with me. Everything but the sex.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At which point, the monkey kissed the pigeon.'b'That night, I had an odd realization: Some of the greatest romances of my life have been friendships. And these friendships have been, in many ways, more mysterious than erotic love: more subtle, less selfish, more attuned to kindness.'b'Of course, Austin was going to die long before I did. That\xe2\x80\x99s not what this is about. This, I have come to understand, is a love story.'b'Austin continued to paint for several months more, fractured, psychedelic self-portraits in scorching colors. Her best work. Lately, though, she is tired and hardly leaves the couch. I sit with her, at the opposite end, our legs intertwined.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRead to me,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.'b'When I tell her the book is finished, she tells me to read her something new. But whenever I do, she promptly falls asleep.'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t leave, though. I stare out the window. Austin was right. This room does get the best light.'b'Recently her hair has thinned, but she has a shock of white up front that a friend\xe2\x80\x99s daughter has dyed with a streak of fuchsia. She looks like some punk girl I might have dated in high school.'b'She had a bit more energy the last time I came to visit and said: \xe2\x80\x9cOh, Victor, I had the most wonderful dessert yesterday. Peaches and Connecticut. Have you ever had it?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, smiling.'b'I loved the idea of it. Two things that don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to go together.

If so, how do you choose someone?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He was a university acquaintance I occasionally ran into at the climbing gym and had thought, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if?\xe2\x80\x9d I had gotten a glimpse into his days on Instagram. But this was the first time we had hung out one-on-one.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cActually, psychologists have tried making people fall in love,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, remembering 'b'Dr. Aron\xe2\x80\x99s study'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fascinating. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always wanted to try it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I first read about the study when I was in the midst of a breakup. Each time I thought of leaving, my heart overruled my brain. I felt stuck. So, like a good academic, I turned to science, hoping there was a way to love smarter.'b'I explained the study to my university acquaintance. A heterosexual man and woman enter the lab through separate doors. They sit face to face and answer a series of increasingly personal questions. Then they stare silently into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for four minutes. The most tantalizing detail: Six months later, two participants were married. They invited the entire lab to the ceremony.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s try it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Let me acknowledge the ways our experiment already fails to line up with the study. First, we were in a bar, not a lab. Second, we weren\xe2\x80\x99t strangers. Not only that, but I see now that one neither suggests nor agrees to try an experiment designed to create romantic love if one isn\xe2\x80\x99t open to this happening.'b'I Googled Dr. Aron\xe2\x80\x99s questions; 'b'there are 36'b'. We spent the next two hours passing my iPhone across the table, alternately posing each question.'b'They began innocuously: \xe2\x80\x9cWould you like to be famous? In what way?\xe2\x80\x9d And \xe2\x80\x9cWhen did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But they quickly became probing.'b'In response to the prompt, \xe2\x80\x9cName three things you and your partner appear to have in common,\xe2\x80\x9d he looked at me and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re both interested in each other.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I grinned and gulped my beer as he listed two more commonalities I then promptly forgot. We exchanged stories about the last time we each cried, and confessed the one thing we\xe2\x80\x99d like to ask a fortuneteller. We explained our relationships with our mothers.'b'The questions reminded me of the infamous boiling frog experiment in which the frog doesn\xe2\x80\x99t feel the water getting hotter until it\xe2\x80\x99s too late. With us, because the level of vulnerability increased gradually, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice we had entered intimate territory until we were already there, a process that can typically take weeks or months.'b'I liked learning about myself through my answers, but I liked learning things about him even more. The bar, which was empty when we arrived, had filled up by the time we paused for a bathroom break.'b'I sat alone at our table, aware of my surroundings for the first time in an hour, and wondered if anyone had been listening to our conversation. If they had, I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t noticed. And I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice as the crowd thinned and the night got late.'b'We all have a narrative of ourselves that we offer up to strangers and acquaintances, but Dr. Aron\xe2\x80\x99s questions make it impossible to rely on that narrative. Ours was the kind of accelerated intimacy I remembered from summer camp, staying up all night with a new friend, exchanging the details of our short lives. At 13, away from home for the first time, it felt natural to get to know someone quickly. But rarely does adult life present us with such circumstances.'b'The moments I found most uncomfortable were not when I had to make confessions about myself, but had to venture opinions about my partner. For example: \xe2\x80\x9cAlternate sharing something you consider a positive characteristic of your partner, a total of five items\xe2\x80\x9d (Question 22), and \xe2\x80\x9cTell your partner what you like about them; be very honest this time saying things you might not say to someone you\xe2\x80\x99ve just met\xe2\x80\x9d (Question 28).'b'Much of Dr. Aron\xe2\x80\x99s research focuses on creating interpersonal closeness. In particular, several studies investigate the ways we incorporate others into our sense of self. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to see how the questions encourage what they call \xe2\x80\x9cself-expansion.\xe2\x80\x9d Saying things like, \xe2\x80\x9cI like your voice, your taste in beer, the way all your friends seem to admire you,\xe2\x80\x9d makes certain positive qualities belonging to one person explicitly valuable to the other.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s astounding, really, to hear what someone admires in you. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why we don\xe2\x80\x99t go around thoughtfully complimenting one another all the time.'b'We finished at midnight, taking far longer than the 90 minutes for the original study. Looking around the bar, I felt as if I had just woken up. \xe2\x80\x9cThat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so bad,\xe2\x80\x9d I said. \xe2\x80\x9cDefinitely less uncomfortable than the staring into each other\xe2\x80\x99s eyes part would be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He hesitated and asked. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think we should do that, too?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere?\xe2\x80\x9d I looked around the bar. It seemed too weird, too public.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe could stand on the bridge,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, turning toward the window.'b'The night was warm and I was wide-awake. We walked to the highest point, then turned to face each other. I fumbled with my phone as I set the timer.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K.,\xe2\x80\x9d I said, inhaling sharply.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K.,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, smiling.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve skied steep slopes and hung from a rock face by a short length of rope, but staring into someone\xe2\x80\x99s eyes for four silent minutes was one of the more thrilling and terrifying experiences of my life. I spent the first couple of minutes just trying to breathe properly. There was a lot of nervous smiling until, eventually, we settled in.'b'I know the eyes are the windows to the soul or whatever, but the real crux of the moment was not just that I was really seeing someone, but that I was seeing someone really seeing me. Once I embraced the terror of this realization and gave it time to subside, I arrived somewhere unexpected.'b'I felt brave, and in a state of wonder. Part of that wonder was at my own vulnerability and part was the weird kind of wonder you get from saying a word over and over until it loses its meaning and becomes what it actually is: an assemblage of sounds.'b'So it was with the eye, which is not a window to anything but rather a clump of very useful cells. The sentiment associated with the eye fell away and I was struck by its astounding biological reality: the spherical nature of the eyeball, the visible musculature of the iris and the smooth wet glass of the cornea. It was strange and exquisite.'b'When the timer buzzed, I was surprised \xe2\x80\x94 and a little relieved. But I also felt a sense of loss. Already I was beginning to see our evening through the surreal and unreliable lens of retrospect.'b'Most of us think about love as something that happens to us. We fall. We get crushed.'b'But what I like about this study is how it assumes that love is an action. It assumes that what matters to my partner matters to me because we have at least three things in common, because we have close relationships with our mothers, and because he let me look at him.'b'I wondered what would come of our interaction. If nothing else, I thought it would make a good story. But I see now that the story isn\xe2\x80\x99t about us; it\xe2\x80\x99s about what it means to bother to know someone, which is really a story about what it means to be known.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s true you can\xe2\x80\x99t choose who loves you, although I\xe2\x80\x99ve spent years hoping otherwise, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t create romantic feelings based on convenience alone. Science tells us biology matters; our pheromones and hormones do a lot of work behind the scenes.'b'But despite all this, I\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to think love is a more pliable thing than we make it out to be. Arthur Aron\xe2\x80\x99s study taught me that it\xe2\x80\x99s possible \xe2\x80\x94 simple, even \xe2\x80\x94 to generate trust and intimacy, the feelings love needs to thrive.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99re probably wondering if he and I fell in love. Well, we did. Although it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to credit the study entirely (it may have happened anyway), the study did give us a way into a relationship that feels deliberate. We spent weeks in the intimate space we created that night, waiting to see what it could become.'b'Love didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to us. We\xe2\x80\x99re in love because we each made the choice to be.'b'The quiet young man had come to me looking for love, ideally at first sight. I asked my usual questions about his work, where he lived, how he spent his free time. I asked about his great loves of the past, what had worked, or not worked, in those relationships. Then I asked how he felt about being jumped on, slobbered on or getting mud all over his couch.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m O.K. with that,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cCan I meet Chance?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ah, Chance. The young lab-mix, with a puppy\xe2\x80\x99s zeal for life, who loved to chew on the shelter volunteers\xe2\x80\x99 hands as we leashed him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBehave yourself for once,\xe2\x80\x9d I urged Chance as I opened the kennel.'b'He was quiet as I slipped on a harness, but when we turned to leave he began to buck wildly. My heart sank. Then I saw the face of the young man waiting by the door. He\xe2\x80\x99d gone all moony. He only had eyes for Chance.'b'Much to my surprise, I have become a matchmaker. On Saturday afternoons I pull on my gray T-shirt and head to the Animal Rescue League of Boston, where I help people find their canine soul mates amid the barky din. Doing this work, I\xe2\x80\x99ve not only learned how to pair up people and canines, I have received a master class in the expansiveness of the human heart, a lesson that I very much needed.'b'Being a matchmaker was never my plan. I began volunteering at the shelter to help dogs. Just dogs. And the more time I spent with the dogs, the more my love for my fellow man withered.'b'At the shelter, I walked dogs that had been abandoned for trivial reasons or for no reason at all. I cared for pups that had been tied to utility poles on the street in wintertime, others so thin they had to wear coats in balmy spring weather, lacking the body mass to stay warm at 60 degrees. The more I walked these dogs, the more I became an animal person.'b'To be called an animal person is not necessarily a compliment, not when it implies that you love animals with a passion matched only by how much you loathe your own species. Animal people can be judgmental, self-righteous and cranky, all of which I was becoming.'b'As I spent more time at the shelter, I found that I became less patient with human beings, even my sweet husband. Walking the dogs would cheer me up, but my mood would darken as I fixated on the stupidity and carelessness of my fellow Homo sapiens. On the subway ride home I often caught myself frowning at strangers on the train.'b'Then I realized that if I truly wanted to help the dogs, I needed to do more than exercise or comfort them. I had to help them get out of the shelter faster, before kennel life turned them into whirling dervishes that no one would adopt. So I asked to be trained to introduce dogs to their potential adopters.'b'In the early going, helping with adoptions made my dismal opinion of people worse: I had to answer too many silly questions (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are those droopy things on her belly?\xe2\x80\x9d) and field nonsensical requests (\xe2\x80\x9cI want a dog I can crate 12 hours a day, but who will run with me on weekends.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Then one Saturday afternoon I noticed a young, outdoorsy couple walking down the row of kennels, stopping to say hello to each dog. I asked if they wanted to meet one.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCan we meet Ciera?\xe2\x80\x9d the man asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCiera?\xe2\x80\x9d I squeaked. \xe2\x80\x9cReally? I mean yes, of course you can.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No one ever asked to see Ciera, a young mutt with skinny legs that went this way and that. Shiny and black, like a seal, she was cute but regularly pooped right in her kennel, then ran back and forth in it. She thought it was fun to grab your arm with her small mouth, hard, or if you dared sit on the floor, pounce on your head. She zoomed around her kennel as if on amphetamines.'b'This was her big chance. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to mislead this couple about what a nut she was, but I did want her to find a home. I asked them to follow me to a bare-bones room with a stained rug and couch.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t we stand?\xe2\x80\x9d I suggested.'b'As I began reading the notes on Ciera out loud, I dropped her leash and hoped for the best. She began ricocheting around the room, bouncing off the couch, the bookcases and the man\xe2\x80\x99s legs as her leash snapped behind her. She was an air-bound blur of black, her mouth wide open, joy in her eyes. On one pass, she ripped my clipboard out of my hand and kept running.'b'As I muffled a sigh, the couple laughed. Hard. I looked up. Their faces glowed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love her,\xe2\x80\x9d the man said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMe too,\xe2\x80\x9d said the woman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Everyone knows that dogs can be firehose-like gushers of unqualified love. Humans, in contrast, have always struck me more as takers than givers, fickle lovers who are cagey with their affections and hearts. But in watching people tumble for goofballs like Ciera, I saw that my own species longs, maybe even needs, to gush unqualified love too, something we rarely do with other humans, even with a mate.'b'A dog may eat our Italian loafers but will never ghost us, or say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to have a talk.\xe2\x80\x9d With them, we can let it all hang out. At the shelter, that\xe2\x80\x99s what people did with our one-eyed pugs, our ancient hounds with bald patches and juveniles who hopped like kangaroos.'b'Watching people fall in love so completely with dogs, I began to see how humans long to give their hearts away.'b'Of course, there are outliers: cool customers set on French bulldogs of a certain shade, or people who turn up their noses at pit bulls, even the smoosh-mouthed little \xe2\x80\x9cpittie puppies.\xe2\x80\x9d And the difficulties of human relationships can keep the love from flowing.'b'I spent one afternoon introducing one small dog after another to a doughy man and his wife. As the man sighed happily at each pooch, his wife ran her hand over the dog\xe2\x80\x99s coat, then sniffed her manicured fingers to check on her allergies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot him. He\xe2\x80\x99s making me sniffle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By the end of the afternoon, the man was sitting in the lobby with his head in his hands while his wife dug her fingers into a tangle of white fur named William.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re breaking my heart,\xe2\x80\x9d he moaned.'b'I wanted to tell him to take William and leave the wife behind.'b'But most of us are like the middle-aged couple who came in looking for a mellow, pint-size dog to fit in their one-bedroom, beachside apartment. We had no miniatures that day, but on a long shot I pointed the men to a good-natured shepherd mix with a coat like a shag rug, about the size of a motorcycle.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe might take up half the couch,\xe2\x80\x9d I told them, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he\xe2\x80\x99ll happily lounge all day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s gigantic!\xe2\x80\x9d one exclaimed, smiling.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe should go,\xe2\x80\x9d the other said.'b'For the next hour, each time I walked in and out of the kennels, there stood the couple, beaming at the behemoth. Watching them fall for the fuzzy giant \xe2\x80\x94 a dog completely at odds with what they claimed to want \xe2\x80\x94 I felt the remaining coldness in my heart for my species begin to thaw.'b'I wanted to help them. I wanted to help people do what they so obviously needed to do: love wholeheartedly, with reckless abandon. I had always thought of love as a response, but this couple and others showed me that it\xe2\x80\x99s an innate feeling, something we are born with, and need to express.'b'Many of us have more love inside than we know what to do with, but are too bottled up. Which is where dogs can come in. With them, we can let our love flow freely without fear of being judged or rejected. They are like safety valves.'b'They certainly had become that for me. But as I saw the couple making kissy noises to the shepherd through his kennel door, I realized I had relied on dogs for this to a fault. With humans, I had bottled myself up. And love doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to be bottled up. That\xe2\x80\x99s how you end up frowning at strangers on the train.'b'Watching people fall in love is contagious. I began to swoon at the whole scene. I loved the dog. I loved the couple.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K., time you all met,\xe2\x80\x9d I announced, grabbing a leash.'b'Soon after, the three of them went home together, to try to squeeze into their cozy apartment. I returned to the kennels to help more people toss their hearts away.'b''b''b'Announcing our 4th Modern Love College Essay Contest. See 'b'nytimes.com/essaycontest'b' for details.'b''b''b'MEXICO CITY \xe2\x80\x94 As bad hombre tales go, Eduardo Garc\xc3\xada\xe2\x80\x99s is classic. A border-crossing Mexican immigrant, he moved around the United States through the better part a decade, harvesting the produce that most of us take for granted throughout what might be thought of as a stolen childhood. Starting at age 5, the unschooled Mr. Garc\xc3\xada embarked on a journey that drew on native intelligence, natural gift and a willingness to take on backbreaking work to make something of himself \xe2\x80\x94 in his case, a chef.'b'Like many of the immigrants keeping American farming alive and restaurant kitchens humming, his true citizenship was in a shadow economy. And like so many young men with more ambition than sense, he made mistakes that would send him first to jail and eventually home as a deportee to a country he knew less well than the one in which he was raised.'b'As fate would have it, it was at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Mexico and later at an establishment of his own that Mr. Garc\xc3\xada transformed himself into a superstar of a thriving food scene. In less than a decade at the celebrated Pujol and later at M\xc3\xa1ximo Bistrot, the restaurant he operates with his wife, Gabriela, in a corner of the Colonia Roma section of this thronging capital, Mr. Garc\xc3\xada has garnered awards and plaudits for the bright clarity of the flavors his kitchen conjures and the subtly layered elegance of his efforts fusing classic French technique with traditional Mexican preparations and ingredients.'b'On a recent springlike morning before M\xc3\xa1ximo Bistrot opened for lunch, Mr. Garc\xc3\xada, known as Lalo, sat with a reporter to talk about his complicated journey from there to here:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe started M\xc3\xa1ximo Bistrot in 2011 with four employees. The idea was to keep things small. But then I noticed, after a while, that employees were building homes. A lot of them were Mexicans who had migrated to the United States and then sent money back home to construct houses. With the wages we paid, they could stay in Mexico and earn enough to have a good life. So we decided finally it was a good idea to grow the business and employ as many people as possible, because in Mexico a lot of people\xe2\x80\x99s pockets get bigger and bigger, but never the little guy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe now have three restaurants in the city, M\xc3\xa1ximo Bistrot, Lalo! and Havre 77. Over all, the cuisine is French-Mexican. We also have 130 employees with six partnerships in Mexico, two in London and one in Dubai.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe thing is, I\xe2\x80\x99m not ashamed to say it, but I\xe2\x80\x99m a convicted felon in the United States: deported two times, in 2000 and 2007. My entire family still lives there and I love the country \xe2\x80\x94 it gave me everything I have \xe2\x80\x94 but I\xe2\x80\x99m banned from going there now.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy family was all migrant workers, and I grew up in the fields. I started at the age of 5. I never went to school. My parents were illiterate and I\xe2\x80\x99m illiterate, too. I can read and write a little, but my grammar is horrible.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the beginning of the season, in the fall, we used to pick oranges, lemons, limes and grapefruit in Florida. Then we would go to Georgia to plant Vidalia onions. From there we moved on to Michigan to pick apples, blueberries and plums. After that, it was Pennsylvania to pick mushrooms at night: Mushrooms only come out at night. Then we\xe2\x80\x99d go to Ohio to pick cucumbers for pickling and back to Georgia to harvest the onions we\xe2\x80\x99d planted. I still have scars from picking on all the fingers of both hands.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI stopped that work when I turned 14. We\xe2\x80\x99d been going up and going down the country and always through Atlanta until one year, in 1991, we stopped to visit an aunt there and my father found a job at a country club cutting grass. So we decided to stay for a while. I got a job washing dishes at the Georgia Grille on Peachtree Road. Hard physical work has always been my life. My cooks in the kitchen here at M\xc3\xa1ximo Bistrot are a little afraid of me, I think. When I arrive in the early morning, they panic. They always think they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done enough because I\xe2\x80\x99m here 18 hours a day every day.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWithin six months of getting that dishwasher job, I was promoted to the salad station. I worked in those days with illegal documents. I had a 'b'Social Security'b' number, but it was a fake because I was actually too young to work legally.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA guy above me at the Georgia Grille was from Puerto Rico. He watched how I learned and he said, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re very talented.\xe2\x80\x99 Whatever task anybody gave me, I picked it up right away. My father had always taught me to be better than anyone else, so already, by the age of 10, I was making the same money as an adult.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you pick tomatoes, you pick from 7 to 11 in the morning and that\xe2\x80\x99s it. After that, the sun is too hot and you don\xe2\x80\x99t mess with the plants. For every bucket you turn in, you get a chip to redeem for cash. It could be 50 cents and it could be $1, depending on how good the crop was. Even as a kid, I was really into getting more chips than anyone. It was my version of a video game.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Puerto Rican guy went on to work as a butcher in Brasserie Le Coze, a restaurant Eric Ripert [the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin] was opening. He said I should try for a job there. After months of yes, no, yes, I got hired and it was the best job I ever had. They promoted me pretty quickly to garde-manger and suddenly I was making, like, 200 to 300 salads or terrines or duck confit, and it was like, \xe2\x80\x98Wow, this is stuff I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even know existed.\xe2\x80\x99'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy vocation and my work really began in the United States, which is why I love it just as much as I love Mexico. I even loved working in the fields, though my father died of gastrointestinal cancer that most likely came from being around so many pesticides. In the Mexican generation my father was from, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want us to follow his path. When I was little, he looked at us and said, \xe2\x80\x98This is not good, little kids working like adults.\xe2\x80\x99 But, unfortunately, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to educate us, so I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold him to blame.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPretty soon I was promoted again to chef de partie. I was making more than my father, whose life had been so hard, working so many years in the sun that he looked like 60 at 45. Even so, for me it was never about, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m going to become a chef.\xe2\x80\x99 It was none of that. I was just working at something I loved.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI always say the best and worst thing for us Mexicans was Nafta. We became literally accustomed to American ways. We forgot how to be Mexican. Now that is changing. Ten or 15 years ago, a Mexican would never tell you he had his ancestors\xe2\x80\x99 indigenous blood in his body. Now, because of regionalism in food and music and art, everybody suddenly has a grandmother in Oaxaca. Sometimes, still, we\xe2\x80\x99re ashamed we\xe2\x80\x99re from Mexico.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wanted eventually to become a sous chef, so I took another kitchen job, which paid $29,000 a year, as a cook at a restaurant in Alpharetta, Ga. My father was very ill and I needed the money. It was there that I began to wonder, \xe2\x80\x98How else do I learn to be a real chef?\xe2\x80\x99 And that was when I really began to think about cooking seriously, constantly studying Charlie Palmer or Charlie Trotter and what they were doing. I studied and I mimicked what they had done and realized that most cookbooks are not ever accurate. So then I started to experiment. My training for this life is different from chefs who went to culinary schools. My entire education took place in kitchens.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter six months, the owners of that restaurant said, \xe2\x80\x98Now we can make you a sous chef.\xe2\x80\x99 Unfortunately for me, as well as I was doing, I met some bad hombres along the way. My life started to go sideways. I began to sell drugs for the dishwashers. I never want to run from this, but it is true that all through my working life I had always given my father any money I made; he was my bank. Suddenly I realized then that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to ask him for money. I could just make money on the side.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never got caught selling drugs, and to this day I can say I never tasted what I was selling. But what got me in trouble was when a cousin of mine asked me to drive him and a friend to a liquor store they were going to rob. I knew this. It was a moment in life. We got away, but I told myself I needed to face the consequences, so I turned myself in. I was charged with aggravated assault, convicted and spent one year in county jail and three years in maximum security prison in South Georgia. Immigration put a hold on me and transferred me to one of the hardest jails in the system, where I spent three years making auto tags. Then, at the end of 2000, I came to Mexico, deported for the first time.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was only back in Mexico for two weeks when my mother called and gave me the news that my father was dying of cancer. It was a big risk, but I had to take a chance to try to see him in the United States before he died. So I bought fake Social Security documents and crossed a bridge at Nuevo Laredo like everybody else. I had a feeling in me that it would be all right. My father didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to have an operation or chemo, so they told him he would live two weeks. In fact, he lived another six years and every one of those years that I stayed I felt I didn\xe2\x80\x99t belong in the States. I had spent a lot of time in kitchens by then and applied for a job as a chef. I kind of told a lie in telling people I already was one.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne day in 2007, immigration went to the restaurant and talked to the manager, who came to me crying and said, \xe2\x80\x98They\xe2\x80\x99re here for you.\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry, I knew this day was going to come.\xe2\x80\x99 I was arrested again and spent four months in federal prison in South Georgia. I swore then I would never ever see the inside of a jail cell again. I was deported again and I really didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what was next for me.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t hide from any of this, because I want people around me to know who I am. A lot of people have been through what I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through. Yes, it is shameful to say, you\xe2\x80\x99re a fraud, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been deported, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been in prison. But these are mistakes any human being can make. Reading about the deportations \xe2\x80\x94 the poor guy in Tijuana who just jumped off a bridge \xe2\x80\x94 I want to encourage Mexicans who are in the same situation to know they\xe2\x80\x99ll be welcome to come back and be in their own country.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom 2007 to 2011, I worked as chef de cuisine at Pujol, and then at the end of 2010, the beginning of 2011, with a loan from an uncle of mine, I opened M\xc3\xa1ximo Bistrot. The dream by then was not to become a well-known chef. It was to become a good chef. And, well, here we are.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cat Marnell, once a young beauty editor at the now-closed Lucky magazine, is known for her drug use and for writing about her drug use \xe2\x80\x94 at first for 'b'xoJane'b', the online magazine headed by Jane Pratt, and when she flamed out there, at Vice, in a short-lived column called \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Amphetamine Logic'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d Her devoted and horrified readers thrilled to the descriptions of her benders \xe2\x80\x94 on heroin, PCP, crack cocaine, regular cocaine, Adderall and alcohol, among a medley of other narcotics and stimulants \xe2\x80\x94 delivered in a volley of capital letters and exclamation points, and larded with the names of beauty products, fashion brands and celebrities. Her arch prose style recalled the anomie of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Andy Warhol Diaries,\xe2\x80\x9d the deadpan exposition of \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Psycho\xe2\x80\x9d and the girl-speak pioneered by the staff of Sassy, the teenage magazine edited by Ms. Pratt that was published from 1988 to 1996.'b'Ms. Marnell turned the tropes of women\xe2\x80\x99s magazine writing upside down, with stories like \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Art of Crack-tractiveness: How to Look and Feel Hot on No Sleep'b',\xe2\x80\x9d which offered tips like \xe2\x80\x9cBrush your teeth!\xe2\x80\x9d along with a how-to guide to real beauty products for fellow partyers who might, like Ms. Marnell, have spent the night in a warehouse, as she wrote, with a \xe2\x80\x9cbunch of U.K. dustheads for five straight hours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was irresistible, and also appalling, and the internet tied itself up in knots debating Ms. Marnell\xe2\x80\x99s honesty, talent, authenticity and narcissism, along with the exploitative and enabling behavior of her many bosses. Naturally, she got a book deal and a half-million dollar advance from Simon &amp; Schuster. That she was able to produce her addiction memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Murder Your Life,\xe2\x80\x9d out this week, is a startling feat, given her history of cycling through rehab and psych wards, and her continued prescription drug use. The book is as compelling \xe2\x80\x94 and as problematic \xe2\x80\x94 as her magazine writing: vivid, maddening, heartbreaking, very funny, chaotic and repetitive, as benders are.'b'On a recent Tuesday, Ms. Marnell, now 34, welcomed me into her Chinatown apartment, a one-bedroom overlooking the on-ramp to the Manhattan Bridge. The place, which she rented a year and a half ago, was decorated with stacks of addiction memoirs; a sheepskin rug upon which was laid a strand of blue Christmas lights aglow; a gray wool sofa; a few framed Takashi Murakami prints; and a poster of Harry Styles of the pop boy band One Direction.'b'Birdlike and delicate-looking, Ms. Marnell wore bell-bottom jeans, a pink tank top and a waist-length wig in candy colors, one of a sizable collection she has amassed since her hair fell out a few years ago, she isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite sure why. She ordered three cups of coffee from a nearby deli, smoked a Marlboro Light very quickly, blowing the smoke out of the sliding glass windows that open to a fire escape, and then poured herself a glass of white wine.'b'The following interview has been edited and condensed.'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve just finished reading your book, which is harrowing, so I\xe2\x80\x99m a little shaken.'b''b'Dude, that was four years ago. I have everything now but hair, though I\xe2\x80\x99m not in recovery and I\xe2\x80\x99m not clean. People are like, \xe2\x80\x9cIs it so brave to tell everything?\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m like, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d For me, being brave would be being in a program and getting clean, instead of \xe2\x80\x9cI found a way to talk about my problems ad nauseam and somehow get paid for it.\xe2\x80\x9d Not that I want to reduce what I\xe2\x80\x99ve accomplished. I want to say good things.'b''b'One idea about addiction is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a way to impose structure on a chaotic world. Ann Marlowe\xe2\x80\x99s memoir of her heroin addiction, \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Stop Time: Heroin From A to Z,\xe2\x80\x9d out in 2000, is a compelling example. And you still take Adderall and Ambien, right? 'b''b'Yes. That\xe2\x80\x99s really true. People think of addicts as being out of control, and they really are. But I\xe2\x80\x99m also a control freak. I want to control everything with a pill, from my appetite to sleeping.'b''b'Do you feel you\xe2\x80\x99ve been exploited by the magazines you worked for?'b''b'No. Addicts exploit people. I exploited every opportunity. I have my whole life. The thing about addiction, everyone is asking, Don\xe2\x80\x99t you think addiction books are tired? But I think addiction is as human an experience as anything, like heartbreak. It\xe2\x80\x99s like any relationship, a marriage, a divorce, it\xe2\x80\x99s a relationship and it\xe2\x80\x99s human. I wrote this book really for younger people, for the girl I used to be.'b''b'Your father, a psychiatrist, prescribed you Ritalin when you were a teenager.'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s so complicated. The thing is, the A.D.H.D. drugs did help. If you had seen my grades, failing school \xe2\x80\x94 'b'failing!'b' \xe2\x80\x94 and the only thing I had to do was take a pill? That shows the deficit.'b'If my father had been a gun owner, he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have thought twice about having a gun in his office, and I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have touched it or done anything violent. But in the same way, as a doctor, he didn\xe2\x80\x99t think twice about having samples of 'b'Zoloft'b' in his home office. And at 12 years old I did steal samples of antidepressants and bring them to school and take them in front of my friends because I wanted to be cool. I think I am hard-wired for addiction. My father is a good man, and a good dad, and so ethical and I manipulated him for years. But this is the problem. Parents are putting their children on drugs, but they don\xe2\x80\x99t think of them as drugs. They think of them as medication.'b''b'You were good at magazines, even when you were a little girl, making zines up in your bedroom. You write that you always wanted to be a beauty editor. 'b''b'Cond\xc3\xa9 Nast editors were like movie stars to me. When I got to Lucky and saw them in the halls, I wanted to huff Anna Wintour. I would stare at Grace Coddington and her fruity red hair. I wanted to be like them so badly, and I did everything I could to fit in. I want my ashes sprinkled in the Cond\xc3\xa9 Nast library. I have a whole collection of magazines in storage. Italian Vogues. Lucky was on the same floor as the international editions, and I got a lot there.'b'I think about Diana Vreeland, she was so fabulous. Her \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Don\xe2\x80\x99t Yous\xe2\x80\x9d were better than anything on the internet. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been trying to start a list of my own. I just thought of one yesterday: Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you cultivate a wee garden of carnivorous plants so you can lord over them?'b'So magazines were everything to me; it never felt like work. It\xe2\x80\x99s crazy that they are nothing now. I feel so embarrassed having this sleazy book sometimes. Did I just sell out everyone in my life including my parents?'b''b'Let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about your internet reputation. If you Google \xe2\x80\x9cCat Marnell,\xe2\x80\x9d the predominant image is of you in a slip, with smeared lipstick and matted hair and words written in Sharpie on your forearms. Is this the result of a bender or was it your intention to go for a full-on Courtney Love look? 'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve always homaged. Let\xe2\x80\x99s just say it was one night, and it was intentional. It interests me that women paint their face every day. So I was at an event, and I just smeared it.'b''b'On purpose?'b''b'Yes. The reason it\xe2\x80\x99s used over and over is because I never showed up for that many things. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get out of bed. But as a beauty editor who had a drug addiction at the same time, when I got positive attention for that, things just started to meld. Also, I was smoking a lot of PCP.'b'Over the years of writing the book, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be high every day. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be high. I had to take my drugs as prescribed. People still come around wanting to smoke PCP. People don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to change. But I would never go back. The one thing I regret is I had these black silk blackout curtains a friend who works at Helmut Lang gave me. They were thumbtacked over my windows; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have light in my apartment for years. I would go to bed at 9 a.m. I wish I had saved the fabric and made it into a gown and worn it to my book party. That\xe2\x80\x99s a \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Don\xe2\x80\x99t You?!\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy don\xe2\x80\x99t you save your blackout curtains and sew them into a gown?\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b'Your book is dedicated to \xe2\x80\x9call the party girls.\xe2\x80\x9d Can you elaborate? 'b''b'I always wanted to be a party girl. But party girls don\xe2\x80\x99t exist in recovery or rehab. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know until I lost my career that I was an addict and not just a person with problems. Girls come up to me in the nightclubs now, and I see them trotting around in their miniskirts and their flea market rabbit coats and I love them. I was lucky enough to have such strong female mentors, surrogate mother figures like Jean Godfrey-June [Lucky\xe2\x80\x99s beauty director and one of Ms. Marnell\xe2\x80\x99s long-suffering bosses] in roles I forced on them. Now, I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a way to mentor young girls. I don\xe2\x80\x99t work in magazines or have a job. I can\xe2\x80\x99t coach them, but I can talk from an authentic place about what it\xe2\x80\x99s really like to go through this stuff. I\xe2\x80\x99m a privileged person, I\xe2\x80\x99ve never had to struggle, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been through it.'b'I really think the only thing about being younger is that you look good. It\xe2\x80\x99s what they give you to compensate for the fact you\xe2\x80\x99re so unbelievably insecure. I love the girls on the comeup. I love these Instagram models who turn around and get things done. There\xe2\x80\x99s no right way to be a woman. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I feel so protective of the young party girls who are so smart but think it\xe2\x80\x99s all about being sexy and going home with the right guys. All I wanted when I was young was to be cool. Now that I\xe2\x80\x99m cool, I just want to go to Europe. If I were 23, I would have fan-ed out, I would have been obsessed with, 'b'quote-unquote,'b' Cat Marnell.'b'Last year, Fred Klein spent a lot of time in group exercise classes in Manhattan, although replacing his love handles with rock-hard obliques was not his objective. Mr. Klein is the chief content officer for 'b'Peloton Cycle'b', a boutique fitness studio. He was seeking instructors to poach and hire.'b'For months Mr. Klein burned calories but came up empty in his talent search. No instructor had the qualities he was looking for. Then, at a rival studio, Flywheel Sports, he discovered 'b'Alex Toussaint'b'.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFive minutes into the class, I knew it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Klein said in the dazzled tone a Hollywood casting agent might use to recall first meeting Denzel Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cI was, like, he\xe2\x80\x99s a really great Flywheel instructor. But also \xe2\x80\x94 that voice. This guy could do commercial voice-overs. What is he doing locked in a room with only 50 bikes?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The fitness industry has been a cult of personality since the days of 'b'Jack Lalanne'b', and there is no shortage of models and performers within the instructor ranks at places like Equinox and SoulCycle. But perhaps no brand is trying harder to make the connection between working out and glossy entertainment more explicit than Peloton.'b'Peloton started three years ago and has a single location in New York, on West 23rd Street in Chelsea. Riders take classes there, just as they would at any indoor cycling studio. But Peloton\xe2\x80\x99s main source of revenue comes from the black logo-embossed stationary bikes it sells for $2,000 around the country. (The company says it has sold 80,000.)'b'The physical studio, with cameras and lights placed amid the stationary bikes, is really the set where the company films classes, creating sleek videos that can be seen via 'b'live stream or downloaded on-demand'b' by Peloton bike-owners for $39 a month. The instructors are encouraged to break the fourth wall by looking directly into the camera and talking to the at-home riders, whose names and hometowns appear on a computer tablet affixed to their bikes and everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s not think about it as a fitness facility with cameras,\xe2\x80\x9d John Foley, a founder of Peloton and its chief executive, once told his staff. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s think about it as a television streaming facility filming fitness content.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a sense, each class taught is the show, with the 11 instructors as young, beautiful, racially diverse cast members: It\xe2\x80\x99s like \xe2\x80\x9cReal World: Peloton.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is 'b'Ally Love'b', 28, the Afro-sporting model-dancer and Brooklyn Nets host who used fitness to overcome a childhood car accident. There is 'b'Matt Wilpers'b', 33, the aw-shucks Georgia guy who ran Division I college track and might throw a country tune into his ride. The Peloton executives want star power, but not just that. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s also about relatability and authenticity,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Klein said.'b'If the Peloton cast has a leading woman, it\xe2\x80\x99s Robin Arz\xc3\xb3n, 35. She is the studio\xe2\x80\x99s head instructor and the company\xe2\x80\x99s vice president for fitness programming. She has, not incidentally, 86,000 followers on 'b'Instagram'b'.'b'One evening last month, Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n arrived at the studio to lead a 6:30 class. As women and men changed into cycling shoes, Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n swept by them and descended to a small basement dressing room.'b'Sitting before a mirrored vanity like a Broadway actress, she sipped green juice from the gym\xe2\x80\x99s cafe and prepared her workout music. At the sound of a Lil Wayne remix by the D.J. Haterade, Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n jumped up and started energetically dancing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis drop is so sick! I just lose my mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, overcome.'b'A former lawyer, Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n quit office life in 2012 to take a teaching job at a group fitness studio and build a coaching business as RobinNYC. None of that compares with what she is doing now for Peloton. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between standing with a megaphone in Union Square and getting on the soundstage at the \xe2\x80\x98Today\xe2\x80\x99 show,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re up there on the stage, you obviously see the lights and the cameras and think, O.K., this is different,\xe2\x80\x9d she added. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re being counted down by a producer and you simultaneously have nearly 60 people in the room, and at home, 800 people sometimes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n was dressed in a black spandex catsuit with maroon piping that she had worn to teach her afternoon class that day. It was part of her five-piece capsule collection, which she helped design. The catsuit was carried in Peloton\xe2\x80\x99s boutique, before selling out.'b'To not repeat outfits, she changed for her evening class into orange leggings, a black Peloton-branded sports bra and an orange hat worn backward so it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t cast a shadow across her face.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI almost always wear bright lipstick, too,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n, who has discovered that bright colors pop on camera. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t tend to wear eye shadow because that would be a disaster waiting to happen. You\xe2\x80\x99ll look like a football player.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n runs 50- and 100-mile ultramarathons, and last year she published a motivational guide, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Shut Up and Run'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d After her afternoon class, she did a 10-mile sprint around the city. The evening class would be her third workout of the day. Though instructors care about their on-camera appearance, fitness comes first. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a dog and pony show,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'When it was time to teach her 6:30 class, Ms. Arz\xc3\xb3n went upstairs to the studio to greet the live riders, then was cued in by a producer \xe2\x80\x94 3, 2, 1. The show began, and she gave an over-the-top performance, pounding her hand against the bike frame, cursing as she climbed imaginary mountains, barking out \xe2\x80\x9c20 more seconds!\xe2\x80\x9d to slackers, giving shout-outs to home riders (\xe2\x80\x9cHP, I see you, baby, stay at the top\xe2\x80\x9d), dancing in the saddle to Kanye songs.'b'Fame for instructors at studio franchises like 'b'SoulCycle is intense'b' but tends to be hyperlocal.

She used to live in Dallas and had enjoyed indoor cycling classes at Flywheel. Absent any similar boutique cycling studios in Ames, she went the Peloton route and says she loves it.'b'She and her husband, Matthew, traveled from Iowa in late December to work out in the studio. \xe2\x80\x9cAt first, there was definitely some shock and star-struckness that we were taking Cody\xe2\x80\x99s class,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Stern said, referring to 'b'Cody Rigsby'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, my gosh.

As an eight-time N.B.A. All-Star seemingly dressed for Pitti Uomo (he wore a blue custom suit, a striped pocket square and white Common Projects sneakers), Mr. Durant certainly stood out in the wood-beam suburban sports bar where a number of diners were decked out in blue-and-gold Warriors gear.'b'But even though Jack\xe2\x80\x99s that day looked like a Durant-themed hall of mirrors, with clips of his 'b'epic rejection'b' of a LeBron James shot from the day before flickering on TVs, he was able to walk unmolested through the busy restaurant and take a seat in a rear booth for a plate of boneless hot wings.'b'Mr. Durant is comfortable with the level of scrutiny he receives in the Bay Area, meaning, not too much. \xe2\x80\x9cHey, it\xe2\x80\x99s not L.A., it\xe2\x80\x99s not New York,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s somewhere in between.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Although he has appeared on magazine covers for a decade, he still carries himself like a teenager. He slouched in the booth with his shoulders slumped, face buried in his iPhone before the food arrived.'b'Once the conversation did start, however, Mr. Durant sounded pensive, introspective. Unlike many M.V.P.-caliber athletes who seem to field every question seemingly looking for the quickest exit strategy, Mr. Durant paused to consider each question, and he seemed unafraid to open up, despite his natural shyness.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Durant said of his childhood in Seat Pleasant, Md., which neighbors Washington. \xe2\x80\x9cI was quiet. I was awkward-sized.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Raised by a single mother in a rough neighborhood, Mr. Durant said he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t look the part\xe2\x80\x9d of a cool kid, adding that, \xe2\x80\x9cIt made it easy for me to not worry about the social life and just play basketball.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the gift and the curse of being an athlete that is so dedicated at an early age, you forget about real life sometimes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m just in the last few years starting to feel comfortable to meet new people, going out in groups, meeting new girls, hanging out. That stuff was foreign to me until a few years back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Near the end of the lunch, a petite woman in a Warriors jersey trailing two eager children approached the booth. \xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, Kevin?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked diffidently. But a man in his security detail whisked her away before he could respond.'b'Upon leaving the booth, however, Mr. Durant demonstrated his growing ease with fame among his adopted family of Warriors fans, making a beeline toward the woman\xe2\x80\x99s table to graciously pose for selfies with the family.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey can feel how much heat that I got from coming here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of his controversial move to Bay Area. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make me feel at peace.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fifteen minutes later, the Escalade pulled into a parking garage beneath the sprawling YouTube campus. Mr. Durant had no time for a plunge down the office\xe2\x80\x99s 45-foot-long red slide, sink a 10-footer on the indoor putting green or grab a quick snooze in a Kubrickian, white-plastic \xe2\x80\x9cnap pod.\xe2\x80\x9d After all, he was the employee perk that day.'b'He proceeded to an auditorium that was filled to capacity with YouTube employees, some of them looking barely old enough to vote, let alone drink, and took a seat onstage across from Neal Mohan, YouTube\xe2\x80\x99s chief product officer, who was moderating an employees-only question-and-answer session that was live-streamed to YouTube and Google offices around the world.'b'Flashing a $59,000 Vacheron Constantin watch, Mr. Durant did not exactly fit the profile of the skinny-armed tech programmer. But he cast himself as just another member of the YouTube generation, talking about his obsession with Grand Theft Auto V, hip-hop and, of course, YouTube. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m sure you guys know, you want to look at one quick video and it turns into four or five hours,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s pretty dangerous, that app.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When an audience member asked if he planned to try acting, like the Los Angeles Clippers\xe2\x80\x99 Blake Griffin or the Cavaliers\xe2\x80\x99 LeBron James, Mr. Durant snorted sarcastically, \xe2\x80\x9cIf anybody could do it, it\xe2\x80\x99s Blake Griffin and LeBron.\xe2\x80\x9d The audience erupted in laughter, since both players are considered Oscar-worthy on-court floppers. Mr. Durant, holding back a chuckle, insisted that he was talking about their impressive work in commercials and movies.'b'Then the talk took a more serious turn. Asked if he is plugging himself into the Bay Area tech scene, Mr. Durant responded that he is eagerly following the lead of a Warriors teammate, Andre Iguodala, who is 'b'a noted investor'b' in companies like Twitter, Facebook and Tesla.'b'Last summer, in fact, Mr. Durant and Mr. Kleiman unveiled a start-up of their own, the Durant Company, with a swelling portfolio of investments in tech companies like Postmates and Acorns, in addition to hotels and restaurants and film and television development. They are also investing with Ronald Conway, one of Silicon Valley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csuper angel\xe2\x80\x9d investors and a front-row fixture at Oracle Arena (the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 current home in Oakland), and consulting with Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs\xe2\x80\x99s widow, on his own 'b'charity foundation'b'.'b'In a sense, Mr. Durant is not wholly unlike the legions of ambitious 20-somethings in hoodies and cool sneakers who descend on Silicon Valley to make hundreds of millions.'b'The only difference is, he has already made hundreds of millions.'b'The next day, Mr. Durant was piloting his black Tesla Model S up a windy road in the Oakland Hills, after the Warriors\xe2\x80\x99 morning shootaround. It was around noon on game day, the second meeting of the season with his former team, the Thunder. He seemed more distant that day, his voice quieter, raspier.'b'Dressed in a gray Warriors hoodie, he steered into a hilltop cul-de-sac and pulled into a driveway of his sleek contemporary-style house, where he hopped out, plugged in the Tesla, and headed into the house through a garage where his black labradoodle Ro was resting peacefully.'b'As his private chef hunched over the stove, preparing a game-day pasta meal, Mr. Durant slumped into the world\xe2\x80\x99s longest sectional sofa and stared out the soaring windows, which were rattling from the wind, toward downtown Oakland in the distance. He chose the house for the view.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s beautiful to be on top of everything, see it from a different perspective,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause I was at the bottom growing up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Durant has been living in the 10,000-square-foot rental for only a few months, and as a bachelor who spends half his time on the road, it has a temporary feel to it. The white lilies on the kitchen table were silk, the fiddle-leaf fig plant in the corner of the family room was plastic.'b'Still, it was decorated in a style that might be called Sports Superstar Moderne: the stark white walls are festooned with abstract Expressionist artwork, with ample trophies on display. The house has a home recording studio, a recreation room littered with Washington Redskins memorabilia, a movie theater that seats 16, and a walk-in closet devoted to sneakers.'b'Mr. Durant padded barefoot past his hangar-size master bedroom, into another vast closet where he keeps his custom suits, jewelry and watches. The real treasure there, however, was his swelling collection of vintage concert T-shirts from the 1980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s \xe2\x80\x94 Nas, Biggie, Metallica, Stone Cold Steve Austin. \xe2\x80\x9cI take pride in my collection,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Old T-shirts may seem like an odd obsession for a player who helped pioneer the neo-preppy nerd-chic look (bow ties, Urkel-style glasses and backpacks) that swept the league a few years ago. In 2013, he even covered All-Star weekend as a 'b'fashion correspondent'b' for GQ.'b'But what\xe2\x80\x99s the point of looking runway-ready in a culture where Mark Zuckerberg\xe2\x80\x99s sweatshirt sets the tone? Mr. Durant feels more at home in the Silicon Valley-approved wardrobe of jeans, sneakers and hoodies.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFashion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis what you make of it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Back in the family room, Mr. Durant paused in front of his frame wall containing a moody black-and-white photograph showing three clenched fists, each with a small triangle tattoo at the base of the thumb. One fist was Mr. Durant\xe2\x80\x99s, another belongs to Charlie Bell, a childhood friend who is now a top executive at Jay Z\xe2\x80\x99s agency, Roc Nation, and third to Mr. Kleiman, who still represents Mr. Durant through Jay Z\xe2\x80\x99s Roc Nation Sports and is also working for him directly as his manager and partner in the Durant Company.'b'The photo is a reminder to himself about real friendship, Mr. Durant said. His social world had shrunken since his controversial move.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you make it to the league, especially from where I\xe2\x80\x99m from, it\xe2\x80\x99s like everybody made it,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Durant said. \xe2\x80\x9cI can remember times going to a club, I had 30 people with me. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking to myself, this was never me. But if you\xe2\x80\x99ve never had the support outwardly like that, people showing you affection in your face, love in your face, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s fake, you try to grab that because it feels good for the moment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow, it\xe2\x80\x99s us three.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He may be rounding the math a little bit. Mr. Durant may have called off his engagement with Monica Wright, a W.N.B.A. player, and dialed back the entourage, but he goes out often after games in San Francisco and is quickly making friends with the tech titans who populate Oracle Arena\xe2\x80\x99s version of celebrity row.'b'In September, he celebrated his birthday at a lavish barbecue at the house of Ben Horowitz, the influential venture capitalist and business partner of Marc Andreessen. Two months later, he watched the election results at the home of Eddy Cue, Apple\xe2\x80\x99s senior vice president for internet software and services, along with Tim Cook, Apple chief executive, and Pharrell Williams.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that\xe2\x80\x99s why a lot of athletes and entertainers work well with some of those guys, because for one, they all had humble beginnings,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Durant said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey built something from the ground up, so they can relate to us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Minutes before he was ready to settle down for his 2 p.m. nap, Mr. Durant headed to the real sanctuary in his Oakland home, the recording studio.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMan, why you all keep it so cold in here?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Raleigh Dunn, his recording engineer, while taking a seat in the corner. The lights turned low, Mr. Dunn prepared a sample of the Chi-Lites \xe2\x80\x9cHave You Seen Her\xe2\x80\x9d for Mr. Durant to lay rhymes over. While some might call Mr. Dunn a \xe2\x80\x9cproducer,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Durant has a different name for him: music therapist.'b'At this point, the 'b'N.B.A. star with a sideline in rap'b' has become the stuff of clich\xc3\xa9. Before there was Damian Lillard, there was Kobe Bryant. Before Mr. Bryant, there was Shaquille O\xe2\x80\x99Neal. But those guys were different. They made records. They wanted cred. Mr. Durant\xe2\x80\x99s rhymes are more like an audio diary, intended only for himself and close friends. For him, music is like meditation, or sometimes, primal scream therapy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got so much stuff on my mind, quite honestly, it\xe2\x80\x99s kind of easy for me to say it all here,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Durant said, looking almost monastic with his goateed face hidden in the hood of his sweatshirt. Music, he said, is \xe2\x80\x9ca release. It keeps me in the moment. It takes my mind off this crazy world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a few hours, he would hit the court against the Thunder and Mr. Westbrook, his former teammate. While Mr. Durant has called the supposed feud between the two 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cfake drama\xe2\x80\x9d'b' whipped up by the news media, there are clearly unresolved issues.'b'In their first on-court meeting last November, Mr. Westbrook appeared to 'b'troll'b' Mr. Durant by showing up for the game wearing an orange bib that read \xe2\x80\x9cOfficial Photographer.\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Durant is a budding amateur photographer who shot Super Bowl 50 for 'b'The Players\xe2\x80\x99 Tribune'b', the sports site started by Derek Jeter, and in which Mr. Durant has a stake.)'b'But at the moment, Mr. Durant would only say that latest rhymes were about \xe2\x80\x9crelationship things, both with male friends, females, relationships that might have been broken on both sides.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the beauty of music. Once you put it down on tape, he said, all the nagging issues \xe2\x80\x9care just out of my mind. I can move on to the next thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the age of \xe2\x80\x9cHamilton\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAladdin,\xe2\x80\x9d when shows can gross $2 million a week, gay bars are reflecting the boom with brassy Broadway nights.'b'At three weekly bar nights around town, gay people sing along to theater tunes, cheer Broadway drop-ins and watch drag queens do musical numbers. The combo may not be new ('b'Splash'b', a now-closed club in Chelsea, hosted Musical Mondays for over two decades), but it\xe2\x80\x99s certainly growing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBroadway and the gay community have always belonged together,\xe2\x80\x9d said Clay Smith, who performs under the drag name Delighted Tobehere.'b'Until recently, when Delighted got a lot of out-of-town bookings, Mr. Smith hosted Razzle Dazzle Wednesdays at Pieces, a gay bar on Christopher Street. The crowd of \xe2\x80\x9ctheater queens\xe2\x80\x9d came to see Delighted belt Broadway standards, while the video screen showed films like \xe2\x80\x9cFame.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhether you just stumped your toe, had a breakup or survived the holidays with your Southern Baptist Republican family,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Smith said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe theater can help you get away for a few hours.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most of the Broadway action takes place in Hell\xe2\x80\x99s Kitchen and always on Monday, Broadway\xe2\x80\x99s dark night.'b'At 'b'Therapy'b', a popular gay bar on West 52nd Street, a crowd of 30-something guys in pullover sweaters gathers for Stage Fright, a party hosted by the drag performer Marti Gould Cummings. Highlights have included Adam Pascal from \xe2\x80\x9cRent\xe2\x80\x9d singing \xe2\x80\x9cLight My Candle\xe2\x80\x9d with Mr. Cummings, and Alice Ripley belting out \xe2\x80\x9cSunset Boulevard\xe2\x80\x9d classics.'b'The two-time Tony winner Michael Cerveris (for \xe2\x80\x9cAssassins\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cFun Home\xe2\x80\x9d) showed up in January, and after Mr. Cummings delivered a doo-wop version of \xe2\x80\x9cMy Heart Will Go On\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cTitanic\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Cerveris was in the Broadway musical of the same story), the two engaged in some irreverent banter.'b'Favorite co-star? \xe2\x80\x9cPatti LuPone is a force of nature,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cerveris said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvery guest I\xe2\x80\x99ve had says \xe2\x80\x98Patti,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cummings replied.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe will cut you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cerveris replied, laughing, adding an unprintable vulgarity for effect.'b'Mr. Cerveris then shared that \xe2\x80\x9cFinishing the Hat\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cSunday in the Park With George'b'\xe2\x80\x9d'b' was his most frequent audition song, before proceeding to sing it to an appreciative audience, with live piano accompaniment.'b'Across the street, 'b'Industry Bar'b' is the setting for the weekly party Diva, a slick revue starring the virtuoso singer Marty Thomas and rotating guests. Mr. Thomas said he started the event six years ago \xe2\x80\x9cto feature talent in their human element, not in character.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Broadway stars can stretch here with pop songs, and last year, Idina Menzel came by to debut her new single, \xe2\x80\x9cI See You.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey freaked out,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Thomas said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they always freak out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Thomas added: \xe2\x80\x9cI hate when judges on those reality shows say, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re just too theater.\xe2\x80\x99 I think, \xe2\x80\x98You should be so lucky!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A few blocks away on 10th Avenue, 'b'Hardware Bar'b' has a more intimate party called Broadway Mondays, in a back room, where the small stage is backed by silver tinsel and the wall video shows images from \xe2\x80\x9cSweet Charity,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cGrease\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCats.\xe2\x80\x9d Now in its third year, the Monday-night party has attracted Broadway figures including Billy Porter (\xe2\x80\x9cKinky Boots\xe2\x80\x9d) and Telly Leung (\xe2\x80\x9cAllegiance\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI missed Musical Mondays at Splash and decided to make my own so I had somewhere to go,\xe2\x80\x9d said Justin Luke, who promotes the party with the drag performer Sutton Lee Seymour.'b'On a recent Monday, the drag queen Cacophony Daniels, who is actually the Broadway actor Courter Simmons from \xe2\x80\x9cJersey Boys,\xe2\x80\x9d sang \xe2\x80\x9cBe Our Guest\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty and the Beast,\xe2\x80\x9d while spinning, belting and high kicking.'b'Mr. Simmons then poked fun at the live-action movie version of \xe2\x80\x9cBeauty and the Beast,\xe2\x80\x9d starring Emma Watson, who doesn\xe2\x80\x99t usually sing onscreen.
