b'Picture it: Manhattan, 2017. A crisp Saturday morning. Every table in Rue La Rue Cafe \xe2\x80\x94 a new restaurant in Washington Heights dedicated to 'b'Rue McClanahan'b' and her hit television series, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Golden Girls\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was occupied, including one in a replica of the kitchen set from the show. The pumps Ms. McClanahan (Blanche) wore in the pilot episode are displayed in a glass case. Mannequins draped in her gowns surrounded a pianist and guitarist playing mellow jazz on a corner stage. Behind them, on a pedestal, was her 1987 Emmy for lead actress.'b'When the musicians took a break, a mounted television was turned up so customers could watch episodes that play steadily. Conversation happily quieted as 'b'Bea Arthur'b' (Dorothy) and Hal Linden were heard saying good night after a sixth-season date.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a museum!\xe2\x80\x9d said a woman in line to order.'b'From behind the counter, the co-owner, Michael J. LaRue, replied, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a museum with good food.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Few series radiate the necessary warmth to justify a tribute restaurant, but \xe2\x80\x9cThe Golden Girls,\xe2\x80\x9d that enduring electric blanket of American television, is a part of the culture that people have held tight. It has been 25 years since the end of the sitcom about four older Miami housemates \xe2\x80\x94 Dorothy, the salty wit; Rose (Betty White), the lovable dim bulb; Sophia ('b'Estelle Getty'b'), the Italian spitfire; and Blanche, the Southern vixen \xe2\x80\x94 but fans keep finding new ways to love it, with countless parodies, action figures and T-shirts, and Hulu\xe2\x80\x99s recent nabbing of exclusive streaming rights.'b'For all the show\xe2\x80\x99s zany plots, what fans seem to cherish most are the intimate scenes in which the four friends sit around their kitchen table, sharing a cheesecake and talking into the night.'b'That spirit has now become a guiding force for Mr. LaRue, 53, who owns the restaurant with Ms. McClanahan\xe2\x80\x99s son, Mark Bish. Mr. LaRue first met Ms. McClanahan at an animal rights charity event at Studio 54. They quickly became best friends, he said, and she repeatedly asked him, in jest, to marry her so she could be Rue LaRue. When Ms. McClanahan died in 2010, he became the executor of her estate, which includes an extensive personal archive that Ms. McClanahan wanted made available to her fans.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA little voice in my head said, \xe2\x80\x98Restaurant!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. LaRue said during a recent interview.'b'A 16-year resident of Washington Heights, he had no other neighborhood in mind for the new spot. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore, we\xe2\x80\x99d have to go downtown for good food and live entertainment,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want people to stay in the neighborhood, and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t live here, to come uptown.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Construction on the space, formerly a pet store, lasted nearly a year. The bathroom was outfitted to match the show\xe2\x80\x99s pink and mint tiles, with a bawdy door Ms. McClanahan had designed for her California house. The banana leaf Martinique wallpaper on two walls was hand-cut to match its exact look in Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s bedroom.'b'CHOCnyc, an Inwood bakery, created a cheesecake in honor of each Girl, and the Bronx Brewery provided two custom beers. The menu, from Michele Weber, formerly the chef at Good Enough to Eat, will feature nods to the show \xe2\x80\x94 lasagna al forno, Gen\xc3\xbcgenfl\xc3\xbcrgen cake \xe2\x80\x94 and recipes shared by the cast: Ms. Arthur\xe2\x80\x99s chutney, Ms. White\xe2\x80\x99s angel food cake, Ms. Getty\xe2\x80\x99s pasta salad. There are also signature coffee blends: Sophia\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPicture It\xe2\x80\x9d Sicilian Roast (inspired by a favorite line of the character), Rose\xe2\x80\x99s St. Olaf blend, Dorothy\xe2\x80\x99s No-Nonsense Roast, and, for a little spice, Blanche\xe2\x80\x99s Gentlemen Caller\xe2\x80\x99s Beans.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy grandma loved the show,\xe2\x80\x9d said Patrick Rickerfor, 41, who was making his fourth visit to Rue La Rue. \xe2\x80\x9cShe was from Honduras and didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand English all that well, but she got the slapstick comedy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ana Perez, 28, was back for the second day in a row. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Blanche,\xe2\x80\x9d she admitted proudly. Anabel Perez, 23, her sister, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Dorothy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a little Sophia over there,\xe2\x80\x9d Ana added, gesturing to their young cousin, buried in a game on her smartphone. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was my favorite show growing up. That episode where Mario Lopez got deported makes me cry.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Junko (a Sophia) and Paul Lindberg (a Rose) were grocery-shopping when they noticed that the cafe had opened. They threw their bags down at home and raced over.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe used to walk by here every day, thinking, \xe2\x80\x98When\xe2\x80\x99s it going to open?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Lindberg said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mom in Japan keeps asking me, \xe2\x80\x98Is that cafe open yet?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bix Gabriel, from Bloomington, Ind., and her sister Marisa Gabriel, from Adelaide, Australia, overheard talk of the place in an Ethiopian restaurant a few nights earlier and frantically Googled. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sang the theme song coming in,\xe2\x80\x9d Bix Gabriel said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe show was so progressive and ahead of its time,\xe2\x80\x9d Joe Samalian, Ms. Gabriel\xe2\x80\x99s husband, added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt passes the 'b'Bechdel test'b' like you wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t believe.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI must say,\xe2\x80\x9d Marisa Gabriel said, leaning in, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Golden Girls\xe2\x80\x99 is the best cure for postpartum depression. I have two children, and I watched it each time, and it helped me immensely.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. LaRue echoed a similar sentiment: \xe2\x80\x9cI know people who put on \xe2\x80\x98Golden Girls\xe2\x80\x99 DVDs the way others take a Valium.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One of the walls features photographs of Ms. McClanahan\xe2\x80\x99s six husbands, while another is dedicated to Ms. White, the last surviving Girl, who hopes to get to Rue La Rue in the spring. Near the end of Ms. McClanahan\xe2\x80\x99s life, Ms. White sent her a fresh orchid every week, as well as pears and oranges from California.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe would call and say, \xe2\x80\x98Can I talk to Ruesy?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. LaRue recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cOne day, right before the stroke, do you know what they were talking about? Ryan Reynolds. Betty was in that movie \xe2\x80\x98The Proposal,\xe2\x80\x99 and Rue\xe2\x80\x99s in the hospital, like, \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s that young man? He\xe2\x80\x99s delicious.\xe2\x80\x99 She was boy-crazy up until the last minute of her life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. LaRue is full of these stories, and happy to share them. \xe2\x80\x9cShe sewed for me, she baked for me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy mother died when I was 8 years old. I had this hole in my being that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t even realize.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A sidewalk plaque at the entrance bears Ms. McClanahan\xe2\x80\x99s name and the opening lyrics of the show\xe2\x80\x99s theme song, \xe2\x80\x9cThank You for Being a Friend.\xe2\x80\x9d Some of her ashes are buried underneath.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s never a time when \xe2\x80\x98The Golden Girls\xe2\x80\x99 is not playing on this globe,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. LaRue said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt taps into something that we all share as human beings \xe2\x80\x94 a fear that as we age we\xe2\x80\x99re going to become irrelevant and alone. The show is a tonic for that fear. It says you can still look good and have sex and have a very full life, with friends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI once asked Rue why she got married so often, and she said, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to die alone,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd she didn\xe2\x80\x99t; I was there, holding her. I was able to look in her eyes and tell her, \xe2\x80\x98Everything\xe2\x80\x99s going to be O.K., you have nothing to worry about.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He smiled, suddenly teary. \xe2\x80\x9cI still miss her.\xe2\x80\x9d Looking around the cafe, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cBut she would love this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On the television, Ms. McClanahan, Ms. Arthur and Ms. White sang \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Sandman\xe2\x80\x9d to lull a baby to sleep. Patrons, seeking shelter from the cold, happily watched.'b'The baby quieted, and the Girls tried to tiptoe off. He cried, and they started up again. They sang until he slept.'b'In New York at the end of the 1970s, many people thought painting was all washed up. And if not washed up, it had to be abstract \xe2\x80\x94 the more austere, unemotional and geometric, the better.'b'Then came the 1980s and a generation of young painters, like Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Eric Fischl, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, and everything changed. With 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFast Forward: Painting From the 1980s,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' an irresistible if flawed exhibition, the Whitney Museum tries to sort out how that happened.'b'The \xe2\x80\x9980s artists were initially called Neo-Expressionist, an insufficient term, given their stylistic diversity, but one that signaled their accessibility and flair. They drew from art history, the news, graffiti and pop culture. Their work embraced different forms of narrative, often with psychological or erotic overtones, and new kinds of self-awareness and worldliness. Even those who painted abstractly had it, in the form of humor or outside references. Across the board, many worked in large scale, often physically eccentric ways. Mr. Schnabel\xe2\x80\x99s habit of painting on broken crockery became an emblem of the moment, but was only one variation on the bulked-up or expanded forms of collage devised by these artists.'b'In a sense, the painting that emerged in the early \xe2\x80\x9980s was mongrel and illegitimate. In logical art-historical terms, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t supposed to happen. The much-heralded Pictures Generation, a group of photo-based nonpainters, could trace its pedigree to 1970s Conceptual and performance art, and promised an orderly succession. But this divide is often exaggerated: I can imagine painters like Mr. Schnabel and Mr. Fischl thinking, if the Conceptual and performance artists, and their Pictures Generation progeny, can use figures and tell stories, we can, too.'b'The Neo-Expressionists were an instant hit. The phrases \xe2\x80\x9cart star\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csellout show\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting list\xe2\x80\x9d gained wide usage, sometimes linked to artists you\xe2\x80\x99d barely heard of. Appearances in glossy magazines became routine. And many people were not happy. The Minimalist sculptor Donald Judd wrote that \xe2\x80\x9ctalent may strike\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Salle and that Mr. Schnabel \xe2\x80\x9cmay grow up.\xe2\x80\x9d Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, a leading art theorist, labeled them \xe2\x80\x9cciphers of regression\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 insignificant, backward daubers who would soon disappear.'b'For a long time, that seemed to be the case. Over the last quarter-century, \xe2\x80\x9980s painting has tended to be ignored, if not maligned for the macho persona projected by some of its practitioners, and for reheating the art market after the relatively quiet, supposedly pure \xe2\x80\x9970s.'b'The Whitney show is the first attempt by a New York museum to survey this period, to feature the art stars of Neo-Expressionism but also to include lesser-knowns and to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x94 as with any period \xe2\x80\x94 that there was much more going on.'b'The heady sense of the 1980s is felt right off the elevator in three works rooted in street art and graffiti, each presenting a complex world in a distinct style. Kenny Scharf\xe2\x80\x99s mural-size \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Worlds Collide\xe2\x80\x9d (1984)'b'is a cartoon-graffiti outer-space fantasy, mostly in red. Basquiat\xe2\x80\x99s 1982 painting 'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b''b'LNAPRK\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (for the Luna Park outside Milan) \xe2\x80\x94 half turquoise, half black, with an idiosyncratic use of stretcher bars \xe2\x80\x94 presents a bristling stream-of-consciousness overlay of cartoon faces, a bull\xe2\x80\x99s head scavenged from Picasso, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cItaly in the 1500\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cessen\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 eat in German \xe2\x80\x94 repeated three times. These works are hung on walls covered with Haring\xe2\x80\x99s black-and-white graffiti figure patterns \xe2\x80\x94 as well known as Mr. Schnabel\xe2\x80\x99s plates \xe2\x80\x94 along with an untitled and unusual Haring piece. Rendered in felt-tip on synthetic animal hide, like a jazzed-up prehistoric work, it presents the implicitly moral Haring universe with figures and symbols signifying love and war, life and death, the satanic and the religious, all interlocking.'b'Drawn from the Whitney\xe2\x80\x99s collection, \xe2\x80\x9cFast Forward\xe2\x80\x9d has great moments, in individual efforts and the groupings worked out by its organizers, Jane Panetta, an associate curator, and Melinda Lang, a curatorial assistant. They allow the paintings to complement, but also challenge, one another.'b'In the first gallery, we can compare the different styles and emotional urgencies in three big paintings by Mr. Fischl, Mr. Schnabel, and Leon Golub. The 1983 Fischl diptych 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA Visit To / A Visit From / the Island\xe2\x80\x9d'b' contrasts frolicking white people and struggling Haitians on different tropical beaches, starkly raising the issues of the world\xe2\x80\x99s refugee crises and what is now called white privilege. Its loosely painted realism owes something to both news photos and the Ashcan School.'b'Opposite is Golub\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhite Squad I,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' from 1982, in which three mercenaries or soldiers (who are not all white by the way) stand over the prone bodies of a brown-skinned man and woman who seem to have been beaten. All the figures float against a background stained rust-red, evoking heat, violence and blood but also the heroic color fields of Abstract Expressionism. The huge canvas, unstretched, and flat to the wall, has the grandeur of a Renaissance fresco.'b'Between them, Mr. Schnabel\xe2\x80\x99s vibrant 'b' \xe2\x80\x9cHope,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' from 1982, conjures a diffuse existential unease grounded in European motifs. A skull, a crucifix and the suggestion of a sorrowing Rubenesque nude press in on a naked man (possibly the artist) who may be leaving them behind. At once absurd and solemn, it is rendered in big splintery brush strokes of gorgeous colors on a patchwork collage of gold and blue velvet (the blue resembles an overheated Titian sky). On view at the Whitney for only the second time in 20 years, this painting is a breathtaking sight.'b'The second gallery groups together stars, like Mr. Salle, with others, including Joyce Pensato, overlooked until recently, who dallied in the images of popular culture, pulling its meanings in provocative directions. Mr. Salle\xe2\x80\x99s harlequin figures, painted from color reproductions against tones of blue and orange, are splayed across the top half of his 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSextant in Dogtown,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' from 1987. Below this elegant mix of old and modern are three inky renderings, indelibly contemporary, based on photographs Mr. Salle took of a seminude woman holding a garment in one instance and a Noguchi lamp in another. The work is an outstanding example of Mr. Salle\xe2\x80\x99s visual sophistication.'b'In comparison, Kathe Burkhart\xe2\x80\x99s blunt \xe2\x80\x9cPrick: From the Liz Taylor Series (Suddenly Last Summer),\xe2\x80\x9d from 1987, reprises a movie scene with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift in exuberantly trashy paint, vinyl and fake gold leaf. Walter Robinson\xe2\x80\x99s painting \xe2\x80\x9cBaron Sinister\xe2\x80\x9d (1986) places a heavy-breathing pulp-fiction cover on a demure field of white Rymanesque brushwork, and Peter Cain\xe2\x80\x99s hyper-real \xe2\x80\x9cZ\xe2\x80\x9d (1989) reduces a gleaming ad-ready image of a car to a phallus on wheels.'b'The final gallery brings a welcome calmness with work tending toward a more anchored, inward feeling. It is reigned over by Terry Winters\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood Government\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (1984), a large and beautiful painting of molecular forms adrift in a cream-colored space, whose title has suddenly gained new resonance. Mary Heilmann\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBig Bill\xe2\x80\x9d (1987), a wide white band angling through a field of blue, gives abstraction an insouciant nonchalance, while the wavy green and red lines of Moira Dryer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cPortrait of a Fingerprint\xe2\x80\x9d are hypnotically oceanic. The least-known artist here is Carlos Alfonzo, whose \xe2\x80\x9cTold,\xe2\x80\x9d from 1990, is a big burly form in dark colors. Its power is lessened by the sketchy figure at its center that may represent Mr. Alfonzo\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge that he had AIDS. (He would die in 1991.) But the work brims with talent and ambition.'b'The Whitney show is quite satisfying \xe2\x80\x94 even revelatory \xe2\x80\x94 since many works have not been on view in years. But the exhibition\xe2\x80\x99s unrealized potential is equally visible. To start with, the Whitney\xe2\x80\x99s collection has some unfortunate gaps. Among the most glaring is the absence of one of 'b'Philip Taaffe\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'burnished reprises of the \xe2\x80\x9960s Op Art paintings of Bridget Riley or Victor Vasarely, which operated in the gray area between the Neo-Expressionists and the Pictures Generation.'b'Also, \xe2\x80\x9cFast Forward\xe2\x80\x9d has not been given enough room to even take advantage of outstanding \xe2\x80\x9980s paintings the museum already owns. Over a dozen artists are represented with small works mostly on paper crowded salon-style on one wall, which is insulting. But there are pleasant surprises here: early works by Andrew Masullo; a Nancy Spero collage; and a painterly, highly personal Glenn Ligon. With more space, some of these artists could have been represented by larger efforts.'b'The show reminds us that art doesn\xe2\x80\x99t adhere neatly to decades; what we consider \xe2\x80\x9980s painting began in the 1970s and extended into the 1990s. Too bad the curators didn\xe2\x80\x99t stretch the decade a bit more. They could have added Joe Zucker\xe2\x80\x99s funny beautiful \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Merlyn\xe2\x80\x99s Lab'b',\xe2\x80\x9d from 1977, whose mosaiclike surface of color-soaked cotton balls presages Mr. Schnabel\xe2\x80\x99s broken crockery. Elizabeth Murray\xe2\x80\x99s great 1978 painting \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Children Meeting'b'\xe2\x80\x9d also deserves to be here. With its bold-scale, brilliant colors and grand biomorphic evocations of cartooning and Surrealism, this is among the first paintings of the American 1980s and would have given Mr. Scharf\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the Worlds Collide\xe2\x80\x9d a run for its money.'b'Nonetheless, \xe2\x80\x9cFast Forward\xe2\x80\x9d reveals a complex subject crying out for attention by outlining how the Neo-Expressionists and their \xe2\x80\x9980s cohort broke painting wide open. Their legacy is a sense of freedom and possibility that infuses the medium to this day.'b'NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 At most dinner galas, the presence of a Supreme Court justice would be reason enough to crow. But some of the 500 supporters of the 'b'Claremont Institute'b' who gathered here on Feb. 11 to see Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. accept a statesmanship award also had the group\xe2\x80\x99s links to an even more powerful eminence on their minds.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMany Claremonsters have the ear of this administration and may help Trump take what he feels in his gut and migrate it to his head,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas D. Klingenstein, the institute\xe2\x80\x99s board chairman, declared from the stage, repurposing an old insult as a badge of honor.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is Claremont\xe2\x80\x99s moment,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a time to judge Claremont by its press. The more bad press, the better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Klingenstein was referring to the continuing furor around 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Flight 93 Election,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' an incendiary pro-Trump polemic that appeared in September on the website of The Claremont Review of Books, the institute\xe2\x80\x99s flagship publication. Published under the pseudonym Publius Decius Mus, the essay compared the American republic to a hijacked airliner, with a vote for Donald J. Trump as the risky, but existentially necessary, course.'b'Decius\xe2\x80\x99 apocalyptic vision \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cCharge the cockpit or you die\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 stirred intense rebuttals from the overwhelmingly anti-Trump conservative intellectual establishment. Then The Weekly Standard 'b'revealed'b' that Decius was Michael Anton, a senior staff member at the National Security Council, and a news media stampede was on.'b'The Intercept called his writings the \xe2\x80\x9cintellectual source code of Trumpism.\xe2\x80\x9d Salon put him alongside Stephen K. Bannon and Stephen Miller in the administration\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwhite nationalist \xe2\x80\x98genius bar,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d while the conservative writer (and staunch Never-Trumper) William Kristol, writing on Twitter, compared him to the Nazi theorist Carl Schmitt.'b'It certainly added up to a publicity coup for a small West Coast institute known for summer seminars at which young conservatives immerse themselves in the Federalist Papers and other classics of American political thought. Suddenly, The Claremont Review, an erudite journal with a mere 13,000 subscribers, was being hailed as the bible of highbrow Trumpism \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ccrucially important,\xe2\x80\x9d as the journalist Damon Linker 'b'wrote'b', \xe2\x80\x9cfor anyone seeking to understand the evolution of the Republican and conservative movement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not that the journal is pro-Trump, mind you. Charles R. Kesler, the editor, said that he had sought out \xe2\x80\x9crobust debate,\xe2\x80\x9d publishing some Never-Trumpers alongside pro-Trumpers and those who call themselves 'b'\xe2\x80\x9canti-anti-Trump.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The institute\xe2\x80\x99s president and chief executive, Michael Pack, also noted that Claremont\xe2\x80\x99s affiliates \xe2\x80\x94 who include the former Bush administration lawyer John Yoo (a 'b'strong Trump critic'b') and Senator Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas (\xe2\x80\x9cone of Trumpism\xe2\x80\x99s leading voices,\xe2\x80\x9d as a headline in The Washington Post recently 'b'put it'b') \xe2\x80\x94 were of many minds about the new president.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Claremont Institute stands for deep, serious thinking about American founding principles,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pack said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not simply in the partisan fight.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But some Claremont-watchers take a darker view, saying the institute\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual principles have been, to continue the aviation metaphor, left on the runway.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have completely abandoned every principle on which they stood and have endorsed a man who seems to have no interest in or knowledge of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d Steven B. Smith, a political science professor at Yale, said. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though Trump may be completely unhinged, the idea is they can nevertheless kind of slipstream behind him and smuggle their agenda in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Claremont mission, according to the institute\xe2\x80\x99s website, is to \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat progressivism\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9crestore the principles of the American Founding to their rightful, pre-eminent place in American life.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Mr. Kesler\xe2\x80\x99s office on the manicured campus of Claremont McKenna College in Claremont, Calif., where he is a professor of government, could not seem more distant from the corridors of power, let alone the chaos of actually existing Trumpism. (The institute, founded in 1979, is not affiliated with the college.)'b'The d\xc3\xa9cor is standard-issue professor, down to the desk piled with books relating to American political thought, including his own edition of the 'b'Federalist Papers'b' \xe2\x80\x94 the top-selling edition in the country, he noted \xe2\x80\x94 and an anthology of Woodrow Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s political writings.'b'Wilson, as it happens, is a favorite Claremont b\xc3\xaate noire: the founder of the modern \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative state,\xe2\x80\x9d the unelected, unaccountable rule-by-bureaucracy that has, the story goes, usurped the founders\xe2\x80\x99 vision of rule by the people (and which reached its apogee with Barack Obama, Mr. Kesler argued in his 2012 book, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI Am the Change\xe2\x80\x9d'b').'b'But Mr. Kesler, an unfailingly genial West Virginian, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to mind Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s intellectual company. \xe2\x80\x9cI actually like Wilson,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, not politically.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He takes a similarly cheerful view of the ruckus over the essay. He brought up Mr. Kristol\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintemperate\xe2\x80\x9d tweet, but noted that his old friend had recently come to the college for a conference about an essay by the political philosopher Leo Strauss.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA secret Straussian conclave!\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kesler said with a laugh, then paused. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t call it that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Strauss\xe2\x80\x99s intensely close readings of Plato, Maimonides and Machiavelli can seem remote from contemporary politics. But during the Bush administration, much ink was spilled over the 'b'subterranean influence'b' of Straussians like Mr. Kristol, who championed the war in Iraq. And now some see the Claremont crowd\xe2\x80\x99s rising profile as revenge of the so-called West Coast Straussians, as acolytes of 'b'Harry V. Jaffa'b' \xe2\x80\x94 the Claremont McKenna professor and Claremont Institute patriarch who died in 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 are known.'b'The Straussian lineages, and their 'b'fierce schisms'b', are notoriously complex. But Mr. Kesler, who studied under the Straussian Harvey C. Mansfield at Harvard but came to Claremont in 1983, gamely summed up the West Coast view as hinging on a more optimistic take on America.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe East Coast view was that America was a Lockean nation, purely modern, based on radically individual and almost selfish rights: your life, your liberty, your property,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'But Mr. Jaffa, a deep student of 'b'Abraham Lincoln'b', \xe2\x80\x9cthought that America was a heroic country,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kesler continued. \xe2\x80\x9cNot always, maybe only when it had to be. But it could be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The tension between Athens (reason) and Jerusalem (faith) was one of Strauss\xe2\x80\x99s great themes. But reconciling Athens and Mar-a-Lago may be a challenge of an entirely different order.'b'Mr. Yoo, now a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley, recalled with amusement a dinner last summer with a dozen Claremonters at a Philadelphia restaurant famous for singing waiters, where he was startled to realize that many of his Aristotle-quoting tablemates were pro-Trump.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBetween arias, I had to listen to these very distinguished scholars go on about the great intellectual virtues of Donald Trump,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was hard to keep down my wonderful Sicilian meal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Polemics like \xe2\x80\x9cThe Flight 93 Election\xe2\x80\x9d represent something of a departure for The Claremont Review, founded in 2000 as a conservative, if eclectic, answer to The New York Review of Books. Previous contributions by Mr. Anton, a former Jaffa student, include meditations on French cooking, several articles about Tom Wolfe and perhaps the only 'b'essay'b' on the Beach Boys to cite both Brian Wilson and the social scientist James Q. Wilson.'b'When Mr. Anton submitted an earlier essay written as Decius, Mr. Kesler rejected it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as well argued as I would have liked,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. (It was published in March, under the title \xe2\x80\x9cToward a Sensible, Coherent Trumpism,\xe2\x80\x9d by The Journal of American Greatness, a website that has since closed and been reborn as 'b'American Greatness'b'.)'b'Decius\xe2\x80\x99 main target in the \xe2\x80\x9cFlight 93\xe2\x80\x9d essay was the fat-and-happy conservative establishment \xe2\x80\x94 Conservatism Inc. \xe2\x80\x94 which had failed to stand up to \xe2\x80\x9cthe ceaseless importation of third world foreigners,\xe2\x80\x9d among other ills. Mr. Kesler said that he found the tone of apocalyptic urgency exaggerated but compared the essay to the clarion call of Thomas Paine\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCommon Sense.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnton was trying to wake people up, and he did,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kesler said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was very happy to publish it. But I was also happy to publish others who added some 'b'caveats'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Flight 93 Election\xe2\x80\x9d included some jabs at Mr. Kesler\xe2\x80\x99s more cautious anti-anti-Trump position. Since then, he has moved in a more clearly pro- direction.'b'In an essay in the latest issue of The Claremont Review, Mr. Kesler calls Mr. Trump a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense conservative\xe2\x80\x9d whose views on trade, immigration and foreign policy represent a return to the pre-New Deal Republican Party \xe2\x80\x94 more Calvin Coolidge 2.0 than the tyrannical Caesar \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federalist Papers\xe2\x80\x9d warned against.'b'Mr. Trump lacks a tyrant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdark political soul,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kesler said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s more of a bull in a china shop.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And what about charges that the bull is trampling the Constitution? Mr. Kesler offered a perspective that was half wait-and-see, half told-you-so.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s always amusing but heartening to hear liberals talk about the separation of powers, the independent judiciary and other inhibitions on executive action,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you\xe2\x80\x99re the out-party, you discover the utility of these constitutional protections.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d be happier if they discovered not just their utility but their nobility as well.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'TRYON, N.C. \xe2\x80\x94 If you wanted to make a pilgrimage to the childhood home of 'b'W.E.B. Du Bois'b' in Massachusetts or 'b'Malcolm X'b' in Nebraska, you\xe2\x80\x99d have to settle for a historical marker: The houses of those civil rights activists were lost before preservationists could save them, as many important African-American historical sites have been.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s a fate that easily could have met a humble three-room clapboard perched on a rise in this tiny, pretty town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, unknown even to many residents until a few years ago. For those who knew that 30 East Livingston Street was the birthplace of Tryon\xe2\x80\x99s most famous resident \xe2\x80\x94 the singer, soul legend and civil rights icon Nina Simone \xe2\x80\x94 the house\xe2\x80\x99s appearance on the market late last year crystallized fears that its existence, as stubborn as that of Simone herself, might be coming to an end.'b'And that, unexpectedly, is where the New York art world entered the picture.'b'Over the last month, four prominent African-American artists \xe2\x80\x94 the conceptualist 'b'Adam Pendleton'b', the sculptor and painter 'b'Rashid Johnson'b', the collagist and filmmaker 'b'Ellen Gallagher'b' and the abstract painter 'b'Julie Mehretu'b' \xe2\x80\x94 quietly got together, pooled their money and bested competing bids to snatch the house up for $95,000. They describe the purchase as an act of art but also of politics, a gratifying chance to respond to what they see as a deepening racial divide in America, when Simone\xe2\x80\x99s fiery example of culture warrior seems more potent than ever.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t long after the election that this all began to happen, and I was desperate like a lot of people to be engaged, and this felt like exactly the right way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Johnson, 39, whose work, like that of Ms. Gallagher and Mr. Pendleton, often directly engages issues of race and political power. (Mr. Johnson recently signed on to direct a feature film based on \xe2\x80\x9cNative Son,\xe2\x80\x9d Richard Wright\xe2\x80\x99s classic novel of racial oppression.) \xe2\x80\x9cMy feeling when I learned that this house existed was just an incredible urgency to make sure it didn\xe2\x80\x99t go away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Simone died in 2003, at 70, but her presence may be 'b'felt even more strongly now'b' than it was during many years of a life marked by struggles with mental illness and marital abuse. She has been the subject of three films in the last two years; President Obama 'b'tweeted'b' that one of her songs was in rotation on his summer 2016 playlist, and Ford (to the disapproval of many fans) used her anthem \xe2\x80\x9cI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\xe2\x80\x9d in an ad during this year\xe2\x80\x99s Super Bowl.'b'She was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon on Feb. 21, 1933, the sixth child of John Divine Waymon, a dry-cleaning shop owner and handyman, and Mary Kate Waymon, a Methodist minister, who had come to Tryon in the late 1920s during a short-lived period when their family was prospering financially.'b'Simone was delivered in the house, and she retained fond memories of the family\xe2\x80\x99s years there, despite the number of children packed into its 660 square feet, with no running water. She remembered her mother hoisting her onto the kitchen counter and giving her \xe2\x80\x9can empty jam-jar to cut out the biscuit shapes in the dough, singing all the while,\xe2\x80\x9d as she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI Put a Spell on You.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (Simone adopted her stage name in the 1950s while working at a divey nightclub, trying to keep that fact from her mother.)'b'Tryon, though segregated, was a town with less pronounced racial divisions than those in the cities around it or in states further south. White residents, proud of Eunice Waymon\xe2\x80\x99s musical prodigy, established a fund to pay for piano lessons and to send her to a private high school. But even so, her consciousness was seared as early as 11, at her first public recital, in a library building that still stands, when her parents, seated proudly in the front row, were moved to the back. Their daughter refused to perform until they were allowed to return to their seats.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe day after the recital, I walked around as if I had been flayed,\xe2\x80\x9d Simone wrote, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cBut the skin grew back a little tougher, a little less innocent and a little more black.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Her anger toward the town, expressed occasionally in interviews, and undoubtedly also the full-throated rage about racial injustice at the heart of her work \xe2\x80\x94 in songs like 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMississippi Goddam\xe2\x80\x9d'b' \xe2\x80\x94 fueled resentment that residents say lingers in Tryon to this day. Those feelings probably contributed to a lack of recognition for her there until relatively recently. (A bronze statue of Simone was dedicated along the main street in 2010, but the fund-raising effort for the statue 'b'fell short amid squabbling'b'.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are folks here who really don\xe2\x80\x99t want the story told because it\xe2\x80\x99s still felt that Nina Simone did the town a disservice in turning her back on it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin McIntyre, a former economic development director for Polk County, which includes Tryon. Mr. McIntyre bought the house in 2005 and spent more than $100,000 of his own money restoring it to its 1930s state before running into money troubles and losing it.'b'Mr. McIntyre, known as Kipp, nurtured visions of making the house into a museum and community center, and 'b'sought out Simone\xe2\x80\x99s oldest living sibling'b', her brother 'b'Carrol Waymon'b', a retired psychologist in San Diego, to get every period detail right, down to a crank telephone and pump organ. \xe2\x80\x9cI had to sell my truck to pay for the vintage windows,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McIntyre said.'b'The house, one of a few where the Waymons lived in Tryon, sat in the midst of what was for many years the economic heart of the town\xe2\x80\x99s African-American community, near a thriving store and restaurant and laundry. \xe2\x80\x9cMy interest in the house became more of an interest in that history,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. McIntyre said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich I was watching disappear before my eyes as houses got knocked down and fewer people remembered.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The grapevine that buzzed into action to try to save the house after it came up for sale again started with 'b'Verne Dawson'b', a New York painter who owns a small farm outside of nearby Saluda. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever anyone visited I\xe2\x80\x99d take them to see it, because to me her life just gets more important with each passing year,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut that part of North Carolina is a very hostile environment to architecture. It\xe2\x80\x99s a very rainy place, and the vines just grow. If you leave a house for a few years you might not be able to find it when you come back. I feared it would just disintegrate and go away even if no one knocked it down.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Dawson talked to his wife, Laura Hoptman, a curator at the Museum of Modern Art, and the two wondered if they could get someone in the music industry interested. But then Ms. Hoptman began to think about artists who would have both the interest and the means, and she called Mr. Pendleton, 33, whom she has known for several years and whose 'b'profile has been rising rapidly'b' in the art world.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt took me about five seconds to know what I wanted to do, and I called Rashid and we talked and we knew we wanted to get women artists involved, and it all happened very quickly,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Pendleton said, while driving from Charlotte, N.C., in mid-February on a trip to see the house for the first time. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t have a blueprint for our ideas yet, but I think sometimes artists are the best people to deal with really tricky questions \xe2\x80\x94 like, for instance, how to honor the legacy of someone as vital and complicated as Nina Simone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ms. Gallagher, 51, added: \xe2\x80\x9cWe just hope we can activate this place.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe formed a lot of who I am and my sense of history. And I think of the town as a portal to a woman who influenced so many.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Word is only now beginning to spread in town that the house has gained powerful benefactors. But if Mr. Pendleton\xe2\x80\x99s reception was any indication of the feeling of the house\xe2\x80\x99s supporters, the new owners might be welcomed as long-awaited saviors. The broker for the sale, Cindy Viehman, started to shake Mr. Pendleton\xe2\x80\x99s hand upon meeting him but then grabbed him. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just going to give you a hug,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Viehman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been talking to this guy every day! I\xe2\x80\x99ve got him on speed dial. We\xe2\x80\x99re so glad to see you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. McIntyre, who spent so many years trying to save the house, added: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is really what we\xe2\x80\x99ve been praying for. We wanted a place that, in the right hands, would become inspirational not only as a relic of the past but as a catalyst for right now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The 'b'diplomatic travails'b' of President Trump and his past Twitter fixation with 'b'Kristen Stewart'b' provided plenty of fodder for \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d this weekend. But a sketch lampooning 'b'Sean M. Spicer'b', the White House press secretary, in which he was impersonated by 'b'Melissa McCarthy'b', the comic actress and a surprise guest star, stole the show as \xe2\x80\x9cS.N.L.\xe2\x80\x9d continued to take swings at a president who delights in hitting back.'b'In the show\xe2\x80\x99s cold open, 'b'Alec Baldwin'b' returned for another outing as Mr. Trump, phoning up other world leaders under the guidance of chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon (actually an \xe2\x80\x9cS.N.L.\xe2\x80\x9d cast member dressed as the Grim Reaper). As Mr. Trump, Mr. Baldwin first called Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull of Australia (Beck Bennett), who reminded him that President Barack Obama promised to receive 1,200 refugees held in detention in Australia.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo refugees,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Baldwin said hastily. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica first, Australia sucks. Your reef is failing. Prepare to go to war.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He went on to call President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto of Mexico (\xe2\x80\x9cGuy who\xe2\x80\x99s going to pay for the wall says what?\xe2\x80\x9d), Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to write a memoir about this struggle, and call it \xe2\x80\x98My Struggle\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x93 what would that be in German?\xe2\x80\x9d) and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe.'b'Mr. Mugabe (Kenan Thompson) was not impressed or intimidated: \xe2\x80\x9cI will rip out your spine and drink from your skull,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Mr. Baldwin.'b'In her opening monologue, Ms. Stewart, the show\xe2\x80\x99s host, recalled a period in 2012 when Mr. Trump posted several tweets about the relationship she had with her \xe2\x80\x9cTwilight\xe2\x80\x9d co-star Robert Pattinson. (In 'b'one tweet Mr. Trump wrote'b' that Ms. Stewart \xe2\x80\x9ccheated on him like a dog &amp; will do it again,\xe2\x80\x9d and 'b'in another'b' he invited Mr. Pattinson to attend the Miss Universe pageant.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo be fair,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Stewart said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Donald Trump hated me. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s in love with my boyfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe president is not a huge fan of me. But that is so O.K. And Donald, if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t like me then, you\xe2\x80\x99re really probably not going to like me now. Because I\xe2\x80\x99m hosting S.N.L. and I\xe2\x80\x99m, like, so gay, dude.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, the night belonged to Ms. McCarthy, the star of \xe2\x80\x9cBridesmaids\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cGhostbusters,\xe2\x80\x9d who came out in thinning blond hair and an ill-fitting suit to play an aggressive, gum-chugging version of Mr. Spicer as he led a daily White House press briefing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know that myself and the press have gotten off to a rocky start,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, starting off the session. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I say rocky start, I mean it in the sense of \xe2\x80\x98Rocky,\xe2\x80\x99 the movie, because I came out here to punch you in the face. And also I don\xe2\x80\x99t talk so good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As Mr. Spicer, Ms. McCarthy then told the press corps she would be \xe2\x80\x9capologizing, on behalf of you, to me, for how you have treated me these last two weeks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that apology is not accepted,\xe2\x80\x9d she added.'b'Discussing Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s recent announcement that he would nominate Judge Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court, Ms. McCarthy said, \xe2\x80\x9cThe crowd greeted him with a standing ovation, which lasted a full 15 minutes. And you can check the tape on that. Everyone was smiling. Everyone was happy. The men all had erections, and every single one of the women was ovulating left and right. And no one, no one was sad. Those are the facts forever.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'An addled Ms. McCarthy then read her own email password, and tangled with a New York Times reporter (played by Bobby Moynihan) who asked why Mr. Trump did or did not use the word \xe2\x80\x9cban\xe2\x80\x9d when describing his executive order prohibiting travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou just said that,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s quoting you. It\xe2\x80\x99s your words. He\xe2\x80\x99s using your words, when you use the words and he uses them back, it\xe2\x80\x99s circular using of the word and that\xe2\x80\x99s from you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When a Wall Street Journal reporter simply asked, \xe2\x80\x9cAre you O.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. McCarthy charged at her with her podium and threatened, \xe2\x80\x9cI will put you in the corner with CNN.\xe2\x80\x9d (The screen then showed a CNN reporter in a cage.)'b'Mr. Trump has posted complaints and criticisms of \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d on his Twitter account over the past several months, though he has not weighed in on the show in the weeks since his 'b'inauguration'b'. (Nor, as of this writing, has Mr. Spicer.)'b'Mr. Baldwin, whose impression of Mr. Trump has often been a target of the president\xe2\x80\x99s ire, is scheduled to host \xe2\x80\x9cS.N.L.\xe2\x80\x9d next Saturday, Feb. 11.'b'The bad news had been building for months at the 'b'Metropolitan Museum of Art'b'.'b'Even as crowds poured into shows on 'b'Hellenistic kingdoms'b' and 'b'high-tech fashion'b', the Met\xe2\x80\x99s deficit was approaching $40 million and had forced the buyout or layoff of some 90 employees. An expansion into a satellite building cost millions of dollars more than expected. A new Met logo and marketing plan were rolled out at great expense \xe2\x80\x94 and greeted with ridicule. Then, last month, a new $600 million wing was postponed by several years, frustrating the Met\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to become a serious player in the competitive field of Modern and contemporary art.'b'Tension inside the Met, the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest art museum, is running so high that when curators and conservators recently wrote a letter protesting compensation cuts, the museum\xe2\x80\x99s leaders chose not to show it to trustees for fear of leaks and bad publicity. Those who wanted to see the document had to go to the office of the Met\xe2\x80\x99s general counsel and read it under observation.'b'After enjoying boom years, one of the most pre-eminent cultural institutions in the world is now struggling with missteps and the perils of overreaching at a time of uncertain resources. While many museums face financial and competitive pressures, the Met\xe2\x80\x99s troubles are magnified, given its stature on the world stage.'b'How can a behemoth like the Met, the thinking goes, possibly stumble? Some curators and trustees have zeroed in on Thomas P. Campbell, the Met\xe2\x80\x99s director and chief executive since 2008, as well as the board that has backed him. The anguish can be intense, given the love that all involved have for the Met.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tragedy to see a great institution in decline,\xe2\x80\x9d said George R. Goldner, who in 2014 retired after 21 years as the chairman of the Met\xe2\x80\x99s drawings and prints department and has since served as a consultant to the museum. \xe2\x80\x9cTo have inherited a museum as strong as the Met was 10 years ago \xe2\x80\x94 with a great curatorial staff \xe2\x80\x94 and to have it be what it is today is unimaginable.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Several people inside the museum, most of whom spoke anonymously for fear of losing their positions, said the Met under Mr. Campbell had tried to do too much too fast: overhiring in the digital department; overspending on an additional building, the Met Breuer, and on rebranding; overdrawing from unrestricted endowment funds to cover costs; emphasizing Modern and contemporary art at the expense of core departments; and pursuing the new wing before the financing was in place.'b'Instead, the Met should have been contracting, given falling revenue from its retail stores and admission fees and rising expenses.'b'At the same time, some hope that by reckoning with its troubles, the Met is poised to turn a corner.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re getting to the same page,\xe2\x80\x9d said Keith Christiansen, the chairman of the Met\xe2\x80\x99s European paintings department. \xe2\x80\x9cOne benefit from all this: It\xe2\x80\x99s brought the departments together with the administration to sit down at a common table, and that\xe2\x80\x99s something. Now what do we do to move forward and make sure the mission of the museum is not compromised?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Efforts to right the ship have been difficult and painful. In addition to staff cuts, curators were asked to curtail spending for shows and acquisitions. The Met stages nearly 60 exhibitions a year, far more than most museums, but now expects to reduce its exhibitions to about 40 a year.'b'Instead of moving forward with the architect David Chipperfield on a wing intended to help attract art and money from contemporary collectors, the Met has been forced to prioritize the replacement of its aging skylights and roof above the European paintings galleries.'b'In an interview, Mr. Campbell acknowledged that the museum had \xe2\x80\x9cbeen through a trying year.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy colleagues have every right to feel upset,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAt the same time, one has to step back and look at the success of the institution.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To be sure, most agree that the museum\xe2\x80\x99s expansive collections and ambitious exhibitions remain strong. The recent 'b'Kerry James Marshall'b' survey at the Met Breuer was widely judged a success, though some critics say the museum\xe2\x80\x99s first retrospective of a living black artist would have been even more momentous in the hallowed main building.'b'In addition, the museum\xe2\x80\x99s attendance has increased to about seven million visitors a year, including the Cloisters. The Breuer, which opened in March, has drawn 557,000 visitors, exceeding projections.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve got a whole Modern art collection in the Breuer we didn\xe2\x80\x99t have before,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hamilton E. James, a Met trustee. \xe2\x80\x9cAttendance is at all-time records; critical acclaim has never been as good. An awful lot of wonderful things have gone on.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Moreover, Met officials say, many cultural institutions have been grappling with a structural deficit \xe2\x80\x94 when costs exceed revenues, despite a strong economy. The Museum of Modern Art and the Brooklyn Museum, for example, also recently offered buyouts \xe2\x80\x94 though they did not then move to layoffs. The New York Philharmonic has delayed the tentative date for opening its $600 million rebuilt hall to get a better sense of its cost. And the Los Angeles County Museum of Art is struggling to raise nearly half the $600 million needed for its expansion.'b'While the Met charged Mr. Campbell with strengthening the museum\xe2\x80\x99s Modern and contemporary art activities, his focus on the Met Breuer and new wing has been controversial. Why try to compete with the new Whitney Museum of American Art and the Museum of Modern Art, some ask, instead of sticking to what the Met already does best?'b'Mr. Campbell said he had aimed \xe2\x80\x9cto sustain an environment in which scholarship could flourish and be the engine of our program, as well as to expand our audiences, to digitize the institution and to revisit what it is to be an encyclopedic museum.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve made remarkable progress, but these things are flexible, and they need modulation,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the same period, we have had to balance our expenditures and our income. In light of that, we\xe2\x80\x99re certainly doing some recalibration on the goals we\xe2\x80\x99ve set ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some critics say Mr. Campbell has been out of his depth \xe2\x80\x94 a tapestry curator thrust into the large shoes of the legendary Philippe de Montebello, with no experience running a major institution. (Mr. de Montebello did not have chief executive in his title until 22 years into his 31-year tenure as director.)'b'Moreover, Mr. Campbell, by many accounts, has handled the economic crisis by hunkering down in a defensive crouch rather than reaching out to unite the staff \xe2\x80\x94 and the full board \xe2\x80\x94 behind his efforts. Internal critics say he failed to appreciate the upheaval caused by the turnover of three-quarters of the curatorial leadership through departures and retirements. They describe the pervasive sense that institutional memory is going out the door and the fear that the Met\xe2\x80\x99s mission to educate through scholarship has been overshadowed by its desire to attract millennials through social media.'b'Mr. Campbell said internal relations was often a challenge at the Met, with its more than 2,200-member work force, and acknowledged that he could do better. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve tried very hard to open up communications \xe2\x80\x94 bringing people into briefings, in town hall meetings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say we\xe2\x80\x99ve got it right yet, but we\xe2\x80\x99re heading in the right direction.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI myself need to evolve my thinking and my interactions,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve identified those issues and taken steps to move forward in a very collective manner.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Boston Consulting Group, hired a year ago pro bono to help with the Met\xe2\x80\x99s restructuring, was asked this month to interview staff members and trustees about their concerns because the museum recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthat morale was challenged,\xe2\x80\x9d said Daniel H. Weiss, the Met\xe2\x80\x99s president and chief operating officer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s really important that people feel empowered to say what they think.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Mr. Weiss, formerly the president of Haverford College, came to the Met last year, he set out to cut $31 million from a $332 million annual budget. He said Mr. Campbell had been open to making the changes required.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have gone through a significant and difficult time,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Weiss said. \xe2\x80\x9cTom has been very supportive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Daniel Brodsky, the museum\xe2\x80\x99s chairman, said that Mr. Campbell and Mr. Weiss had taken appropriate steps toward financial stability and that he and his fellow trustees had not lost confidence in Mr. Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to lead.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTom is a very bright person, and the board supports him,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mr. James, the trustee, said many of the Met\xe2\x80\x99s struggles \xe2\x80\x9cwere beyond the control\xe2\x80\x9d of a chief executive. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get bumps in the road, and you have to deal with them.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe leadership team of Tom and Dan \xe2\x80\x94 I view it very much as a partnership,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cDan brings a discipline and a businesslike approach.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, the Met\xe2\x80\x99s current retrenchment inevitably looks like a repudiation of much of Mr. Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s original agenda. He has been forced to let go many of his key hires, and his timetable for the new wing has been disrupted.'b'The Breuer \xe2\x80\x94 the Whitney\xe2\x80\x99s former Madison Avenue home, where the Met has an eight-year lease \xe2\x80\x94 was to be a temporary hub for the museum\xe2\x80\x99s Modern and contemporary activities during construction, so the new wing could be unveiled in 2020, on the Met\xe2\x80\x99s 150th birthday. The wing is also a linchpin of Leonard A. Lauder\xe2\x80\x99s transformative 'b'gift of Cubist artworks'b', valued at more than $1 billion, which needs a worthy exhibition space.'b'But Mr. Campbell said he had not given up on his main goals to bolster contemporary art at the Met and broaden the audience in a technological age.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love the Met, I love the work I\xe2\x80\x99m doing here,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I\xe2\x80\x99m very committed to seeing all of these many projects through.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The complete list of winners:'b''b'Record of the Year'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Adele'b''b'Album of the Year'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9c25\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Adele 'b'(read our 'b'review'b')'b''b''b'Song of the Year'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cHello\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Adele Adkins &amp;

Brian Grazer, Ron Howard, Scott Pascucci &amp; Nigel Sinclair, video producers'b''b'Al Jarreau'b', a versatile vocalist who sold millions of records and won a string of Grammys for his work in pop and R&amp;B as well as his first love, jazz, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. He was 76.'b'His death was announced by his manager, Joe Gordon, who said that Mr. Jarreau had been hospitalized for exhaustion two weeks ago. On the advice of his doctors, he had canceled his tour dates and retired from touring.'b'Mr. Jarreau did not begin a full-time musical career until he was nearly 30, but within a few years he had begun attracting notice for a vocal style that was both instantly appealing and highly unusual. Critics were particularly taken by his improvisational dexterity, in particular his virtuosic ability to produce an array of vocalizations ranging from delicious nonsense to clicks and growls to quasi-instrumental sounds.'b'Although he made his initial mark in the jazz world, Mr. Jarreau\xe2\x80\x99s style, and his audience, crossed stylistic barriers. His music incorporated elements of pop, soul, gospel, Latin and other genres. It was a mark of his eclecticism that he won six Grammys across three different categories: jazz, pop and R&amp;B. He was also among the performers on a Grammy-winning children\xe2\x80\x99s album, \xe2\x80\x9cIn Harmony: A Sesame Street Record.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If Mr. Jarreau\xe2\x80\x99s highly accessible, intensely personal style defied easy classification, that very accessibility \xe2\x80\x94 and, perhaps, the mere fact of his considerable commercial success \xe2\x80\x94 left some jazz purists skeptical.'b'Reviewing a concert by Mr. Jarreau at the Savoy in New York in 1981, Stephen Holden of The New York Times encapsulated what many saw as both the pros and the cons of Mr. Jarreau\xe2\x80\x99s singular style:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAl Jarreau may be the most technically gifted singer working in jazz-fusion today,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Holden wrote. Of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s performance, however, he continued: \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Jarreau\xe2\x80\x99s concert lacked the emotional range of great jazz. He is such a prodigious talent that the absence of even the slightest blues inflections kept his music from cutting deeply.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But critics\xe2\x80\x99 reservations never deterred Mr. Jarreau, who prided himself, as he told The Los Angeles Times in 1986, on his \xe2\x80\x9cjazz attitude,\xe2\x80\x9d which he defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe idea of being open to each and every moment as a chance to create something different.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI try to be receptive,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cand to be listening, and to not be afraid to try something new.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Alwin Lopez Jarreau was born in Milwaukee on March 12, 1940, into a musical family. His father, a minister, was a fine singer; his mother played the piano in church. Young Al began singing at 4, harmonizing with his siblings. As a youth he sang in church, as well as with street-corner harmony groups and local jazz bands.'b'Mr. Jarreau earned a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in psychology from Ripon College in Wisconsin in 1962, and a master\xe2\x80\x99s in vocational rehabilitation from the University of Iowa in 1964. Afterward he moved to San Francisco, where he worked as a rehabilitation counselor for people with disabilities.'b'But Mr. Jarreau found he could not resist the pull of jazz and before long was singing in local nightclubs. By the late \xe2\x80\x9960s, he had quit his day job and embarked on a nightclub career, first on the West Coast and eventually in New York.'b'He reached a national audience with the album \xe2\x80\x9cWe Got By,\xe2\x80\x9d released by Warner Bros. in 1975 to critical praise and commercial success.'b'Though advertised as his debut, it was actually his second album. A decade earlier, Mr. Jarreau had quietly recorded an album, later released on the Bainbridge label under the title \xe2\x80\x9c1965.\xe2\x80\x9d Though Mr. Jarreau took legal action, without success, to block its belated release in 1982, it is esteemed by jazz connoisseurs today.'b'Appearances on 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'and other television shows raised his profile, as did extensive touring. In 1981 he had his biggest hit with the song \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in This Love Together,\xe2\x80\x9d which reached No. 15 on the Billboard pop singles chart.'b'He won his first Grammy in 1978, for best jazz vocal performance, for his album \xe2\x80\x9cLook to the Rainbow.\xe2\x80\x9d He won his last in 2007, for best traditional R&amp;B vocal performance; the award was shared by Mr. Jarreau, George Benson and Jill Scott for their collaborative performance \xe2\x80\x9c'b'God Bless the Child'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In between, in 1982, Mr. Jarreau earned a Grammy for best pop vocal performance by a male artist for the title track of his album \xe2\x80\x9cBreakin\xe2\x80\x99 Away.\xe2\x80\x9d That year, he also received the Grammy for best jazz vocal performance by a male artist, for his version of Dave Brubeck\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Blue Rondo \xc3\xa0 la Turk'b',\xe2\x80\x9d from the same album.'b'His other Grammys came in 1979 for the album \xe2\x80\x9cAll Fly Home\xe2\x80\x9d (in the jazz category), and in 1993 for the album \xe2\x80\x9cHeaven and Earth\xe2\x80\x9d (in R&amp;B). A seventh Grammy came in 1981 for \xe2\x80\x9cIn Harmony: A Sesame Street Record,\xe2\x80\x9d a compilation children\xe2\x80\x99s album that featured a range of artists.'b'Among Mr. Jarreau\xe2\x80\x99s best-known recordings was the theme song for the long-running television series 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMoonlighting,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'for which he wrote the lyrics to Lee Holdridge\xe2\x80\x99s music. He appeared on Broadway as a replacement in the role of the Teen Angel in the 1994 revival of \xe2\x80\x9cGrease.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Jarreau\xe2\x80\x99s first marriage, to Phyllis Hall, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, the former Susan Player; a son, Ryan; two brothers, Marshall and Appie; and a sister, Rose Marie Freeman.'b'Mr. Jarreau canceled a number of concert dates in 2010 after experiencing heart and breathing problems during a European tour. He was hospitalized for 11 days but resumed his touring schedule after his release, and had continued to perform until recently.'b'Shortly after his 2010 hospitalization, he said in an interview that his health problems had not been as serious as reports suggested, but joked that he appreciated the attention they received in the media because it proved that he was a celebrity. \xe2\x80\x9cI figured,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98Yeah, maybe I have arrived.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'If you were disappointed that Bill Maher brought Milo Yiannopoulos onto his HBO show \xe2\x80\x9cReal Time\xe2\x80\x9d last week, Mr. Maher is not especially bothered.'b'In a telephone interview on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher batted back criticism of the booking by arguing that the appearance of Mr. Yiannopoulos actually helped expose the incendiary right-wing personality\xe2\x80\x99s views to a wider audience and hasten his sudden downfall.'b'Mr. Yiannopoulos\xe2\x80\x99s collapse was set in motion Sunday when a conservative group called the Reagan Battalion resurfaced a 2016 interview in which he endorsed sexual relations with boys as young as 13. Mr. Yiannopoulos \xe2\x80\x94 known for a history of offensive remarks about Muslims, Jews, transgender people and other groups, and as a ringleader in 'b'a notorious incident'b' of online harassment \xe2\x80\x94 'b'lost a speaking slot'b' at the Conservative Political Action Conference and a book deal with Simon &amp; Schuster, and then 'b'said on Tuesday'b' that he was resigning as a senior editor from Breitbart News.'b'Mr. Maher has been dealing for days with the fallout from 'b'his booking of 'b''b' Mr. Yiannopoulos'b'. The journalist Jeremy Scahill, who had been scheduled to appear on the same episode, 'b'withdrew from the show'b'. Mr. Maher has defended the booking on free-speech grounds, saying last week that if Mr. Yiannopoulos was indeed a monster, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing could serve the liberal cause better than having him exposed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But following the show, Mr. Maher 'b'came under attack'b' for the 'b'chummy and conciliatory vibe'b' of his conversation with Mr. Yiannopoulos and for a panel segment, 'b'broadcast online'b', in which his guest made more inflammatory remarks that seemed to go unchallenged.'b'Speaking on Tuesday night, Mr. Maher, who counts himself as a liberal, did not sound particularly chastened by these assessments. He said he knew his interview with Mr. Yiannopoulos would never be satisfactory to some viewers. \xe2\x80\x9cNo matter what I did,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit was never going to be enough for that slice of liberalism that would much rather judge a friend than engage an enemy, because it\xe2\x80\x99s easier.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Maher spoke further about the experience of having Mr. Yiannopoulos on \xe2\x80\x9cReal Time\xe2\x80\x9d and its aftermath, and why he will continue to seek out provocative conservative guests. These are edited excerpts from that conversation.'b''b'Given all that has transpired since Friday\xe2\x80\x99s show, how do you feel now about your decision to have Milo Yiannopoulos as a guest, and how those segments transpired?'b''b'Well, let\xe2\x80\x99s recap. About a week ago, I went on Van Jones\xe2\x80\x99s show, and somebody asked me about the booking. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t really gotten into the details of Milo yet. He was just getting on my radar. I said, specifically, sunlight is the best disinfectant. Then we had Milo on, despite the fact that many people said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh, how dare you give a platform to this man.\xe2\x80\x9d What I think people saw was an emotionally needy Ann Coulter wannabe, trying to make a buck off of the left\xe2\x80\x99s propensity for outrage. And by the end of the weekend, by dinnertime Monday, he\xe2\x80\x99s dropped as a speaker at CPAC. Then he\xe2\x80\x99s dropped by Breitbart, and his book deal falls through. As I say, sunlight is the best disinfectant. You\xe2\x80\x99re welcome.'b''b'You think his appearance on \xe2\x80\x9cReal Time\xe2\x80\x9d helped lead to his downfall?'b''b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was just saying. And by the way, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t trying to get him removed from society. I\xe2\x80\x99m somebody who, many times, people have tried to make go away. They were successful that one time, for six months in 23 years, because that\xe2\x80\x99s how long it was between the two shows [\xe2\x80\x9cReal Time\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cPolitically Incorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Maher\xe2\x80\x99s previous talk show, which aired on Comedy Central and ABC]. It just rubs me the wrong way when somebody says, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like what this person is saying \xe2\x80\x94 he should go away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Do you feel that way even about the kinds of things Milo was saying on your show, or in the other platforms he was given?'b''b'Can he do damage? I suppose he can. To a degree. Not a great degree, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think. Could he offend people? Could he even inspire a borderline person to do something violent? I guess so. But nothing is free in life. People seem to want to live in this world where everything is a win-win. That\xe2\x80\x99s not how life works.'b''b'Could there have been more accountability in your segments with him? For instance, it seemed like he was allowed to grossly understate his role in harassing Leslie Jones on Twitter. 'b''b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not my job to hold him accountable to everything he\xe2\x80\x99s ever said or done. I had eight minutes with him, on the show itself. Sorry I don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to go over everything everybody else would want to do. We just had time to, sort of, start a discussion of the broad view of who he is. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he frankly knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s going to say half the time, or knows what his philosophy is. But to see him as this monster is a little crazy. You know what he is? He\xe2\x80\x99s the little impish, bratty kid brother. And the liberals are his older teenager sisters who are having a sleepover and he puts a spider in their sleeping bag so he can watch them scream.'b''b'So how does someone deal with a personality like Milo, who is going much, much further than other guests, saying things that are demonstrably false?'b''b'The president says 10 things a day that are provably wrong. If I threw everyone off my show who says things that are provably wrong, I\xe2\x80\x99d never book a conservative and probably half the liberals.'b''b'When he said that transgender people have a \xe2\x80\x9cpsychiatric disorder,\xe2\x80\x9d do you just move on from that?'b''b'Move on? It dominated the entire [online] segment. The other guests attacked him. When I say, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d [to not want to share a bathroom with a transgender person] it\xe2\x80\x99s because women have said that to me: \xe2\x80\x9cI want to know,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not comfortable with someone in the bathroom, even if they, in their minds, have decided they are a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t that opinion count at all?'b''b'But you don\xe2\x80\x99t agree that transgender people have a psychiatric disorder. 'b''b'No, I don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with that. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know that much about the situation. If somebody feels like they\xe2\x80\x99re a woman, fine, then you\xe2\x80\x99re a woman. I\xe2\x80\x99m O.K. with that. If they\xe2\x80\x99ve studied that, and they say it\xe2\x80\x99s not a psychiatric disorder, I\xe2\x80\x99m O.K. with that too. If that\xe2\x80\x99s what scientists decided, that it\xe2\x80\x99s not any psychological disorder, it\xe2\x80\x99s fine with me. I agree.'b''b'Since the start of your new season, you have had other guests like Tomi Lahren and Piers Morgan \xe2\x80\x94 not nearly as provocative, but with whom liberal viewers aren\xe2\x80\x99t likely to agree. Are you trying to create conflict on your panels, or rile up your audience?'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve never tried to push anybody\xe2\x80\x99s buttons. I think everybody else in TV \xe2\x80\x94 everybody else who does political commentary in a comedic way \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re all in one box. It\xe2\x80\x99s so predictable, what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to do, which is, never say anything that would make anything \xe2\x80\x94 that would make any liberal give the slightest bit of discomfort. I do a show about what\xe2\x80\x99s happening that week in the news. Trump is president. I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that we have enough credibility with both sides, that people who are Trump supporters will still do the show.'b''b'Going back to \xe2\x80\x9cPolitically Incorrect,\xe2\x80\x9d you booked conservatives like Ann Coulter and Kellyanne Conway \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94'b''b'And Laura Ingraham. We had a whole cadre of blond conservatives. There was a fourth woman conservative we used to book in those days, who we kind of discovered \xe2\x80\x94 her name was Arianna Huffington.'b''b'Even after your experience with Milo, do you still want to have guests your viewers haven\xe2\x80\x99t encountered or might want to avoid?'b''b'Yes. I like people who push the limits. I like people who are not afraid to take the slings and arrows, because they\xe2\x80\x99re going to explore what\xe2\x80\x99s on the edge. Now, is this guy over the edge? Yes. I mean, he\xe2\x80\x99s a little cuckoo. But I would rather err on that side than on the side where everybody else is.'b'PASADENA, Calif. \xe2\x80\x94 Fifty years ago next month, CBS broadcast \xe2\x80\x9cThe Homosexuals,\xe2\x80\x9d an unsettling 'b'documentary'b' about a subject \xe2\x80\x9cthat people find disturbing,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mike Wallace, the anchor, put it. For nearly an hour, viewers saw a gay man in shadows describing the tragedy of his life, psychiatrists who depicted homosexuality as a debilitating mental illness and a harrowing clip of a distraught 19-year-old soldier being driven to jail after his arrest on a charge of soliciting sex in a public restroom.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe average homosexual \xe2\x80\x94 if there be such \xe2\x80\x94 is promiscuous,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Wallace told his audience. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is not interested in, nor capable of, a lasting relationship like that of a heterosexual marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A more contemporary examination of gay life in America comes to network television later this month, in an eight-hour avalanche of prime time spread across four nights, and with a decidedly different take on the subject. Written by a prominent gay filmmaker, Dustin Lance Black, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise\xe2\x80\x9d is a 50-year history of the gay rights movement beginning on Feb. 27, told through four characters who suffer \xe2\x80\x94 and often triumph over \xe2\x80\x94 family rejection, landlord discrimination, gay-bashing, police harassment, legislative defeats and AIDS.'b'But the world is a different place than it was when ABC first commissioned the project four years ago. Barack Obama was in the White House, and gay leaders were celebrating a series of court and statehouse victories, which would soon include the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognizing a constitutional right to marry by same-sex couples. After President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s election, questions that seemed largely settled about gays in American society \xe2\x80\x94 'b'same-sex marriage'b', equal treatment in the workplace and in housing \xe2\x80\x94 suddenly seem in doubt.'b'Mr. Trump is hardly a champion of gay rights, and Mike Pence, his vice president, has a record of explicit opposition to gay rights measures. Mr. Trump could well end up altering the ideological composition of the Supreme Court that handed down the marriage decision.'b'Still, as celebration has given way to intense anxiety, Mr. Black argues that the election\xe2\x80\x99s outcome has made the mini-series even more urgent.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not create this series for half a nation,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Black said. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe that most Americans, including Americans who voted for Donald Trump, will fall in love with these real-life families and absolutely relate to their stories when they tune in.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There have been no shortage of gay characters and gay-themed television shows and films in recent years, be it \xe2\x80\x9cQueer as Folk,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cModern Family\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cWill &amp; Grace.\xe2\x80\x9d And ABC was the network that showed what was at the time a groundbreaking gay-themed television movie, \xe2\x80\x9c'b'That Certain Summer,'b'\xe2\x80\x9d in 1972. But there has never been anything quite as sprawling or historical devoted to this particular topic, a project that is drawing comparisons to \xe2\x80\x9cRoots,\xe2\x80\x9d the 1977 ABC mini-series that traced the history of African-American slavery.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve reached the stage in the L.G.B.T. movement when a network not only feels comfortable taking this on \xe2\x80\x94 but doing so in a big way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eric Marcus, a gay historian who produces the 'b'Making Gay History podcast'b' and is preparing his own multipart documentary on the movement.'b''b'Torie Osborn'b', a longtime gay and lesbian rights leader who was active in San Francisco during struggles depicted in the movie, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope this is a moment for our allies to learn about our history and young gay men and lesbians to learn about their history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a story that could have been told before,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, adding: \xe2\x80\x9cBetter late than never.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Sipping a cup of tea after flying in from his home in London, Mr. Black, 42, teared up here as he recounted learning that ABC would devote a four-night block of prime time to his work. (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise\xe2\x80\x9d originally was set for four consecutive nights; the second episode has now been delayed a day to make way, fittingly enough, for Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first State of the Union address.)'b'It was a far cry from the struggle he endured to get a movie made of his screenplay for \xe2\x80\x9cMilk,\xe2\x80\x9d the story of Harvey Milk, the openly gay member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors who was assassinated in 1978. Mr. Black said that he went nearly broke financing it and that a studio committed to it only after Sean Penn had signed on to play the title character. Mr. Black won an Academy Award for best original screenplay.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise\xe2\x80\x9d is the latest in a series of works by Mr. Black focusing on gay issues. He wrote \xe2\x80\x9c8,\xe2\x80\x9d a play based on the closing arguments over the constitutionality of a voter initiative in California in 2008 prohibiting the marriage of same-sex couples. The production of the play was used to raise money for the legal battle that resulted in the initiative\xe2\x80\x99s being thrown out of court.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cListen, if I wanted to write movies about people with capes and fangs, I could,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy good, military, conservative, Mormon mother always said, \xe2\x80\x98Wake up every morning and make the world better.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s what I was trying to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Still, telling that story was hardly easy. The history of the gay and lesbian movement is diffuse and complicated, with endless debates over 'b'where and when it really began'b', who its leaders are and, most fundamentally, what the battle was \xe2\x80\x94 is \xe2\x80\x94 about. Its center of gravity bounced across the country. There are few, if any, people who have risen to define the movement: Figures tend to appear and recede to the sidelines, because of death or the challenges of leading a fractious group of what was, at least initially, outcasts.'b'This has long presented a challenge for anyone seeking a neat narrative arc for this history. \xe2\x80\x9cBy necessity if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to tell the story of the L.G.B.T. civil rights movement, you are only going to be able to tell a slice of a slice of a slice,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Marcus said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat invariably happens is there will be people screaming that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell the whole story. Well, it can\xe2\x80\x99t tell the whole story.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Black focuses largely on San Francisco \xe2\x80\x94 familiar ground, since that was where \xe2\x80\x9cMilk\xe2\x80\x9d was based. But other cities were arguably as politically significant \xe2\x80\x94 New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Washington and Minneapolis among them \xe2\x80\x94 and are largely absent from this account.'b'The four characters who form the frame of Mr. Black\xe2\x80\x99s story may not be the four most important figures in the movement. They were chosen over (just to pluck a few names at random from a very long list) leaders like 'b'Arthur Evans'b', a founder of the Gay Activists Alliance in New York; Virginia Apuzzo, a former nun and early leader of the National Gay and Lesbian Rights Task Force; 'b'Steve Endean'b', a founder of the Human Rights Campaign Fund; Barbara Gittings, a founder of the Daughters of Bilitis in New York City; and 'b'Morris Kight'b', who fought in the trenches of Los Angeles for close to 25 years.'b'But Mr. Black needed characters whose lives spanned the contours of this history, who would give continuity to a long story and who are, in three cases, played by different actors at different stages of their lives.'b'Central among them is Cleve Jones. He worked for Mr. Milk when he was a county supervisor, was there the day he was assassinated and went on to become a founder of the 'b'Names Project AIDS Memorial Quilt'b', an emotionally wrenching commemoration of the people lost to the epidemic, in 1985. Mr. Jones, a historical consultant to this mini-series, stayed in Mr. Black\xe2\x80\x99s home in the Hollywood Hills while writing his own memoir, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise: My Life in the Movement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Jones, who is played as an adult by Guy Pearce, said that while some details in the production were not true to what he experienced, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise\xe2\x80\x9d captured the spirit and themes of the movement that has absorbed much of his life. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could be truthful without being accurate,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise\xe2\x80\x9d grapples with some of the more difficult chapters of the movement, including the tense relationship between men and women in the early days, and later, how lesbians stepped up to help gay men deal with the health and political ramifications of the AIDS epidemic. Part of that is told through 'b'Roma Guy'b', an early feminist leader in San Francisco, played by Mary-Louise Parker. And it does not avoid the racial discrimination common in gay male bars in the 1970 and 1980s, told through the story of an African-American community organizer in the Bay Area, Ken Jones, played as an adult by Michael K. Williams ('b'Omar'b', of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Wire\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'As the production moves into the 1990s and turns to the Clinton White House and its mixed record on gay issues, a fascinating story within a story emerges involving 'b'Richard Socarides'b', who was President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s gay liaison: He is played by his younger brother, the actor Charles Socarides.'b'And their father is 'b'Charles W. Socarides'b', a psychiatrist who was one of the most vocal proponents of the view that homosexuality was a pathological disorder. Dr. Socarides is an expert witness, as it were, both in \xe2\x80\x9cWhen We Rise\xe2\x80\x9d and in the CBS documentary of 1967.'b'The fraught relationship between Dr. Socarides and his gay son has been the subject of several articles (including one I wrote in October 1995 for Out Magazine). But Mr. Socarides said there are details about his coming out to his father that he decided to share for the first time with Mr. Black.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn that interaction with my father, my father takes out a gun and puts it to his head and threatens to shoot himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Socarides said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhich actually happened. No one ever knew about it. It was really intense. I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t told anybody that ever, because I was trying to protect him, or I guess in some way I was embarrassed or ashamed of myself. I felt enough time had passed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The tussles President Clinton had with gay leaders \xe2\x80\x94 in particular, over his support of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as being between a man and a woman \xe2\x80\x94 seem tame in this political environment, where gay leaders are girding for Mr. Trump, and Republicans who control state legislatures, to roll back protections for gays and lesbians. Still, this new climate does not appear to have shaken ABC.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat doesn\xe2\x80\x99t change things for us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Channing Dungey, the president of ABC Entertainment. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a true story involving actual events, involving real people. We are not coming at this from a political place or trying to make a political statement. This feels like an emotional story that we just want to share.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Black said that if he had learned anything from this work, it is that the gay rights movement is a story of triumphs followed by setbacks. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s election, he said, is just another turn in this road.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are in a period of backlash right now,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI would give anything for this to be less topical. But this series shows our history is a pendulum, not a straight line.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'New York\xe2\x80\x99s Outsider Art Fair, which opened Thursday, is celebrating its 25th anniversary. It made its debut in 1993 in the 19th-century Puck Building in SoHo\xe2\x80\x99s northeast corner.'b'I saw the first iteration, reviewed the second and wrote about it many times after that. I enjoy most art fairs for their marathon-like density of visual experience and information, but the Outsider fair quickly became my favorite. It helped make art big again.'b'The focus of the fair, according to its founder, Sanford L. Smith, known as Sandy, was the work of outsider artists, a catchall phrase for many kinds of self-taught creators. (Mr. Smith credited the phrase to Roger Cardinal, the art historian and author of 'b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Outsider Art,\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1972.) Outsider work connoted a certain purity \xe2\x80\x94 an unstoppable need to make art that was unsullied by the \xe2\x80\x9cinsider\xe2\x80\x9d art world, with its fine-art degrees and commercial machinations that always struck me as rather hoity-toity.'b'Distinct from folk artists who usually evolved within familiar conventions, outsider artists often worked without precedent in relative isolation. They could be developmentally disabled, visionary, institutionalized, reclusive or simply retirees whose hobbies developed an unexpected intensity and originality. The term has long been the subject of debate, and its meaning has become elastic and inclusive. But however the category was, or is, defined, the Outsider Art Fair, compared with other fairs, seemed the least pretentious, the least focused on money, the rawest, liveliest and most full of surprises.'b'It was often extraordinarily uneven, yet it proved that just beyond the borders of the professional art world there lived a parallel universe of art-making, every bit as good as the (also uneven) insider one. And so much wilder and more diverse in every way.'b'Year after year, the Outsider Art Fair hammered this point home, usually quite effectively, and on increasingly global terms. It played a crucial role in changing the shape of modern and contemporary art. Each successive version confirmed the status of the self-taught masters, some only recently discovered, or rediscovered: Adolf W\xc3\xb6lfli, who died in 1930; Bill Traylor, in 1949; and Mart\xc3\xadn Ram\xc3\xadrez, Joseph Yoakum and Henry Darger, who worked into the 1960s and \xe2\x80\x9970s. The fair exposed their work to a wider audience, while insinuating an alternate 20th-century canon.'b'It is almost shocking to recall that the achievement of the great 'b'Morton Bartlett'b' (1909-1992) was unveiled at the first 1993 fair by the dealer 'b'Marion Harris'b', who had acquired his work after his death. Harvard-educated, Bartlett was a freelance photographer and graphic designer who, between 1936 and 1963, devoted his leisure time to making and photographing anatomically correct half-size prepubescent girls (and the occasional boy) and their wardrobes. His work was as calm as it was obsessive, as perverse as it was innocent. It fit almost seamlessly into a history of insider setup photography that extended at least from 'b'Claude Cahun'b' and 'b'Hans Bellmer'b' to 'b'Cindy Sherman'b', 'b'Laurie Simmons'b' and 'b'James Casebere'b'.'b'Bartlett vaulted instantly into the outsider pantheon, while disturbing the insider-outsider division. As did 'b'James Castle'b' (1899-1977), introduced at the 1997 fair by the J Crist Gallery of Boise, Idaho. Born deaf and mute, Castle spent much of his life memorializing his family\xe2\x80\x99s Idaho farm, the interiors and exteriors of its buildings, its surrounding fields. His drawings, sculpture and books were usually made with a combination of cardboard, string and a mixture of soot and saliva to resemble charcoal. They often suggested Vuillard at home on the range and also the quiet, inward art of Jasper Johns.'b'The list of artists whose work received first or early exposure at the fair is staggering and continues to grow. Some of the better-known names include the developmentally disabled sculptor 'b'Judith Scott'b' (1943-2005), whose wrapped-yarn assemblages were shown at the fair by 'b'Ricco-Maresca 'b'Gallery in 2001 and given a retrospective at the Brooklyn Museum in 2014; the Nebraska farmer 'b'Emery Blagdon'b' in 2004 \xe2\x80\x94 who until his death at 78, in 1986, created wire-metal scrap sculptures and environments that he saw as healing machines, not art; and 'b'Melvin Way'b', shown by Margaret Bodell, also in 2004: a mentally disturbed, homeless New Yorker whose small felt-tip drawings embedded mysterious equations in areas of darkness, evoking higher math pulsing through the night sky.'b'There were also 'b'Ionel Talpazan'b'\xe2\x80\x99s radiant spaceships and galaxies, the result, he said, of U.F.O. encounters as a child in Romania, before he came to New York. You could see his work in the fair at 'b'American Primitive'b' Gallery in the late 1990s, and when you staggered out into the January cold, Talpazan, who died at 60 in 2015, would often be there, on the sidewalk, selling pieces.'b'As part of the fair\xe2\x80\x99s current anniversary celebration, the historian and critic Edward M. G\xc3\xb3mez has organized an exhibition of 25 works that offers an object-oriented timeline: Each work appeared in one of the fair\xe2\x80\x99s 25 iterations.'b'Entering the fair on opening night had its rituals: getting through the line at the door, past the coat check and into the relative warmth where the Puck\xe2\x80\x99s high ceilings, lustrous dark-wood floors and eccentric layout seemed perfect. Until her retirement in 2009, 'b'Phyllis Kind'b' occupied the first booth. Arguably the doyenne of American outsider art dealers, she had galleries in Chicago and New York. In the early 1970s, she mounted the first solo show in a commercial gallery of Ram\xc3\xadrez\xe2\x80\x99s work, soon after it was rediscovered by the artist Jim Nutt (whom she then represented). A few years later, she introduced Darger, the Chicago recluse whose illustrated epic of the battling Vivian Girls emerged only after his death in 1973.'b'Sharp of mind, eye and tongue, Ms. Kind was a formidable, stimulating presence. You could talk to her for days about art, and her booth was always full of great stuff. And yet I viewed her with a certain ambivalence in this setting. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t wait to get to the rest of the fair, to skim, following my eye to see, and perhaps ask about, the next newly discovered artist.'b'I know the annual humbling of the Outsider Art Fair changed me, making me more open, less tolerant of rules and orthodoxies, more understanding of the human urgency to make art and how widespread it is. I also think it changed the art world, expanding it and in the process rendering the outsider phrase all but obsolete. It seems so 20th century now to choose one side and look down on the other. Now the art world is full of galleries that represent both; those in the 2017 fair include Nicelle Beauchene, Jack Hanley, Shrine and Y Gallery, all from the Lower East Side. A result of the closeness is that contemporary art feels more free than it has in decades.'b'In some ways outsider art was the antidote to the stringencies and anti-object attitudes of Conceptual Art, which like outsider art began to gain critical mass in the 1970s. It might also be seen as finishing the job of recomplicating and rematerializing art that began in the 1980s, especially with Neo-Expressionist painting.'b'Of course, the fair did not act alone. Many curators did their bit, including Lawrence Rinder, who introduced the great quiltmaker 'b'Rosie Lee Tompkins'b' (1936-2006) at the Berkeley Art Museum; Matthew Higgs, who as director of White Columns, has regularly featured solo shows of outsiders including Judith Scott; and Lynne Cooke, who mounted an exhibition of the Ivory Coast artist 'b'Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric Bruly Bouabr\xc3\xa9'b' at the Dia Art Foundation in 1994.'b'It is a measure of the speed with which these artists have reshaped the contemporary art world that in late 1993, the New Museum collaborated with the Museum of American Folk Art (now the American Folk Art Museum) on a large retrospective of 'b'Thornton Dial'b', the Alabama creator of haunted, gnarly relief paintings. Only 20 years later \xe2\x80\x9cThe Encyclopedic Palace\xe2\x80\x9d delivered a sprawling mixture of insiders and outsiders at the 2013 Venice Biennale. It was organized by Massimiliano Gioni, artistic director of the New Museum.'b'The art world\xe2\x80\x99s fluctuating attention to folk and then outsider art forms a complex history that runs throughout the 20th century, with each generation producing its advocates and institutions worldwide. In New York, both the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art, opened in 1929 and 1931, collected folk art at first and then stopped, deaccessioning many of their holdings. Now they are back, in a way, collecting so-called outsider art. The Outsider Art Fair has contributed to this immeasurably meaningful sea change.'b'President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order banning travel and rescinding visas for citizens of seven majority-Muslim nations does not lack for opponents in New York \xe2\x80\x94 from Kennedy Airport, where striking taxi drivers joined thousands of demonstrators, to the United Nations, whose new secretary general, Ant\xc3\xb3nio Guterres, said the measures \xe2\x80\x9c'b'violate our basic principles.'b'\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Now the Museum of Modern Art \xe2\x80\x94 which in past decades has cultivated a templelike detachment \xe2\x80\x94 is making its voice heard as well. In one of the strongest protests yet by a major cultural institution, the museum has reconfigured its fifth-floor permanent-collection galleries \xe2\x80\x94 interrupting its narrative of Western Modernism, from C\xc3\xa9zanne through World War II \xe2\x80\x94 to showcase contemporary art from Iran, Iraq and Sudan, whose citizens are subject to the ban. A Picasso came down. Matisse, down. Ensor, Boccioni, Picabia, Burri: They made way for artists who, if they are alive and abroad, cannot see their work in the museum\xe2\x80\x99s most august galleries. (A work from a Syrian artist has been added to the film program. The other affected countries are Somalia, Yemen and Libya.)'b'The works will be up for several months, and alongside each painting, sculpture, or photograph is a text that makes no bones about why it has suddenly surfaced: \xe2\x80\x9cThis work is by an artist from a nation whose citizens are being denied entry into the United States, according to a presidential executive order issued on January 27, 2017. This is one of several such artworks from the Museum\xe2\x80\x99s collection installed throughout the fifth-floor galleries to affirm the ideals of welcome and freedom as vital to this Museum, as they are to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On Thursday night I observed three curators \xe2\x80\x94 Christophe Cherix, head of the department of prints and drawings; Jodi Hauptman, a senior curator in that department; and Paulina Pobocha, an assistant curator in the department of painting and sculpture \xe2\x80\x94 mulling which works from a rolling dolly to include and, no less challenging, what to remove.'b'In the recently redesigned Picasso gallery, that Spanish artist\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCard Player\xe2\x80\x9d of 1913-14 has been replaced by \xe2\x80\x9c'b'The Mosque'b',\xe2\x80\x9d a small oil painting from 1964 by the Sudanese artist 'b'Ibrahim el-Salahi'b'. Mr. Salahi freely interweaves Modernist abstraction, Arabic calligraphy and architectural motifs. There\xe2\x80\x99s a tonal rhyme between the burnished browns of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Mosque\xe2\x80\x9d and the mucky beige and mushroom pigments of Picasso\xe2\x80\x99s analytical Cubist tableaus \xe2\x80\x94 and Picasso\xe2\x80\x99s own deep debt to African art is further underlined by his new company.'b'The Matisse gallery, where the masterworks \xe2\x80\x9cDance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Piano Lesson\xe2\x80\x9d hang, has been refitted with a large, intricate work on paper by the Iranian artist Charles Hossein Zenderoudi. In his \xe2\x80\x9cMon P\xc3\xa8re et Moi\xe2\x80\x9d (1962), stylized gold hands and feet accompany jam-packed squares containing concentric circles and dancing glyphs. Are the two figures performing sujud, the act of prostrating oneself during Muslim prayer? They are too abstract to say with certainty. Like Matisse, Mr. Zenderoudi translated bodies into pure shapes, informed by patterns gleaned from the decorative arts.'b''b'An untitled canvas covered in dried, cracked earth'b', by Marcos Grigorian, who grew up in Iran, now hangs amid similarly geological works by Alberto Burri and Antoni T\xc3\xa0pies. The gallery devoted to futurism has 'b'a small bronze totem by Parviz Tanavoli'b', one of Iran\xe2\x80\x99s foremost sculptors. (Mr. Tanavoli, who divides his time between Iran and Canada, was 'b'briefly detained last year'b' by Iranian authorities.) Now, next to Henri Rousseau\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sleeping Gypsy\xe2\x80\x9d is 'b'a painting by Zaha Hadid'b', the Iraqi-born British architect who died last year.'b'Hadid\xe2\x80\x99s depiction of Hong Kong as an allover composition of interlocking shards satisfyingly fractures the gallery\xe2\x80\x99s timeline of art around 1900, and other works, too, are installed almost as intentional disruptions.'b''b'A massive 2011 photograph'b' of three billiard balls by Shirana Shahbazi \xe2\x80\x94 who has German citizenship but whose Iranian birth means she is now barred from this country \xe2\x80\x94 incongruously dominates the gallery devoted to Dada, right behind \xe2\x80\x9cTo Be Looked At \xe2\x80\xa6,\xe2\x80\x9d Marcel Duchamp\xe2\x80\x99s impish painting on glass. Next to a large, Expressionist street scene by Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, a'b' 2007 video, \xe2\x80\x9cChit Chat,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' by Tala Madani, who was born in Iran, plays on a loop. The frames of the stop-motion animation derive from bold, brushy compositions Ms. Madani paints and repaints. But where Kirchner depicts the streets of Dresden with a certain alienated distance, the video \xe2\x80\x94 depicting men grabbing each other by the throat and vomiting up yellow paint \xe2\x80\x94 is quietly urgent.'b'America\xe2\x80\x99s leading museums have been vocal in the past week about their opposition to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order, 'b'which is still being enforced'b' at some airports. James Cuno, who leads the Getty in Los Angeles, 'b'called the order'b' \xe2\x80\x9cill advised, unnecessary and destructive.\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas P. Campbell, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, suggested that the blockbuster'b' \xe2\x80\x9cAssyria to Iberia\xe2\x80\x9d'b' might never have happened under Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s rules. Artists have participated in protests, 'b'especially in Los Angeles'b', home to the largest Persian community in the United States. The order will also have a negative effect on arts journalism; 'b'Roxana Azimi'b', the arts correspondent for Le Monde, is no longer able to enter the United States, as she was born in Iran.'b'But the speed and directness with which 'b'MoMA'b' \xe2\x80\x94 not an institution usually thought of as nimble \xe2\x80\x94 has responded to Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s ban are especially impressive. Its particular force comes from the curators\xe2\x80\x99 decision to present these works on the fifth floor, in the galleries most steeped in MoMA\xe2\x80\x99s flowchart narrative of Modernist development. The Iranian, Iraqi and Sudanese art does not merely disrupt the old timeline of art history; it disrupts MoMA\xe2\x80\x99s own institutional character. It says: Even the room in which Picasso\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLes Demoiselles d\xe2\x80\x99Avignon\xe2\x80\x9d hangs is not irreproachable, but rather a particular story told by individuals, who at times must speak out.'b'The institution, of course, has never been divorced from power and politics. (MoMA\xe2\x80\x99s continued sponsorship from Volkswagen \xe2\x80\x94 which admitted to installing illegal software in 11 million cars worldwide, resulting in 'b'more than $4.3 billion in fines'b' \xe2\x80\x94 especially rankles.) But in the years to come, all institutions, from the most experimental to the most established, will have to decide whether to keep their heads down or whether to reply. This welcome new voice, less Olympian and more pluralistic, is not how MoMA has spoken in the past \xe2\x80\x94 but, then again, this is not how presidents have spoken in the past, either.'b'Wearing a furry animal 'b'atop his head'b' and a red tie that stretched down below his feet, 'b'Jon Stewart returned on Tuesday'b' to CBS\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cLate Show\xe2\x80\x9d and resumed his occasional role as a thorn in the side of President Trump while offering wry complaints to the host, 'b'Stephen Colbert'b', about life since Election Day.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love your outfit,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Colbert said as Mr. Stewart sat down next to his desk. \xe2\x80\x9cIs this your Donald Trump impression?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After giving a quizzical stare, Mr. Stewart replied: \xe2\x80\x9cI thought this is how men dressed now. The president sets men\xe2\x80\x99s fashion, and I saw the inauguration. Super long tie, dead animal on head. Boom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The bulk of Mr. Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s appearance was devoted to his recitation, in a willfully halfhearted Trump accent, of several new executive orders, the president\xe2\x80\x99s preferred style of leadership thus far. The first order: \xe2\x80\x9cTo secure our border, China shall immediately, and without hesitation, send us their wall. Done. Boom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To get Mexico to pay for it, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the wall arrives at the southern border, we shut the lights; we pretend we\xe2\x80\x99re not home,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stewart said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s C.O.D.; Mexico has to sign for it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also announced: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica now finally has an official language. The new official language of the United States is\xe2\x80\x9d baloney. (Mr. Stewart used a far stronger word beginning with \xe2\x80\x9cb.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Mr. Stewart then read a third executive order of greater length:'b'Mr. Stewart\xe2\x80\x99s appearance at the Ed Sullivan Theater was the latest of the rare visits he has made to this or any other television program since 'b'stepping down'b' at \xe2\x80\x9cThe Daily Show,\xe2\x80\x9d the Comedy Central news satire he hosted from 1999 to 2015. (That is also where Mr. Colbert first broke through, as a supremely arch correspondent, before going on to host \xe2\x80\x9cThe Colbert Report.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Mr. Stewart, who is an executive producer on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Late Show,\xe2\x80\x9d has popped up on the program from time to time, most notably during live episodes that were broadcast in July after the Republican National Convention. 'b'A comedy sketch revealed'b' that he had been living in a cabin with Mr. Colbert\xe2\x80\x99s conservative alter ego throughout the 2016 election campaign, unaware that Mr. Trump had clinched the Republican presidential nomination.'b'And in 'b'a lengthy, passionate, desk-side monologue'b', Mr. Stewart had gone after Fox News and its hosts like Sean Hannity, who he felt had been too deferential to Mr. Trump during the campaign.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou feel that you\xe2\x80\x99re this country\xe2\x80\x99s rightful owners,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Stewart said in the monologue. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s only one problem with that.

He was 102.'b'His death was confirmed by his son, Richard Corey.'b'Although he inhabited other characters in stage and film roles, Mr. Corey was best known as his alter ego, the professor of some unspecified discipline who could foment clouds of inspired nonsense.'b'Dressed in his trademark outfit \xe2\x80\x94 black swallowtail coat, string tie and sneakers \xe2\x80\x94 with his hair marching in several directions at once, Mr. Corey was a caricature of every windbag who ever emptied his lungs. He was also taking aim at everyone who did not share his unrepentant leftist\xe2\x80\x99s view of the world.'b'Still, when he declared, \xe2\x80\x9cIf we don\xe2\x80\x99t change direction soon, we\xe2\x80\x99ll end up where we\xe2\x80\x99re going,\xe2\x80\x9d who could disagree?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I do is deflate the coat of righteousness that people wrap themselves in,\xe2\x80\x9d he once said offstage, adding that his target was \xe2\x80\x9cthe guy who gives his opinions as if they were handed down from the Mount.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'No question was too simple that Mr. Corey couldn\xe2\x80\x99t complicate it. His response to \xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you wear tennis shoes?\xe2\x80\x9d was a classic example: \xe2\x80\x9cActually, that is two questions. The first is \xe2\x80\x98Why?\xe2\x80\x99 This is a question that philosophers have been pondering for centuries. As for the second question, \xe2\x80\x98Do you wear tennis shoes?,\xe2\x80\x99 the answer is yes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Among his admirers was the critic Kenneth Tynan, who called Mr. Corey \xe2\x80\x9cChaplin\xe2\x80\x99s clown with a college education.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Corey never wavered in his left-leaning political views. He was outspoken in his admiration for Fidel Castro, although he was glad to find a joke in United States tensions with Cuba. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat you have to do to prevent conflict with Cuba,\xe2\x80\x9d he said in 1970, \xe2\x80\x9cis to shove Florida up the Mississippi, where she\xe2\x80\x99ll be 500 miles away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One of Mr. Corey\xe2\x80\x99s best-remembered routines was staged not in a club or broadcast studio but at Alice Tully Hall in Manhattan, at the National Book Awards ceremony in 1974. That year 'b'the fiction prize was shared'b' by Isaac Bashevis Singer and Thomas Pynchon. No one in the crowd had any idea what the reclusive Mr. Pynchon looked like, and when Mr. Corey arrived to accept the award for him (the novelist had approved the stunt), many people thought they were getting their first look at Mr. Pynchon.'b'They soon learned otherwise. Beginning his remarks, as he often did, \xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Corey referred to the author as \xe2\x80\x9cRichard Python\xe2\x80\x9d and said, \xe2\x80\x9cToday we must all be aware that protocol takes precedence over procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cMarx, Groucho Marx, once said that religion is the opiate of the people. I say that when religion outlives its usefulness, then opium will be the opiate. Ah, that\xe2\x80\x99s not a bad idea.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Times reported the next morning that Mr. Corey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cseries of bad jokes and mangled syntax\xe2\x80\x9d left \xe2\x80\x9csome people roaring with laughter and others perplexed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Irwin Corey was born Irwin Eli Cohen on July 29, 1914, in Brooklyn. Along with five of his siblings, he became a ward of the Brooklyn Hebrew Orphan Asylum, which released him to his own devices when he was 13. The future \xe2\x80\x9cprofessor\xe2\x80\x9d had one year of high school.'b'Before drifting into performing in the late 1930s, he worked for the Civilian Conservation Corps, becoming its boxing champion in the 112-pound class, then hanging up his gloves after he knocked an opponent out cold. He was also a button maker and an enthusiastic member of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.'b'In 1938 he was hired to help write and appear in the union\xe2\x80\x99s musical show \xe2\x80\x9cPins and Needles,\xe2\x80\x9d and he soon began to develop his signature comedy style of zany improvisation. (\xe2\x80\x9cI ad-lib it,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t need new material.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'He appeared in the revue \xe2\x80\x9cNew Faces of 1943\xe2\x80\x9d and in nightclubs like the Village Vanguard. The folk singer Richard Dyer-Bennet awarded Mr. Corey the rank of professor after hearing his fractured lecture on Shakespeare.'b'Mr. Corey and his wife, the former Frances Berman, lived for many years in Great Neck, on Long Island, and later in the East 30s in Manhattan. Frances Corey died in 2011. In addition to their son, Mr. Corey is survived by two grandsons and two great-grandchildren. His daughter, Margaret, died in 1997.'b'During World War II, Mr. Corey served briefly in the Army. He later said he had been discharged after about six months when an Army psychiatrist asked him if he was homosexual and he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s none of your business.\xe2\x80\x9d He immediately resumed his civilian career.'b'Mr. Corey appeared in stage productions, including works by Moli\xc3\xa8re and Chekhov, a U.S.O. tour of \xe2\x80\x9cOklahoma!\xe2\x80\x9d (as the Persian peddler) and seven Broadway shows. He said he once played Jesus in Boston: \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a piece of typecasting for a short Jewish atheist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 1974 he played Marlo Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s father in Herb Gardner\xe2\x80\x99s Broadway comedy \xe2\x80\x9cThieves.\xe2\x80\x9d In his review in The New York Times, 'b'Clive Barnes called Mr. Corey'b' \xe2\x80\x9ca clown of shining absurdity\xe2\x80\x9d and said he had \xe2\x80\x9cmanic moments of near genius.\xe2\x80\x9d Reviewing Mr. Corey\xe2\x80\x99s performance in a 2004 revival of \xe2\x80\x9cSly Fox,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Ben Brantley wrote 'b'in The Times, \xe2\x80\x9cThe nonagenarian Professor Irwin Corey makes a winningly precise art of being addled.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His feature films included \xe2\x80\x9cHow to Commit Marriage\xe2\x80\x9d (1969), starring Bob Hope and Jackie Gleason; the hit comedy 'b' \xe2\x80\x9cCar Wash\xe2\x80\x9d'b' (1976), whose cast also included Richard Pryor and George Carlin; and Woody Allen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCurse of the Jade Scorpion\xe2\x80\x9d (2001).'b'Mr. Corey perfected his portrayal of the professor in clubs like the hungry i in San Francisco and Le Ruban Bleu, Upstairs at the Downstairs and the Playboy Club in New York. On radio, his professor was a tutor to Edgar Bergen\xe2\x80\x99s dummy Charlie McCarthy. He then made the transition to television, becoming a familiar figure alongside talk-show hosts from Steve Allen to David Letterman, even though some network executives were leery of his political views.'b''b'He kept performing into his 90s and beyond'b', and not always in typical show-business locales. As 'b'The Times reported in 2011'b', for many years he would stand in traffic on East 35th Street, near the Manhattan exit of the Queens-Midtown Tunnel and a short walk from his home, almost every day, soliciting change from drivers. Some recognized him, but most apparently assumed he was just another homeless panhandler.'b'He said he donated whatever money he was given to a charity that buys medical supplies for children in Cuba. But that was not really the point.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not about money,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Corey\xe2\x80\x99s longtime agent, Irvin Arthur, told The Times. \xe2\x80\x9cFor Irwin, this is an extension of his performing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He eventually became too frail to continue panhandling, but he remained in the public eye a while longer. In April 2014 he spoke at a screening of'b' \xe2\x80\x9cIrwin &amp; Fran,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' a documentary feature about him and his wife, at the Anthology Film Archives in the East Village. That summer he spoke at'b' a party for his 100th birthday'b' at the Actors Temple in Midtown, where the festivities included a statement from the Manhattan borough president, Gale Brewer, declaring July 29 Irwin Corey Day.'b'Even as his health declined, Mr. Corey\xe2\x80\x99s spirit remained strong. As he himself put it more than once, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel more like I do now than when I first got here.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s shock-and-awe attack on truth, decorum and liberal sensibilities is intended to bludgeon his opponents into submission, \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d felt like his latest victim this weekend.'b'Not that the show, which has been one of his most outspoken and popular antagonists, didn\xe2\x80\x99t remain on the attack. Melissa McCarthy reprised her savage impersonation of Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, and Alec Baldwin (in his 17th appearance as host) donned his flaxen wig and prosthetic jowls to play Mr. Trump in a \xe2\x80\x9cPeople\xe2\x80\x99s Court\xe2\x80\x9d sketch mocking the president\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to have his travel ban reinstated. Kate McKinnon \xe2\x80\x94 who, in a 'b'Tatiana Maslany-style'b' tour de force, also appeared as Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Senator Elizabeth Warren \xe2\x80\x94 played the presidential counselor Kellyanne Conway trying to seduce her way onto CNN in a \xe2\x80\x9cFatal Attraction\xe2\x80\x9d spoof.'b'But there was a sense of exhaustion \xe2\x80\x94 of \xe2\x80\x9cHow long can we keep this up?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that was made explicit in the court sketch when Cecily Strong, as the judge, said to Mr. Baldwin\xe2\x80\x99s Trump: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re doing too much. I want one day without a CNN alert that scares the hell out of me.\xe2\x80\x9d It was delivered plaintively, not as a laugh line but as a weary, nervous plea.'b'Ms. McCarthy opened the show as Mr. Spicer, and the news-briefing sketch was again the high point. Its simple premise \xe2\x80\x94 take the thin-skinned, venomous attitude and brazen duplicity the Trump administration has exhibited and render them as naked, schoolyard-bully aggression \xe2\x80\x94 was still effective, coupled with Ms. McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s absolute commitment.'b'But the sketch was even more underwritten than before, name-checking controversies rather than illuminating them, which has been true of most of the show\xe2\x80\x99s Trump-related material. In the absence of new ideas, old ones recycled from last week\xe2\x80\x99s sketch were simply amped up: The wad of chewing gum was bigger, the weaponized rostrum was now motorized. The physical attacks on reporters here included an assault with a leaf blower, which was jolting and kind of fascinating when the machine was pointed at the face of a reporter played by Ms. Strong, but not so funny when it was used to blow her skirt up over her head.'b'Mr. Baldwin came out as himself for his monologue, which did not address politics. He finally appeared as Mr. Trump an hour into the show, facing off against the judges of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and asking for a reinstatement of the travel ban, as well as $725. It was a routine sketch, briefly enlivened by the appearance of a bare-chested Beck Bennett as President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, calling Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x9cmy little American Happy Meal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Bennett also played the CNN host Jake Tapper in the Conway sketch, which never quite found its tone and had a queasy edge of sexism, but at least wasn\xe2\x80\x99t boring. Lying in wait for Mr. Tapper at his apartment, Ms. McKinnon\xe2\x80\x99s Conway writhed and moaned, desperate to get back on TV. (Last week, 'b'CNN turned down'b' the offer of an interview with Ms. Conway.) When Mr. Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s Tapper said, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re just going to keep lying,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied, \xe2\x80\x9cYou need to reach inside me and pull out the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d before threatening him with a kitchen knife.'b'The episode\xe2\x80\x99s funnier moments were mostly Trump-free. An 'b'amusing sketch'b' in which competing ad agencies pitched a new Cheetos campaign had political overtones but no overt Trump references. A bit in which Kenan Thompson and Tracy Morgan played 'b'Beyonc\xc3\xa9'b''b'\xe2\x80\x99s twin sons'b' in the womb was pedestrian, but at least had the pleasurable jolt of seeing Mr. Morgan. The best moment of the night was when Mr. Baldwin appeared to flub a line, saying \xe2\x80\x9ccookie chillout\xe2\x80\x9d instead of \xe2\x80\x9cchili cookout.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s political fortunes have risen, \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday Night Live\xe2\x80\x9d has benefited, 'b'at least in ratings'b', from its perceived status as the official television opposition to him and, now, his administration. Based on Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s episode, it will be a hard if not impossible task to keep up for four years, if Mr. Trump stays in power that long and keeps making news \xe2\x80\x94 and outraging much of the country \xe2\x80\x94 at his current rate.'b''b'Joseph Mascolo'b', who played the crime boss Stefano DiMera on the NBC soap opera \xe2\x80\x9cDays of Our Lives\xe2\x80\x9d across three decades, last appearing on the show this year, died on Dec. 8 in Santa Clarita, Calif.

These things are true.'b'But so what?'b'The show must go on. And it can\xe2\x80\x99t go on so long as Franny is on the scene. We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen this before; it\xe2\x80\x99s a narrative necessity. In the past, Carrie\xe2\x80\x99s sister or father carted the little girl off, and Jonas stepped in last season. Now it\xe2\x80\x99s the top-notch nanny and her husband, whose idea of \xe2\x80\x9cfriendly faces\xe2\x80\x9d clearly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t include Quinn\xe2\x80\x99s. So. Much. Judgment.'b'I think we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t view Quinn\xe2\x80\x99s child care skills so harshly. The shooting incident was a 'b'natural consequence'b'; the brouhaha that preceded it, a teachable moment. People who throw rocks are making bad choices. It\xe2\x80\x99s never too early to learn these important life lessons.'b'And let\xe2\x80\x99s be honest: Carrie knew, when she looked at her old friend playing stuffed animals with Franny and had a \xe2\x80\x9cgood feeling \xe2\x80\xa6 the best feeling I\xe2\x80\x99d had in a really long time\xe2\x80\x9d that she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t auditioning him for the job of media-relations specialist. She was looking at Quinn \xe2\x80\x94 a professional killer \xe2\x80\x94 segueing into the role of Peter, the guy who still may hold the only hope of helping her weave together all the heretofore incompatible pieces of her crazy life.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re not quite there yet. But let\xe2\x80\x99s not despair. Quinn\xe2\x80\x99s bout of extreme (surrogate) parenting has done the trick. Franny is off to safety \xe2\x80\x94 her exquisite wardrobe soon to follow \xe2\x80\x94 and Carrie is free to get down to business. She has proof now that Quinn isn\xe2\x80\x99t crazy. His instinct about the burly white guy with the beanie and bomb-making bag was spot on. So were his surveillance skills. Who knew you could get such a perfectly centered license plate photo from a smartphone while experiencing muscle spasms and tremors?'b'Carrie has evidence now to show the F.B.I. to build a case for foul play. And Agent Conlin is listening. Clearly, he suspects that he has been set up by dark forces in the government.'b'I think that some fruitful partnership may soon be in the making.'b'I suspect, too, that Quinn is going to end up face to face with Dar Adal. Which means that something nasty is about to transpire, pitting Quinn, Carrie and Saul and the president-elect against Dar and the 'b'Deep State'b' that\xe2\x80\x99s gearing up to oppose the new White House.'b'Dar was positively glowing early in this episode, but Saul\xe2\x80\x99s news of the meeting with Javadi wiped the smile right off his craggy face. Which should remind us that Saul didn\xe2\x80\x99t get Javadi to spy on his own country by offering him a lifetime subscription to Harry &amp; David. Grandfatherly beard aside, this veteran of innumerable internecine agency wars has a solid steel core, and a confidence this season that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen since he got Carrie to go off her meds and endure ECT in order to set the Iran play into motion.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on the transition team,\xe2\x80\x9d he told Etai last week, which sounded like something of a boast. But with the president-elect essentially under house arrest, cut off from her staff and saddled with a scary Mrs. Danvers as a minder, who knows where the transition is going?'b'Keane\xe2\x80\x99s travails, clearly, have only just begun. The Alex-Jones-style shock jock has promised her \xe2\x80\x9cthe fight of your life.\xe2\x80\x9d And I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a fair one.'b'The Songwriters Hall of Fame will honor a rapper for the first time at its 48th annual induction ceremony: Jay Z.'b'The Brooklyn M.C. born Shawn Carter, known for hits like \xe2\x80\x9cHard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem),\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBig Pimpin\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cIzzo (H.O.V.A.)\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEmpire State of Mind,\xe2\x80\x9d headlines an induction group this year that also includes Kenneth Edmonds (best known as Babyface); the R&amp;B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis; the Top 40 maestro Max Martin; and the band Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s chief songwriters, Robert Lamm, James Pankow and Peter Cetera. The Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr., who deferred his induction last year, will also be honored.'b'In an announcement on Wednesday, the Hall of Fame\xe2\x80\x99s co-chairs, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, along with its president, Linda Moran, said that with its new class, the organization \xe2\x80\x9cmoves definitively into recognizing music creators of the 21st century while continuing to honor the greats of earlier decades.\xe2\x80\x9d They added, \xe2\x80\x9cThe songwriters we honor cross genre, regional and even national boundaries \xe2\x80\x94 R&amp;B, rap, pop and rock \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 roll from both coasts, the American heartland and Sweden.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The ceremony will take place on June 15 at the Marriott Marquis Hotel in Manhattan.'b'With its gesture toward hip-hop, the Songwriters Hall of Fame follows the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in 'b'beginning to acknowledge'b' a genre that has long transcended upstart \xe2\x80\x94 or flash-in-the-pan \xe2\x80\x94 status and has become a dominant mode in modern popular music. When 'b'Tupac Shakur'b' is inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame in April, he will be the sixth hip-hop act ever voted in after Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five, Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, Public Enemy and N.W.A.'b'Ms. Moran, the president of the Songwriters Hall of Fame since 2001, said that Jay Z had previously been considered for a nomination. \xe2\x80\x9cTo be honest with you, last year we talked about it a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, but \xe2\x80\x9cour board and community wasn\xe2\x80\x99t ready. This year we felt that they had been educated enough.\xe2\x80\x9d (A group of about 20 music industry experts decides annually on a short list of two-dozen nominees, half performers and half nonperformers, five of whom are then chosen for induction by about 1,500 voting members.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJay Z is pop music but presents it in a different manner,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Moran said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis just shows that we accept it and acknowledge that. It\xe2\x80\x99s a step into the future. We can\xe2\x80\x99t nurture young songwriters if we can\xe2\x80\x99t accept them and grow with them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She added that Jay Z was \xe2\x80\x9cso over the moon\xe2\x80\x9d about his induction. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was flipping out, he was going crazy,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Jay Z, who holds the record for a solo artist with 21 No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, commented on his songwriting honor 'b'in a tweet'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the way, this is a win for US. I remember when rap was said to be a fad,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are now alongside some of the greatest writers in history.\xe2\x80\x9dIt was also acknowledged online by the Twitter account for his streaming service, Tidal.'b'The rest of this year\xe2\x80\x99s group is split between the traditional oldies contingent and more modern sounds.
