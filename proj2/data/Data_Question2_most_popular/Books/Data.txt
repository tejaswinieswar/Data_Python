b'LONDON \xe2\x80\x94 Basically, Mr. Darcy, the dark, brooding hero of one of 'b'Jane Austen'b'\xe2\x80\x99s most famous novels, \xe2\x80\x9cPride and Prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d would not have looked at all like 'b'Colin Firth'b'.'b'Rather, 'b'the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darcy'b' would have been pale and pointy-chinned, and would have had a long nose on an oval, beardless face. His hair, strangely, would have been powdered white. And he would have been slightly undernourished, with sloping shoulders \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cmore ballet dancer than beefcake,\xe2\x80\x9d according to one of the authors of a new study.'b'Hardly a steamy romantic hero, then, in modern eyes.'b'Ahead of the 200th anniversary of Austen\xe2\x80\x99s death, Fitzwilliam Darcy, the much-fantasized hero of her novel \xe2\x80\x9cPride and Prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d was given 'b'an unflattering makeover'b' in a study published on Thursday, shocking fans and possibly forever altering their adoration of English literature\xe2\x80\x99s most eligible bachelor.'b'The study \xe2\x80\x94 by 'b'John Sutherland'b', a professor of modern English literature at University College London, and 'b'Amanda Vickery'b', a professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London \xe2\x80\x94 was billed as the first historically accurate portrait of the fictional character.'b'It came attached with 'b'a series of illustrations'b' that show what a gentleman, one who shunned fieldwork, 'b'would have looked like'b' in 1813, when the novel was published.'b'A real-life Mr. Darcy in that era would have been a \xe2\x80\x9cfar cry from muscular modern-day television representations\xe2\x80\x9d portrayed by actors like Mr. Firth, Elliot Cowan and Matthew Macfadyen, the study concluded. 'b'Mr. Firth, who is most often associated with the role'b', is broad-shouldered, with short, dark curls framing a square jaw.'b'One of the most memorable moments in the 'b'BBC\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 adaptation'b' of \xe2\x80\x9cPride and Prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d showed Mr. Firth, as Mr. Darcy, emerging from a lake in a soaking-wet shirt that displayed the contours of his ripped torso.'b'Had he actually existed in 19th-century Britain, Mr. Darcy would not have been \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Colin Firth'b' emerging like Venus from the waves,\xe2\x80\x9d Professor Sutherland said. Nor would he have resembled Laurence Olivier \xe2\x80\x9clooking diabolical\xe2\x80\x9d in a 1940 film adaptation. It is likely, he surmised, that a proud Mr. Darcy \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed very little except mild contempt.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The scholars conducted a monthlong investigation into the norms of male beauty during the Georgian period (roughly 1714 to 1830), as well as the author\xe2\x80\x99s romantic relationships, thought to have provided inspiration for her hero.'b'Austen offered readers little description of Mr. Darcy, introducing him only as someone who drew \xe2\x80\x9cthe attention of the room by his fine, tall person, handsome features, noble mien.\xe2\x80\x9d The dearth of details allowed filmmakers and television producers to adapt his looks to modern beauty standards.'b'Mr. Darcy, said Professor Sutherland, is the \xe2\x80\x9cbeau id\xc3\xa9al, the male star of Austen\xe2\x80\x99s fictional world.\xe2\x80\x9d But, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t know what he looks like.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The absence of details was intentional, he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not because she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t write, but because she knew the important thing that fiction is not what you say, but what you don\xe2\x80\x99t say,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cGood practitioners of fiction know how to use this expertly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yet, even the professor admitted being unable to remove Mr. Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s association with the actors who have portrayed him. \xe2\x80\x9cColin Firth does dominate my visual field, which is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause TV and film fix an image of a character whom Jane Austen, for artistic reasons, left vacuous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Delia Cazzato, 50, from North London, was understandably upset when she read the study. She was so aghast, she said, that she almost fell off her chair.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI love \xe2\x80\x98Pride and Prejudice,\xe2\x80\x99 and when I saw the illustrations, I was disillusioned,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Darcy looked like a shorter version of Napoleon.\xe2\x80\x9d She remains a firm fan of Mr. Firth.'b'The study\xe2\x80\x99s findings that Mr. Darcy probably had a pale complexion and a long oval face were in keeping with the qualities associated with wealth and privilege during Austen\xe2\x80\x99s time because aristocrats usually avoided the sun.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the late 1790s, square jaws were practically unheard-of amongst the upper classes,\xe2\x80\x9d the study said, \xe2\x80\x9cwith the pointy chin and small mouth evident on Mr. Darcy very common features of the gentlemen of the era.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The slim, sloping shoulders of the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Darcy were often found in the landed gentry of the era, with strong legs and \xe2\x80\x9cwell modeled thighs a sign of virility, a good fencer and horseman.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'And \xe2\x80\x94 gasp! \xe2\x80\x94 he would have had only a \xe2\x80\x9cmodest chest,\xe2\x80\x9d because having a muscular chest was often associated with a \xe2\x80\x9claborer, not a gentleman,\xe2\x80\x9d the study said.'b'In drawing their conclusions by considering Austen\xe2\x80\x99s own romantic interests, the academics studied in particular John Parker, the 1st Earl of Morley, and Thomas Lefroy, who are both thought to have inspired Mr. Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s character.'b'Both men \xe2\x80\x9csported powdered hair and had long, youthful faces with pale complexions,\xe2\x80\x9d the study said. Other noblemen who were considered sex symbols of the period had similar features, including Lord Nelson, who led Britain to victory against the French in the Battle of Trafalgar, and Arthur Wellesley, the 1st Duke of Wellington, another British military hero.'b'Some readers, however, remained unfazed by Mr. Darcy\xe2\x80\x99s drastic reimagining.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what the real Mr. Darcy looks like, except for the fact that he is a figment of the imagination,\xe2\x80\x9d Stig Abell, editor of The Times Literary Supplement, wrote on Twitter. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd so it is bollocks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'MOUNT VERNON, Va. \xe2\x80\x94 The costumed characters at George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s gracious estate here are used to handling all manner of awkward queries, whether about 18th-century privies or the first president\xe2\x80\x99s teeth. So when a visitor recently asked an African-American re-enactor in a full skirt and head scarf if she knew Ona Judge, the woman didn\xe2\x80\x99t miss a beat.'b'Judge\xe2\x80\x99s escape from the presidential residence in Philadelphia in 1796 had been \xe2\x80\x9ca great embarrassment to General and Lady Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman said, before offering her own view of the matter.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOna was born free, like everybody,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was this world that made her a slave.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s always 1799 at Mount Vernon, where more than a million visitors annually see the property as it was just before Washington\xe2\x80\x99s death, when 'b'his will'b' famously freed all 123 of his slaves. That liberation did not apply to Ona Judge, one of 153 slaves 'b'held by'b' Martha Washington.'b'But Judge, it turned out, evaded the Washingtons\xe2\x80\x99 dogged (and sometimes illegal) efforts to recapture her, and would live quietly in New Hampshire for another 50 years. Now her story \xe2\x80\x94 and the challenge it offers to the notion that Washington somehow transcended the seamy reality of slaveholding \xe2\x80\x94 is having its fullest airing yet.'b'Judge is among the 19 enslaved people highlighted in 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLives Bound Together: Slavery at George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Mount Vernon,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' the first major exhibition here dedicated to the topic. She is also the subject of a book, \xe2\x80\x9cNever Caught: The Washingtons\xe2\x80\x99 Relentless Pursuit of Their Runaway Slave, Ona Judge,\xe2\x80\x9d by Erica Armstrong Dunbar.'b'Most scholars who have written about Judge\xe2\x80\x99s escape have used it as a lens onto Washington\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'evolving ideas'b' about slavery. But \xe2\x80\x9cNever Caught,\xe2\x80\x9d published on Tuesday by 37 Ink, flips the perspective, focusing on what freedom meant to the people he kept in bondage.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have the famous fugitives, like Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Dunbar, a professor of black studies and history at the University of Delaware, said in an interview in Mount Vernon\xe2\x80\x99s 18th-century-style food court. \xe2\x80\x9cBut decades before them, Ona Judge did this. I want people to know her story.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Research on slavery has exploded in the two decades since Mount Vernon, Monticello and other founder home sites introduced slavery-themed tours and other prominent acknowledgments of the enslaved. \xe2\x80\x9cLives Bound Together,\xe2\x80\x9d which runs through September 2018, was originally going to fill one 1,100-square-foot room in the museum here, but soon expanded to include six other galleries normally dedicated to the decorative and fine arts, books and manuscripts.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe had so much material, and it\xe2\x80\x99s such an important story,\xe2\x80\x9d Susan P. Schoelwer, the curator at Mount Vernon, said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe realized we could take many of the objects already on view and reframe them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The exhibition makes it clear just who poured from the elegant teapots and did the backbreaking work on the 8,000-acre estate.

One day in the archives, she noticed a 1796 newspaper ad offering $10 for the return of \xe2\x80\x9ca light Mulatto girl, much freckled, with very black eyes and bushy hair\xe2\x80\x9d who had \xe2\x80\x9cabsconded\xe2\x80\x9d from the president\xe2\x80\x99s house.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98Here I am, a scholar in this field. Why don\xe2\x80\x99t I know about her?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Dunbar recalled.'b'Since then, Judge\xe2\x80\x99s story has inspired several children\xe2\x80\x99s books, and even an episode of 'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDrunk History.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' But \xe2\x80\x9cNever Caught\xe2\x80\x9d is the first full-length nonfiction account, drawing on some newly unearthed sources to track her from Mount Vernon to New York City, Philadelphia and then New Hampshire, at a time when gradual abolition left the line between slavery and freedom ambiguous.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a myth of the North as free, but her story shows how complicated that was,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Dunbar said.'b'It is in the meticulous ledgers of Mount Vernon that we first see 'b'Ona Maria Judge'b', who was born around 1773 to an enslaved mother and a father who was a white indentured servant. At age 9 she was brought to live in the mansion house, eventually becoming Martha Washington\xe2\x80\x99s personal maid.'b'When Washington became president, Judge followed the first couple to New York and then Philadelphia, home to a growing free black community.'b'Free blacks, Ms. Dunbar writes, aided Judge\xe2\x80\x99s escape in the midst of a presidential dinner, after she had learned that she was to be given to Martha Washington\xe2\x80\x99s granddaughter, Eliza. And it was free blacks who helped her catch a sailing ship to Portsmouth, N.H., where she married, had three children and lived on the edge of poverty, laboring in households far less exalted than the Washingtons\xe2\x80\x99.'b'In two interviews published in abolitionist newspapers shortly before her death in 1848, Judge testified to the desire for freedom that drove her to run away from the Washington household, where she had \xe2\x80\x9cnever received the least moral or mental instruction,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Judge\xe2\x80\x99s story, Ms. Dunbar said, explodes any notion of \xe2\x80\x9cprivileged\xe2\x80\x9d house slaves, or of the benevolence of the Washingtons, whose far from passive role in perpetuating slavery \xe2\x80\x94 and in doling out sometimes brutal punishment to the rebellious \xe2\x80\x94 is described in detail.'b'Ms. Dunbar describes how the Washingtons quietly maneuvered around Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s 1780 gradual abolition law, rotating their slaves in and out of the state every six months. And she recounts their shock at the \xe2\x80\x9cingratitude\xe2\x80\x9d of Judge, who fled \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any provocation,\xe2\x80\x9d the president wrote.'b'After hearing that Judge was in Portsmouth, Washington, offering a story that she had been \xe2\x80\x9centiced away by a Frenchman,\xe2\x80\x9d discreetly sent a federal customs officer to bring her back, circumventing procedures laid out in the 1793 fugitive slave law he himself had signed.'b'When Judge agreed to return on condition that she be freed on Martha\xe2\x80\x99s death, George Washington dismissed her demand as \xe2\x80\x9ctotally inadmissible.\xe2\x80\x9d However much he might favor general emancipation, he wrote to the customs officer, granting Judge any say in her fate would only \xe2\x80\x9creward unfaithfulness\xe2\x80\x9d and give ideas to others \xe2\x80\x9cfar more deserving of favor.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In August 1799, Washington, through another associate, tried again to capture her, but was foiled when Judge received a tip about the plot and disappeared.'b'Four months later Washington was dead, freeing all his slaves in his will. Judge and the others held by Martha Washington remained her legal property.'b'Ms. Dunbar calls Washington\xe2\x80\x99s act \xe2\x80\x9cno small thing,\xe2\x80\x9d but does not see the former president, who had no biological children to disinherit, as the hero of the story.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen it was safe, he emancipated his slaves,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe dealt with it after his death. And you know what? That\xe2\x80\x99s what all the founders did with slavery: They kicked the can down the road.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'WHITE TRASH'b''b''b'The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America'b''b'By Nancy Isenberg'b'Illustrated. 460 pp. Viking. $28.'b''b''b''b'No line about class in the United States is more famous than the one written by the German sociologist Werner Sombart in 1906. Class consciousness in America, he contended, foundered \xe2\x80\x9con the shoals of roast beef and apple pie.\xe2\x80\x9d Sombart was among the first scholars to ask the question, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy is there no socialism in the United States?\xe2\x80\x9d His answer, now solidified into conventional wisdom about American exceptionalism, was simple: \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica is a freer and more egalitarian society than Europe.\xe2\x80\x9d In the United States, he argued, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not the stigma of being the class apart that almost all European workers have about them. .\xe2\x80\x88.\xe2\x80\x88. The bowing and scraping before the \xe2\x80\x98upper classes,\xe2\x80\x99 which produces such an unpleasant impression in Europe, is completely unknown.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Trash,\xe2\x80\x9d Nancy Isenberg joins a long list of historians over the last century who have sent Sombart\xe2\x80\x99s theory crashing on the shoals of history. The prolific Charles and Mary Beard, progressive historians in the first third of the 20th century, reinterpreted American history as a struggle for economic power between the haves and have-nots. W.E.B. Du Bois interpreted Reconstruction as a great class rebellion, as freed slaves fought to control their own working conditions and wages. Labor and political historians in the 1970s and 1980s recovered a forgotten history of blue-collar consciousness and grass-roots radicalism, from the Workingmen\xe2\x80\x99s Party in Andrew Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s America to the late-19th-century populists of upcountry Georgia to the Depression-era leftist unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Historians of public policy, like the influential Michael B. Katz, emphasized the persistence of notions of \xe2\x80\x9cthe undeserving poor,\xe2\x80\x9d an ideology that blamed economic deprivation on the alleged pathological behavior of poor people themselves and eroded support for welfare programs.'b'So Isenberg\xe2\x80\x99s story is not, as her subtitle suggests, \xe2\x80\x9cuntold.\xe2\x80\x9d But she retells it with unusual ambition and (to use a class-\xc2\xadladen term) in a masterly manner. Ranging from John Rolfe and Pocahontas to \xe2\x80\x9cThe Beverly Hillbillies,\xe2\x80\x9d Isenberg \xe2\x80\x94 a historian at Louisiana State University whose previous books include a \xc2\xadbiography of Aaron Burr \xe2\x80\x94 provides a cultural \xc2\xadhistory of changing concepts of class and inferiority. She argues that British colonizers saw their North American empire as a place to dump their human waste: the idle, indigent and criminal. Richard Hakluyt the younger, one of the many colorful characters who fill these pages, saw the continent as \xe2\x80\x9cone giant workhouse,\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xadIsenberg\xe2\x80\x99s phrase, where the feckless poor could be turned into industrious drudges.'b'That process of shunting outsiders to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s margins, she argues, continued in the early Republic and in the 19th century, when landless white settlers began to fill in the backcountry of Appalachia and the swamps of the lowland South, living in lowly cabins, dreaming of landownership but mostly toiling as exploited tenant farmers or itinerant laborers.'b'In the book\xe2\x80\x99s most ingenious passages, Isenberg offers a catalog of the insulting terms well-off Americans used to denigrate their economic inferiors. In 17th-century Virginia, critics of rebellious indentured servants denounced them as society\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coffscourings,\xe2\x80\x9d a term for fecal matter. A hundred years later, elites railed against the \xe2\x80\x9cuseless lubbers\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Carolina,\xe2\x80\x9d a place she calls the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst white trash colony.\xe2\x80\x9d In the early 19th century, landowners described the landless rural poor as boisterous, foolish \xe2\x80\x9ccrackers\xe2\x80\x9d and idle, vagabond \xe2\x80\x9csquatters.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not all stereotypes of the white poor were negative. In the Jacksonian period, populists celebrated Davy Crockett and his coonskin cap. Lincoln might be derided as a poor woodsman, but he was also valorized for his log cabin roots. During the Great Depression, New Deal photographers and writers depicted farmers displaced by the Dust Bowl as virtuous people, victims of economic forces beyond their control.'b'By the second half of the 19th century and into the 20th, Isenberg shows, crude caricatures gave way to seemingly scientific explanations of lower-class status. \xe2\x80\x9cClass was congenital,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes, summarizing a mid-19th-century view of poor whites. One writer highlighted the \xe2\x80\x9cruntish forefathers\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cconsumptive parents\xe2\x80\x9d who birthed a \xe2\x80\x9cnotorious race\xe2\x80\x9d of inferior white people. Essayists described human differences by borrowing terminology from specialists in animal husbandry. Just as dogs could be distinguished by their breeds and horses distinguished from mules, so could people be characterized as superior or inferior based on their physical traits.'b'By the late 19th century, some writers used family genealogies to trace the roots of criminality, illness and insanity, and warn of the dangers of \xe2\x80\x9cdegeneration.\xe2\x80\x9d By the early 20th century, armed with increasingly sophisticated statistical tools and new understandings of genetics, eugenicists offered the most chilling of responses to poor whites: They argued that the state should use its power to keep them from reproducing. Those arguments shaped one of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s most notorious decisions, Buck v. Bell (1927), in which the court, with Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes writing for the majority, upheld a Virginia sterilization program to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cgenerations of imbeciles\xe2\x80\x9d from proliferating and thus to keep the nation from being \xe2\x80\x9cswamped with incompetence.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The story of eugenics offers an example of the ways that, throughout the American past, questions of class status have been entangled with notions of racial inferiority. Isenberg makes a strong case that one of the most common ways of stigmatizing poor people was to question their racial identity. Backcountry vagabonds were often compared unfavorably with the \xe2\x80\x9csavage,\xe2\x80\x9d nomadic Indian. Sun-browned tenant farmers faced derision for their less-than-white appearance. After the emancipation of slaves, politicians warned of the rise of a \xe2\x80\x9cmongrel\xe2\x80\x9d nation, fearful that white bloodlines would be contaminated by blacks, a process that might expand the ranks of \xe2\x80\x9ctrash\xe2\x80\x9d people.'b'But Isenberg falls prey to one of the most common and pernicious fallacies in American popular discourse about class: For her, America\xe2\x80\x99s landless farmers and precarious workers are by default white. \xe2\x80\x9cClass,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes, \xe2\x80\x9chad its own singular and powerful dynamic, apart from its intersection with race.\xe2\x80\x9d Thus we get a history of class in America that \xc2\xaddiscusses white tenant farmers at length, but scarcely mentions black sharecroppers or Mexican farmworkers, as if somehow their race segregated them from America\xe2\x80\x99s history of class subjugation. Native Americans make cameo appearances playing their role as a degraded race or as the noble savage \xe2\x80\x94 as ideal types rather than as \xc2\xadexploited and impoverished peoples themselves. The \xe2\x80\x9ccoolie\xe2\x80\x9d Asian workers imported to the post-Civil War South, the Filipino agricultural laborers of California\xe2\x80\x99s Central Valley and the inhabitants of San Francisco\xe2\x80\x99s and New York\xe2\x80\x99s 19th-\xc2\xadcentury Chinatowns, all workers, most at the bottom of the economic ladder, are virtually absent from these pages, even though they were subject to caricatures stunningly similar to those hurled at backcountry \xe2\x80\x9csquatters\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chillbillies.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is a commonplace argument in American politics that somehow race and class stand apart. Pundits charge that racial minorities practice a self-segregating \xe2\x80\x9cidentity politics\xe2\x80\x9d rather than uniting around shared economic grievances. But a history of class in America that assumes its whiteness and relegates the nonwhite poor to the backstage is one that misses the fundamental reality of economic inequality in American history, that race and class were \xe2\x80\x94 and are \xe2\x80\x94 fundamentally entwined.'b'One way to regard the refugees in the news these frenzied past few days is as potential Americans, individuals and families escaping bad situations who imagine themselves building new lives here. What these particular refugees could become in this country, and how they could contribute to our society and culture, is a question stuck in suspended animation. But we do have the power to look to the past. And in the literary realm it\xe2\x80\x99s unquestionable that refugees, once here, often make major contributions.'b'Through the 20th century and into this one, those fleeing political persecution or war have produced important works that we think of now as at least partly American, from fiction about the harrowing experiences of exile and dislocation to political treatises by thinkers who want to understand why their homelands fell apart. This is a sampling of 25 of those works.'b''b'Bertolt Brecht,'b' \xe2\x80\x9cThe Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui\xe2\x80\x9d (1941)'b''b'Country of origin:'b' Germany'b''b'Reason for leaving:'b' Fled Nazi Germany for Denmark in 1933, and then came to the United States in 1941 when war broke out.'b''b''b'Brecht always intended his satire about the ruthless ascension of a Chicago mobster to be performed on an American stage.

Why that gamble failed is the urgently timely question answered by this deeply researched, tightly argued and accessibly concise book.'b'Hoping to stabilize the region, Doran argues, Eisenhower instead convulsed it. Seeking to assuage radicals, his administration instead empowered them.'b'Doran, a senior director of the National Security Council in the George W.

He writes with the authority of the scholar and the familiarity of the senior policy adviser.'b'In 1953, most of the Middle East was ruled by cautious, Western-aligned leaders who had come to power after World War I. They were backed by British military power.

That summer, a group of nationalist military officers overthrew Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s monarchy. They reviled the government for its failure to destroy Israel, and for a too-cozy relationship with Britain and the West. Although only a colonel at the time of the coup, Nasser soon emerged as the new regime\xe2\x80\x99s dominant personality.'b'The Eisenhower administration relied on the advice of officials who admired Nasser as a nationalist and anti-Communist: a secular modernizer, the long hoped-for \xe2\x80\x9cArab Ataturk.\xe2\x80\x9d The most important and forceful of the Nasser admirers was Kermit Roosevelt, the C.I.A. officer who had done so much in 1953 to restore to power in Iran that other secular modernizer, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.'b'To befriend Nasser, the Eisenhower administration suggested a big increase in economic and military aid; pressed Israel to surrender much of the Negev to Egypt and Jordan; supported Nasser\xe2\x80\x99s demand that the British military vacate the canal zone; and clandestinely provided Nasser with much of the equipment \xe2\x80\x94 and many of the technical experts \xe2\x80\x94 who built his radio station Voice of the Arabs into the most influential propaganda network in the Arab-speaking world. Yet each of these overtures produced only grief \xe2\x80\x94 as Eisenhower himself soon came to learn.'b'Offers of aid were leveraged by Nasser to extract better terms from the Soviet Union, his preferred military partner. Pressure on Israel did not impress Nasser, who wanted a permanent crisis he could exploit to mobilize Arab opinion behind him. Forcing Britain out of the canal zone in the mid-50s enabled Nasser to grab the canal itself in 1956. Rather than use his radio network to warn Arabs against Communism, Nasser employed it to inflame Arab opinion against the West\xe2\x80\x99s most reliable regional allies, the Hashemite monarchies, helping to topple Iraq\xe2\x80\x99s regime in 1958 and very nearly finishing off Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'Bluntly put: Nasser had duped Eisenhower. \xe2\x80\x9cNasser proved to be a complete stumbling block,\xe2\x80\x9d Eisenhower confided to his diary as his Arab-Israeli peace efforts failed. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is apparently seeking to be acknowledged as the political leader of the Arab world.\xe2\x80\x9d He has concluded \xe2\x80\x9che should just make speeches, all of which breathe defiance of Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Eisenhower left office with anti-American regimes in power not only in Cairo, but also in Damascus and Baghdad. Eisenhower\xe2\x80\x99s humiliation of Britain and France in the Suez crisis of November 1956 weakened two allies \xe2\x80\x94 without gaining an iota of good will from Arab nationalists. Rather than cooperate with the United States against the Soviet Union, the Arab world\xe2\x80\x99s new nationalist strongmen were transfixed by their rivalries with one another. It was instead formerly despised Israel that emerged not only as America\xe2\x80\x99s most reliable ally but also as far and away the region\xe2\x80\x99s most capable military power. \xe2\x80\x9cI never should have pressured Israel to evacuate the Sinai,\xe2\x80\x9d Eisenhower lamented in 1965. He endorsed Israel\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive Six Day War of 1967 in an interview a few weeks after the fighting.'b'As an enriched and empowered Iran becomes more aggressive abroad and more repressive at home, will such regrets eventually haunt President Obama too? That may depend more on the personality of the president than any external event.'b'Eisenhower was a pragmatist in the strictest philosophical sense: someone who judges the truth of theories according to their success or failure in practice. He came to office holding one view of the Middle East. When that view failed, he discarded it in favor of another.'b'But pragmatism of that kind is a very unusual trait, and especially unusual in politicians. Eisenhower may have rethought his gamble on Nasser. The subordinates who executed the policy, however, insisted to the end that any failure was somebody else\xe2\x80\x99s fault. Their self-justifications have reverberated into journalism and history.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98inside story\xe2\x80\x99 of the Eisenhower administration\xe2\x80\x99s Middle East policy,\xe2\x80\x9d Doran writes, \xe2\x80\x9ccomes to us not from Eisenhower and Dulles but from .\xe2\x80\x88.\xe2\x80\x88. the very men .\xe2\x80\x88.\xe2\x80\x88. who were most personally invested in the courtship of Nasser, and who fought against all efforts to abandon it. .\xe2\x80\x88.\xe2\x80\x88. Muscular Western policies, we learn, will almost always backfire.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With only a very few edits and updates, this mode of analysis will serve marvelously to excuse any disappointments in the Iran legacy the current generation of policy makers may leave behind. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the lesson that Doran wishes they would learn instead: the error of the belief \xe2\x80\x9cthat distancing the United States from Israel would win the good will of all Arabs, and especially the Egyptians.\xe2\x80\x9d This belief \xe2\x80\x9cprevented them from recognizing the deepest drivers of the Arab and Muslim states, namely their rivalries with each other for power and authority.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Americans wish to solve problems \xe2\x80\x94 and they are accordingly always quick to assume that problems must have solutions. Does a nation express grievances against the United States? Mollify them with concessions and compromises. Do the grievances sound irrational? Begin a process of trust-building that can lead to more fruitful dialogue. Do they traffic in imperial fantasies and threats of genocidal violence? Downplay those as overheated rhetoric for domestic consumption.'b'After all, that\xe2\x80\x99s how Americans behave. And isn\xe2\x80\x99t everybody on earth fundamentally like us? Not so much, Doran warns. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Middle East is in the throes of an historical crisis, a prolonged period of instability. American policy can exacerbate or ameliorate the major conflicts, but .\xe2\x80\x88.\xe2\x80\x88. in the Middle East, it is prudent to assume that the solution to every problem will inevitably generate new problems. Like Sisyphus, the United States has no choice but to push the boulder up a hill whose pinnacle remains forever out of reach.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Doran\xe2\x80\x99s profoundly humbling message will not be very welcome to ambitious policy makers of any political stripe. For that reason, it is all the more valuable as the Obama administration leaves office unchastened by adverse experience \xe2\x80\x94 and its potential successors assess the grim options they inherit.'b''b'David Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic and chairman of the British think tank Policy Exchange, was a speechwriter for President George W.

The Great Man Theory has long since been junked by academics, if not popular historians. The course of history, the scholars say, owes more to impersonal forces and serendipity than to the efforts of some dead white males. That is true enough, but from time to time, at critical instances, great men have made a difference, for better or for worse.'b'The Suez crisis of 1956 was one of the moments. It began as a last gasp of colonialism, a plot by Britain and France, working with Israel, to reclaim the Suez Canal, recently nationalized by Egypt. The scheme was the fruit of human folly, principally and most notably that of the British prime minister, Anthony Eden.'b'The grand conspiracy was doomed to fail. The canal was blocked for months, causing a crippling oil shortage in Europe. The Arab-Israeli conflict worsened, and the Muslim world was inflamed against its old overlords in the West with lasting consequences. The botched invasion occurred just as the Soviet Union was crushing a rebellion in Hungary, its Eastern bloc satellite. When the Kremlin, seeing the opportunity to divert international attention from its own outrages, issued a letter widely interpreted as a threat to attack London and Paris with nuclear weapons, the great powers seemed for an instant to be lurching toward World War III.'b'The turmoil and danger created by the Suez crisis and the Hungarian rebellion have largely faded from popular memory. With \xe2\x80\x9cBlood and Sand,\xe2\x80\x9d Alex von Tunzelmann, an Oxford-educated historian with an eye for human detail as well as a sure-handed grasp of the larger picture, does a marvelous job of recreating the tension and bungling that swept up Cairo, London, Moscow, Budapest, Paris and Washington during the harrowing two weeks of Oct. 22 to Nov. 6, 1956.'b'The background of the crisis was complex, and some readers may get slightly dizzy as the author corkscrews back in time from her gripping narrative. But the ultimate reward is a deeper understanding of the forces at work, as well as a wild ride down a zigzag trail left by the flailing of men with bloated and broken egos.'b'Von Tunzelmann begins her yarn with an arresting anecdote related by Anthony Nutting, a minister in the British Foreign Office. It was March 1956, and Nutting had been working on a plan to lessen the influence of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the charismatic president of postcolonial Egypt. Interrupted at dinner at the Savoy Hotel, Nutting took a call from Prime Minister Eden. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s all this nonsense about isolating Nasser or \xe2\x80\x98neutralizing\xe2\x80\x99 him, as you call it?\xe2\x80\x9d Eden said, shouting over the phone. \xe2\x80\x9cI want him murdered, can\xe2\x80\x99t you understand?\xe2\x80\x9d Nutting (in his own telling) began to protest but Eden insisted: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want an alternative. And I don\xe2\x80\x99t give a damn if there\xe2\x80\x99s anarchy and chaos in Egypt.\xe2\x80\x9d Then the prime minister hung up.'b'Eden is a tragic if rather unappealing figure in von Tunzelmann\xe2\x80\x99s account. Bred to his class at Eton and Oxford, he looked the part of a perfect gentleman. He took first-class honors in Persian and Arabic at Oxford, and during his career at the Foreign Office, he had shown sensitivity to the emergence of nationalism in the Middle East. He had served bravely on the Western Front in World War I and capably as Winston Churchill\xe2\x80\x99s foreign secretary during World War II.'b'But he was not well. \xe2\x80\x9cHis flashes of temper and fragile nerves led some to wonder about his genetic inheritance,\xe2\x80\x9d von Tunzelmann writes. \xe2\x80\x9cHis baronet father had been such an extreme eccentric \xe2\x80\x94 complete with episodes of \xe2\x80\x98uncontrolled rages,\xe2\x80\x99 falling to the floor, biting carpets and hurling flowerpots through plate-glass windows \xe2\x80\x94 that even the Wodehousian society of early-20th-century upper-class England had noticed something was up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As prime minister, Sir Anthony took to calling ministers in the middle of the night to ask if they had read a particular newspaper article. \xe2\x80\x9cMy nerves are already at breaking point,\xe2\x80\x9d he told his civil servants. In October 1956, he collapsed physically for a few days. According to one of his closest aides, he used amphetamines as well as heavy painkillers, and a Whitehall official said he was \xe2\x80\x9cpractically living on Benzedrine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He was obsessed with Egypt\xe2\x80\x99s Nasser, the leader of a group of nationalist army officers who had deposed the pro-British monarchy in 1952 and seized the British- and French-controlled Suez Canal in July 1956. About two-thirds of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s oil was transported through the canal; Nasser had his \xe2\x80\x9cthumb on our windpipe,\xe2\x80\x9d Eden fumed. Eden made Nasser \xe2\x80\x9ca scapegoat for all his problems: the sinking empire, the sluggish economy, the collapse of his reputation within his party and his dwindling popularity in the country at large,\xe2\x80\x9d von Tunzelmann writes. Resentment sharpened into vendetta. Over the summer and fall, Eden concocted a cockamamie scheme, called Operation Musketeer, to stage an Israeli invasion of Egypt, followed by an Anglo-French peacekeeping force for the \xe2\x80\x9cprotection\xe2\x80\x9d of the canal. The Israeli and French conspirators had their own foolish reasons for going along; significantly, the United States was kept in the dark.'b'Fortunately, when the crisis broke, Eden\xe2\x80\x99s recklessness was foiled by the calm resolve of the American president, Dwight Eisenhower. Genial in public and so fond of golf that he installed a putting green outside the Oval Office, Eisenhower was easy to underestimate. But having liberated Western Europe as supreme allied commander and seen firsthand the waste of war, he was determined as president to keep the United States out of armed conflict. He also had an \xe2\x80\x9cinstinctive sympathy with the postcolonial predicament,\xe2\x80\x9d von Tunzelmann writes.'b'Eisenhower was not always well served by the rhetoric of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles or the machinations of his brother, Allen Dulles, the director of central intelligence. And Eisenhower had a temper. \xe2\x80\x9cBombs, by God,\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted when the British began striking Egyptian air fields. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat does Anthony think he\xe2\x80\x99s doing? Why is he doing this to me?\xe2\x80\x9d But Eisenhower was shrewd and he could be coldly calculating. Understanding that the British would need to buy American oil, he quietly put Britain into a financial squeeze, forcing Eden to back off the invasion.'b'Eisenhower was also, unusually for an American president, willing to say no to Israel. The Suez crisis blew up just as America went to the polls to vote on a second term for the president. His staff secretary, Andrew Goodpaster, recorded: \xe2\x80\x9cIn this matter, he does not care in the slightest whether he is re-elected or not. He feels we must make good on our word [to defend Egypt]. He added that he did not really think the American people would throw him out in the middle of a situation like this, but if they did, so be it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When others were losing their heads, Eisenhower kept his. Though never explicitly stated, the take-away from von Tunzelmann\xe2\x80\x99s book is obvious: When it comes to national leadership in chaotic times, temperament matters. Which makes her book not only exciting and satisfying but also timely.'b''b'Evan Thomas, the author of \xe2\x80\x9cIke\xe2\x80\x99s Bluff\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBeing Nixon,\xe2\x80\x9d is working on an authorized biography of Sandra Day O\xe2\x80\x99Connor.'b''b'In Bookends, two writers take on questions about the world of books. This week, Charles McGrath and Siddhartha Deb debate which classic dystopian vision rings truest at the beginning of 2017: George Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c1984\xe2\x80\x9d or Aldous Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'By Charles McGrath'b''b''b'Was Orwell right after all? Not yet. Trump would be much more comfortable in Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s world.'b''b'A month ago I would have said that not only is \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World\xe2\x80\x9d a livelier, more entertaining book than \xe2\x80\x9c1984,\xe2\x80\x9d it\xe2\x80\x99s also a more prescient one. Orwell didn\xe2\x80\x99t really have much feel for the future, which to his mind was just another version of the present. His imagined London is merely a drabber, more joyless version of the city, still recovering from the Blitz, where he was living in the mid-1940s, just before beginning the novel. The main technological advancement there is the two-way telescreen, essentially an electronic peephole.'b'Huxley, on the other hand, writing almost two decades earlier than Orwell (his former Eton pupil, as it happened), foresaw a world that included space travel; private helicopters; genetically engineered test tube babies; enhanced birth control; an immensely popular drug that appears to combine the best features of Valium and Ecstasy; hormone-laced chewing gum that seems to work the way Viagra does; a full sensory entertainment system that outdoes IMAX; and maybe even breast implants. (The book is a little unclear on this point, but in \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World\xe2\x80\x9d the highest compliment you can pay a woman is to call her \xe2\x80\x9cpneumatic.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Huxley was not entirely serious about this. He began \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World\xe2\x80\x9d as a parody of H.G. Wells, whose writing he detested, and it remained a book that means to be as playful as it is prophetic. And yet his novel much more accurately evokes the country we live in now, especially in its depiction of a culture preoccupied with sex and mindless pop entertainment, than does Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s more ominous book, which seems to be imagining someplace like North Korea.'b'Or it did until Donald Trump was inaugurated. All of a sudden, as many commentators have pointed out, there were almost daily echoes of Orwell in the news, and \xe2\x80\x9c1984\xe2\x80\x9d began shooting up the Amazon best-seller list. The most obvious connection to Orwell was the new president\xe2\x80\x99s repeated insistence that even his most pointless and transparent lies were in fact true, and then his adviser Kellyanne Conway\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that these statements were not really falsehoods but, rather, \xe2\x80\x9calternative facts.\xe2\x80\x9d As any reader of \xe2\x80\x9c1984\xe2\x80\x9d knows, this is exactly Big Brother\xe2\x80\x99s standard of truth: The facts are whatever the leader says they are. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a rereader, thumbing through your old Penguin paperback, those endless wars in \xe2\x80\x9c1984,\xe2\x80\x9d during which the enemy keeps changing \xe2\x80\x94 now Eurasia, now Eastasia \xe2\x80\x94 no longer seem as far-fetched as they once did, and neither do the book\xe2\x80\x99s organized hate rallies, in which the citizenry works itself into a frenzy against nameless foreigners. Even President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s weirdly impoverished, 12-year-old\xe2\x80\x99s vocabulary has an analogue in \xe2\x80\x9c1984,\xe2\x80\x9d in which Newspeak isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the medium of double talk; it\xe2\x80\x99s a language busily trying to shed itself of as many words (and as much complexity) as possible.'b'So was Orwell right after all? Well, not yet. For one thing, the political system of \xe2\x80\x9c1984\xe2\x80\x9d is an exaggerated version of anticapitalist, Stalin-era Communism, and Trump\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy is anything but that. He would be much more comfortable in Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s world, which is based on rampant consumerism and where hordes of genetically modified losers happily tend to the needs of the winners.'b'Huxley believed that his version of dystopia was the more plausible one. In a 1949 letter, thanking Orwell for sending him a copy of \xe2\x80\x9c1984,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote that he really didn\xe2\x80\x99t think all that torture and jackbooting was necessary to subdue a population, and that he believed his own book offered a better solution. All you need to do, he said, is teach people to love their servitude. The totalitarian rulers in Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s book do this not by oppressing their citizens but by giving them exactly what they want, or what they think they want \xe2\x80\x94 which is basically sex, drugs and rock \xe2\x80\x99n\xe2\x80\x99 roll \xe2\x80\x94 and lulling them into complacency. The system entails a certain Trump-like suspicion of science and dismissal of history, but that\xe2\x80\x99s a price the inhabitants of Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s world happily pay. They don\xe2\x80\x99t mourn their lost liberty, the way Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s Winston Smith does; they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know it\xe2\x80\x99s gone.'b''b''b'Charles McGrath'b' was the editor of the Book Review from 1995 to 2004, and is now a contributing writer for The Times.

There is much in Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s novel, in fact, that translates poorly into the contemporary moment. From its texture of material deprivation, the loosely packed cigarettes and boiled cabbages recalling wartime rationing in Britain, to its portrayal of Ingsoc, Big Brother and various Ministries (Truth, Peace, Love, Plenty), all of which assume control by a heavily centralized State, it is a work very much of the \xe2\x80\x9940s as experienced by an English intellectual.'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cAmusing Ourselves to Death,\xe2\x80\x9d the American media critic Neil Postman in fact argued that Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s novel was far more relevant than Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s when it came to the United States, where the dominant mode of control over people was through entertainment, distraction, and superficial pleasure rather than through overt modes of policing and strict control over food supplies, at least when it came to managing the middle classes. Three decades after Postman\xe2\x80\x99s account, when we can add reality television, the internet and social media to the deadly amusements available, \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World\xe2\x80\x9d can still seem strikingly relevant in its depiction of the relentless pursuit of pleasure. From the use of soma as a kind of happiness drug to the erasure of the past not so much as a threat to government, as is the case in Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s dystopia, but as simply irrelevant (\xe2\x80\x9cHistory is bunk\xe2\x80\x9d), Huxley marked out amusement and superficiality as the buttons that control behavior.'b'His relentless focus on the body, too, seems inspired, his understanding of what Michel Foucault identified as \xe2\x80\x9cbiopolitics,\xe2\x80\x9d extending to the individual body as well as to entire populations and, in \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World,\xe2\x80\x9d playing out as a eugenic system based on caste, class, race, looks and size. As for his depiction of the \xe2\x80\x9csavage reservation\xe2\x80\x9d in New Mexico, this seems to foreshadow the fetishization of the natural on the part of one of the most artifice-ridden populations in the history of the world.'b'A great deal funnier, subtler and darker than Orwell\xe2\x80\x99s book, Huxley\xe2\x80\x99s satire nevertheless has its limitations. A World State? Games of escalator squash? In any case, why stop at one of two books, as if the literary realm must mimic the denuded, lesser-of-two-evils choices of electoral politics?

His publicity tours usually started at the Galaxy Bookshop in Hardwick, Vt., where he would read from his newest book or give a slide show, which sometimes featured a picture of Mr. Mosher blasting a negative newspaper review with his shotgun. His last appearance at the store, in 2015, attracted such a crowd that it had to be moved to a nearby opera house.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe real drama and the real entertainment came when he talked about what inspired his books,\xe2\x80\x9d Sandy Scott, a co-owner of the bookstore, said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s when his personality came out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mo Willems and Oliver Jeffers \xe2\x80\x94 two of the most beloved, and singular, creators of children\xe2\x80\x99s picture books working today \xe2\x80\x94 have both seen their literary creations head to the stage.

The two authors talked to Maria Russo, The Times\xe2\x80\x99s children\xe2\x80\x99s books editor, about the thrills and embarrassments of children\xe2\x80\x99s theater and their books\xe2\x80\x99 very different journeys to the stage. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.'b''b'Mo, you were very involved in the play, writing the script and participating all along. Oliver, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even see this production based on your book until it was a done deal. Can you each talk about those different approaches?'b''b''b'MO WILLEMS'b' This show grew out of a healthy relationship with the Kennedy Center. They\xe2\x80\x99d already done \xe2\x80\x9cKnuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Musical,\xe2\x80\x9d based on my books, and that experience was really, really great. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got another in the works too. Now I hope to be doing a play every couple of years, because it\xe2\x80\x99s the opposite of books. Books are really not collaborative, but with theater you get all these actors, they bring something to the table, you can steal it and pretend like it\xe2\x80\x99s yours \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s really fun!'b''b'OLIVER JEFFERS'b' I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I know very much about theater. Mo, you\xe2\x80\x99ve been on the stage a little bit. Some of the adaptations of my books that have been on film \xe2\x80\x94 short films \xe2\x80\x94 I\xe2\x80\x99ve been much more involved with, because I feel comfortable in that arena. Acting is never something I have ever aspired to do. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got a lot of friends who are talented actors, so I really know I personally am not one. But it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting; my work takes shape in many different forms \xe2\x80\x94 filmmaking, sculpture, whatever. And the live theater stage never occurred to me until I saw this piece and could see the potential, the inner beauty of what you could do there. It\xe2\x80\x99s a different thing, so different from the book.'b''b'WILLEMS:'b' It\xe2\x80\x99s temporary. It completely disappears; it vaporizes at the end of each performance. Each one is this great dialogue with a particular group of kids.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' And it\xe2\x80\x99s different every time.'b''b'WILLEMS:'b' This play, \xe2\x80\x9cElephant &amp; Piggie,\xe2\x80\x9d is basically Ionesco \xe2\x80\x94 the kids are just not old enough to realize they should be intimidated by that. You\xe2\x80\x99re writing a piece that should be performed and performed well, but it also should be able to be scaled down . . . even in terms of ability. The songs have to be just singable. The set and design have to be able to travel.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' Did you write the music?'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' I wrote the lyrics, but I worked with a composer. We came up with a list of songs I liked and genres, and I hummed into a tape player. That melody was taken away immediately \xe2\x80\x94 it was horrible \xe2\x80\x94 but they got a sense of the core emotion I was trying to get across. At the point at which you can\xe2\x80\x99t remember who contributed what to the song, that\xe2\x80\x99s when it\xe2\x80\x99s done.'b''b'And \xe2\x80\x9cThe Way Back Home\xe2\x80\x9d is the exact opposite of a musical \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s completely silent, done with puppets in a black-box stage.'b''b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' Oliver\xe2\x80\x99s books probably have more words than mine do, so that\xe2\x80\x99s interesting. You know, children\xe2\x80\x99s theater and picture books are in many ways going for the same thing, so it\xe2\x80\x99s a shame children\xe2\x80\x99s theater doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a better reputation. When you say, \xe2\x80\x9cI write children\xe2\x80\x99s books,\xe2\x80\x9d people say, \xe2\x80\x9cOOOOHH!\xe2\x80\x9d When you say, \xe2\x80\x9cI write children\xe2\x80\x99s theater,\xe2\x80\x9d they say, \xe2\x80\x9cUuuuhhh. . . .\xe2\x80\x9d Because, you know, they\xe2\x80\x99re worried there will be balloons involved.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' Would you say it\xe2\x80\x99s more accessible, easier to put on a production than it is to, say, self-publish a book? Maybe that contributes to the reputation of children\xe2\x80\x99s theater. The range of quality can be much greater.'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' I also think there\xe2\x80\x99s some really great-quality children\xe2\x80\x99s theater and people don\xe2\x80\x99t quite realize it, in the way that 20 years ago they didn\xe2\x80\x99t realize it with picture books.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' Especially in the fine art world \xe2\x80\x94 when I was fresh out of college, if you ever mentioned you were doing picture books \xe2\x80\x94 no.'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' Or it was like, Well you gotta pay the bills! It\xe2\x80\x99s better than working as a waiter.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' But that\xe2\x80\x99s totally changed. And maybe in 20 years it will be the same for children\xe2\x80\x99s theater. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing theater has that books do not, it\xe2\x80\x99s the ability to control time. We have no say about how long someone spends on a page, but with theater, you can hold someone in a moment as long as you choose to. You can make it slow or fast.'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' True. Also interesting about theater: In this show, there\xe2\x80\x99s a scene in which Elephant Gerald is deciding whether he should share the ice cream or not. And I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that when the school groups come, the kids yell: \xe2\x80\x9cNOOOO! Are you kidding?\xe2\x80\x9d But then when they come with their grandparents, they say, \xe2\x80\x9cYes, share the ice cream!\xe2\x80\x9d Because the kids also know who they\xe2\x80\x99re performing to!'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' And you know, it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t occurred to them that they can leave the theater yet. That they can walk out.'b''b'In the \xe2\x80\x9cElephant &amp; Piggie\xe2\x80\x9d play, there\xe2\x80\x99s that moment when Gerald and Piggie look out at the audience and realize they\xe2\x80\x99re in a play, and it blows the kids\xe2\x80\x99 minds.'b''b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' They\xe2\x80\x99ve been there at that point 40 minutes \xe2\x80\x94 so it\xe2\x80\x99s really a shocking \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d moment. You discover two-thirds of the way through a piece, just like you discover two-thirds through your life, that you have agency! And kids\xe2\x80\x99 honesty is really \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' Unnerving!'b''b'Watching the audience experience \xe2\x80\x9cThe Way Back Home\xe2\x80\x9d was interesting too. Since there were no sounds coming from the stage, you could hear the kids in the audience saying, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is he doing?\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cIs that his bed?\xe2\x80\x9d and just feeling their way through it by talking.'b''b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' I\xe2\x80\x99ve been to see it a couple of times, and once there was complete silence, but the other time the kids were much more caught up in talking. It was two totally random audiences. I think once the verbal engagement begins, it\xe2\x80\x99s a seal of approval for all the other kids. It sort of spreads and grows, the collective personality of an audience. And it does change the nature of the play. A friend of mine who\xe2\x80\x99s an actor says a Saturday night audience is different from a Tuesday night audience \xe2\x80\x94 the Saturday night audience expects to be entertained; they\xe2\x80\x99re like \xe2\x80\x9cThis better be good!\xe2\x80\x9d While Tuesday night they\xe2\x80\x99re just happy to be out of the house.'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' The audience is just a bunch of strangers, but they\xe2\x80\x99re communicating as well. It\xe2\x80\x99s magic. And what\xe2\x80\x99s so great about it is that it\xe2\x80\x99s impermanent; you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to document it, you just experience it. You can\xe2\x80\x99t ever relive it. You can only relive the feeling you had.'b''b'Does having had these theater versions of your work out in the world inform how you approach making a picture book now?'b''b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' To me, the process of making a book is not unlike making a film, but the process of theater is just so unlike all that. The lack of control in the collaboration, the blocking for time, the restricted space. . . . I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that translates to books. But with film, when the scene changes and when the page changes, the way you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at it is similar, whether you\xe2\x80\x99re above, up close, beside. . . .'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' I come from writing sketch, and I structure my books in a sketch structure. But I would think of the books in terms of animation before a play.'b''b'What else have you learned from the theater experiences?'b''b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' Adapting to the stage is always interesting, because you discover things. You have to fill time with what you\xe2\x80\x99ve written, and you might realize that what you\xe2\x80\x99ve done in the book may have some meat that you didn\xe2\x80\x99t even anticipate.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' I think good stories are good stories, and the platform changes.'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' They\xe2\x80\x99re apples and elephants. For me the biggest thing is to go from being mostly solo to being super collaborative. It\xe2\x80\x99s nice to stretch different muscles that way.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' It comes down to trust and mutual respect.'b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' And time! When I worked in television, there was some money but no time. And in theater, there\xe2\x80\x99s no money, but there\xe2\x80\x99s time. So you can write the piece and come back to it six months later and workshop it over a week. There\xe2\x80\x99s all this time to let things marinate.'b''b'That\xe2\x80\x99s one way theater is more like books than film is.'b''b''b'WILLEMS'b''b':'b' And that\xe2\x80\x99s why I much prefer theater over film or television. Time is an element, you get to be with people you trust and come back in a few months and revisit.'b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' Normally when I\xe2\x80\x99m making a book, I\xe2\x80\x99m in the feeling, and I keep going to the end. Maybe I go back and review what I did. I recently collaborated on a book called \xe2\x80\x9cA Child of Books\xe2\x80\x9d with my friend Sam Winston. We were forced to take pockets of time as we sent the work back and forth, and it changed everything.'b''b'Do you think you might get more involved in future theater productions of your books, Oliver?'b''b''b'JEFFERS'b''b':'b' A production of my book \xe2\x80\x9cLost and Found\xe2\x80\x9d is being discussed with a company in England. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. . . .'b''b'WILLEMS:'b' I would encourage you to be involved. It\xe2\x80\x99s great. And it might just change how you work later, being in that collaborative space.'b''b'WHITE RAGE'b''b''b'The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide'b''b'By Carol Anderson'b'246 pp. Bloomsbury. $26.'b''b''b''b'As the Obama presidency draws to a close, it is clear that the post-racial democracy it was supposed to inaugurate has not materialized. But over the last eight years something very important has emerged in the way race gets discussed in America: the foregrounding of whiteness. From discussions of diversity on campus and white appropriation of black culture to #OscarsSoWhite, \xe2\x80\x9cwhiteness\xe2\x80\x9d as a cultural and social category has become a subject for scrutiny and criticism in ways that \xe2\x80\x9cblackness\xe2\x80\x9d was in years past.'b'Unfortunately, this reversal of perspective has tended to seize on the shallower ways in which whiteness functions in American life. To see the full picture, whiteness must be understood in light of our national history, specifically the use of state power to engineer preferential treatment for whites and deliberately impose cumulative disadvantage on blacks. Carol Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s new book, \xe2\x80\x9cWhite Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide,\xe2\x80\x9d brings such a historical context sharply back into focus. This book is an extraordinarily timely and urgent call to confront the legacy of structural racism bequeathed by white anger and resentment, and to show its continuing threat to the promise of American democracy.'b'In August 2014, as the headlines from Ferguson focused on the eruption of black rage, Anderson, a professor of African-\xc2\xadAmerican studies at Emory University, wrote a dissenting op-ed in The Washington Post arguing that the events were better understood as white backlash at a moment of black progress, a social and political pattern that she reminded readers was as old as the nation itself. Her essay became the kernel for this book, which expands and illustrates her thesis. \xe2\x80\x9cI set out to make white rage visible,\xe2\x80\x9d Anderson writes in her introduction, \xe2\x80\x9cto blow graphite onto that hidden fingerprint and trace its historic movements over the past 150 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This time frame takes us back to Reconstruction, that tragic decade in the wake of the Civil War, which is where Anderson picks up her narrative. \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica was at the crossroads,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes, \xe2\x80\x9cbetween its slaveholding past and the possibility of a truly inclusive, vibrant democracy.\xe2\x80\x9d She chooses to highlight President Andrew Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive opposition to the enfranchisement of black Americans. She also details the horrors of paramilitary terrorism waged by the Klan and its affiliates. But we get only sketches here of the wide and brutal conflict in which Reconstruction \xe2\x80\x9cwas overthrown, with impunity and audacity, in one of the bloodiest, darkest and still least-known chapters in American history,\xe2\x80\x9d which is how Stephen Budiansky put it in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bloody Shirt: Terror After Appomattox\xe2\x80\x9d (2008). With the Hayes-Tilden Compromise of 1877, Southern Democrats agreed to support Rutherford B. Hayes\xe2\x80\x99s claim to the presidency in exchange for an end to Reconstruction \xe2\x80\x94 a collusion that plunged the South back into white supremacy.'b'Against these depredations blacks sought the protection of the Constitution. Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s book is particularly acute in recalling the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s shameful role in repeatedly denying that relief, and in securing and ratifying the legal apartheid we know as Jim Crow.'b'Like a series of tableaus by Jacob Lawrence, Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s survey links scenes that should be familiar to us, yet somehow keep falling by the wayside in the story of America we tell: There are the boxcars full of sharecroppers fleeing the South; the bellowing declarations of massive resistance to school integration after Brown v. Board of Education; the \xe2\x80\x9cSouthern strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s playbook for using white anger over the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, enshrining race-baiting as a political maneuver; the Reagan administration\xe2\x80\x99s machinations in the so-called War on Drugs; the vitriolic hatred directed at Barack Obama.'b'Why has white rage been such a feature of American life? Anderson doesn\xe2\x80\x99t offer an answer; her book is a historical catalog of white backlash \xe2\x80\x94 not a theory about its origins. In a move that seems at once tactful and tactical, she sidesteps the wearying debate among progressives over the competing priorities of class and identity politics, preferring to highlight the danger posed by a force that erupts at moments of progress to thwart the advance of democracy and racial equality.'b'Anderson\xe2\x80\x99s epilogue brings her account to the bloody steps of Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C., and the rising star of Donald Trump. In her closing lines, she calls on us to \xe2\x80\x9cchoose a different future.\xe2\x80\x9d As the rough beast slouches towards November, one prays that we still can.'b'Over the last year, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been plunged into the alternate reality of Trumpland, as though we were caught in the maze of his old board game, \xe2\x80\x9cTrump: The Game,\xe2\x80\x9d with no exit in sight. It\xe2\x80\x99s a Darwinian, dog-eat-dog, zero-sum world where greed is good, insults are the lingua franca, and winning is everything (or, in tangled Trumpian syntax, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not whether you win or lose, but whether you win!\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'To read a stack of new and reissued books about Mr. Trump, as well as a bunch of his own works, is to be plunged into a kind of Bizarro World version of Dante\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cInferno,\xe2\x80\x9d where arrogance, acquisitiveness and the sowing of discord are not sins, but attributes of leadership; a place where lies, contradictions and outrageous remarks spring up in such thickets that the sort of moral exhaustion associated with bad soap operas quickly threatens to ensue.'b'That the subject of these books is not a fictional character but the Republican nominee for president can only remind the reader of Philip Roth\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'observation'b', made more than 50 years ago, that American reality is so stupefying, \xe2\x80\x9cso weird and astonishing,\xe2\x80\x9d that it poses an embarrassment to the novelist\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmeager imagination.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Books about Mr. Trump tend to fall into two categories. There are funny ones that focus on Trump the Celebrity of the 1980s and \xe2\x80\x9990s \xe2\x80\x94 a cartoony avatar of greed and wretched excess and what Garry Trudeau (\xe2\x80\x9cYuge! 30 Years of Doonesbury on Trump\xe2\x80\x9d) calls \xe2\x80\x9cbig, honking hubris.\xe2\x80\x9d And there are serious biographies that try to shed light on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s life and complex, highly opaque business dealings as a real estate magnate, which are vital to understanding the judgment, decision-making abilities and financial entanglements he would bring to the Oval Office.'b'Because of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s lack of transparency surrounding his business interests (he has even declined to disclose his tax returns) and because of his loose handling of facts and love of hyperbole, serious books are obligated to spend a lot of time sifting through business and court documents. (USA Today recently reported that there are \xe2\x80\x9cabout 3,500 legal actions involving Trump, including 1,900 where he or his companies were a plaintiff and about 1,300 in which he was the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d) And they must also fact-check his assertions (PolitiFact rates 35 percent of his statements False, and 18 percent \xe2\x80\x9cPants on Fire\xe2\x80\x9d Lies).'b'Perhaps because they were written rapidly as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s presidential candidacy gained traction, the latest of these books rarely step back to analyze in detail the larger implications and repercussions of the Trump phenomenon. Nor do they really map the landscape in which he has risen to popularity and is himself reshaping through his carelessness with facts, polarizing remarks and disregard for political rules.'b'For that matter, these books shed little new light on controversial stands taken by Mr. Trump which, many legal scholars and historians note, threaten constitutional guarantees and American democratic traditions. Those include his call for \xe2\x80\x9ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cextreme vetting\xe2\x80\x9d of immigrants; his talk of revising libel laws to make it easier to sue news organizations over critical coverage; an ethnic-tinged attack on a federal judge that raises questions about his commitment to an independent judiciary; and his incendiary use of nativist and bigoted language that is fueling racial tensions and helping to mainstream far-right views on race.'b'Some of these books touch fleetingly on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s use of inflammatory language and emotional appeal to feelings of fear and anger, but they do not delve deeply into the consequences of his nativist rhetoric or his contempt for the rules of civil discourse. They do, however, provide some sense of history, reminding us that while Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s craving for attention and use of controversy as an instrument of publicity have remained the same over the years, the surreal switch of venues \xe2\x80\x94 from the New York tabloid universe and the world of reality TV to the real-life arena of national and global politics \xe2\x80\x94 has turned formerly \xe2\x80\x9csmall-potatoes stakes,\xe2\x80\x9d as one writer put it, into something profoundly more troubling. From WrestleMania-like insults aimed at fellow celebrities, Mr. Trump now denigrates whole racial and religious groups and questions the legitimacy of the electoral system.'b'A \xe2\x80\x9csemi-harmless buffoon\xe2\x80\x9d in Manhattan in the waning decades of the 20th century \xe2\x80\x94 as the editor of The New Yorker, David Remnick, terms the businessman in a foreword to Mark Singer\xe2\x80\x99s book \xe2\x80\x9cTrump and Me\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 has metamorphosed into a political candidate whom 50 senior Republican national security officials recently said \xe2\x80\x9cwould be the most reckless president in American history,\xe2\x80\x9d putting \xe2\x80\x9cat risk our country\xe2\x80\x99s national security and well being.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Two new books provide useful, vigorously reported overviews of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s life and career. \xe2\x80\x9cTrump Revealed,\xe2\x80\x9d by Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher of The Washington Post, draws heavily on work by reporters of The Post and more than 20 hours of interviews with the candidate. Much of its material will be familiar to readers \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to newspaper articles and Michael D\xe2\x80\x99Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 biography (\xe2\x80\x9cNever Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x94 but \xe2\x80\x9cTrump Revealed\xe2\x80\x9d deftly charts his single-minded building of his gaudy brand and his often masterful manipulation of the media.'b'It provides a succinct account of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s childhood, when he says he punched a teacher, giving him a black eye. It also recounts his apprenticeship to a demanding father, who told him he needed to become a \xe2\x80\x9ckiller\xe2\x80\x9d in anything he did, and how he learned the art of the counterattack from Roy Cohn, Joseph McCarthy\xe2\x80\x99s former right-hand man, whom Mr. Trump hired to countersue the federal government after the Justice Department brought a case against the Trump family firm in 1973 for violating the Fair Housing Act.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Making of Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x9d by David Cay Johnston \xe2\x80\x94 a former reporter for The New York Times who has written extensively about Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x94 zeros in on Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s business practices, arguing that while he presents himself as \xe2\x80\x9ca modern Midas,\xe2\x80\x9d much \xe2\x80\x9cof what he touches\xe2\x80\x9d has often turned \xe2\x80\x9cto dross.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Johnston, who has followed the real estate impresario for nearly three decades, offers a searing indictment of his business practices and creative accounting. He examines Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s taste for debt, what associates have described as his startling capacity for recklessness, multiple corporate bankruptcies, dealings with reputed mobsters and accusations of fraud.'b'The portrait of Mr. Trump that emerges from these books, old or new, serious or satirical, is remarkably consistent: a high-decibel narcissist, almost comically self-obsessed; a \xe2\x80\x9chyperbole addict who prevaricates for fun and profit,\xe2\x80\x9d as Mr. Singer wrote in The New Yorker in 1997.'b'Mr. Singer also describes Mr. Trump as an \xe2\x80\x9cinsatiable publicity hound who courts the press on a daily basis and, when he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like what he reads, attacks the messengers as \xe2\x80\x98human garbage,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca fellow both slippery and na\xc3\xafve, artfully calculating and recklessly heedless of consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the same time, Mr. Singer and other writers discern an emptiness underneath the gold-plated armor. In \xe2\x80\x9cTrump and Me,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Singer describes his subject as a man \xe2\x80\x9cwho had aspired to and achieved the ultimate luxury, an existence unmolested by the rumbling of a soul.\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Kranish and Mr. Fisher likewise suggest that Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x9chad walled off\xe2\x80\x9d any pain he experienced growing up and \xe2\x80\x9chid it behind a never-ending show about himself.\xe2\x80\x9d When they ask him about friends, they write, he gives them \xe2\x80\x94 off the record \xe2\x80\x94 the names of three men \xe2\x80\x9che had had business dealings with two or more decades before, men he had only rarely seen in recent years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Trump likes to boast about going it alone \xe2\x80\x94 an impulse that helps explain the rapid turnover among advisers in his campaign, and that has raised serious concerns among national security experts and foreign policy observers, who note that his extreme self-reliance and certainty (\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain\xe2\x80\x9d) come coupled with a startling ignorance about global affairs and an impatience with policy and details.'b'Passages in his books help illuminate Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s admiration for the strongman style of autocratic leaders like Russia\xe2\x80\x99s Vladimir V. Putin, and his own astonishing \xe2\x80\x9cI alone can fix it\xe2\x80\x9d moment during his Republican convention speech. In his 2004 book, \xe2\x80\x9cThink Like a Billionaire,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Trump wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must plan and execute your plan alone.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He also advised: \xe2\x80\x9cHave a short attention span,\xe2\x80\x9d adding \xe2\x80\x9cquite often, I\xe2\x80\x99ll be talking to someone and I\xe2\x80\x99ll know what they\xe2\x80\x99re going to say before they say it. After the first three words are out of their mouth, I can tell what the next 40 are going to be, so I try to pick up the pace and move it along. You can get more done faster that way.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In many respects, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s own quotes and writings provide the most vivid and alarming picture of his values, modus operandi and relentlessly dark outlook focused on revenge. \xe2\x80\x9cBe paranoid,\xe2\x80\x9d he advises in one book. And in another: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen somebody screws you, screw them back in spades.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The grim, dystopian view of America, articulated in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Republican convention speech, is previewed in his 2015 book, \xe2\x80\x9cCrippled America\xe2\x80\x9d (republished with the cheerier title of \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Again: How to Fix Our Crippled America\xe2\x80\x9d), in which he contends that \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone is eating\xe2\x80\x9d America\xe2\x80\x99s lunch. And a similarly nihilistic vision surfaces in other remarks he\xe2\x80\x99s made over the years: \xe2\x80\x9cI always get even\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cFor the most part, you can\xe2\x80\x99t respect people because most people aren\xe2\x80\x99t worthy of respect\xe2\x80\x9d; and: \xe2\x80\x9cThe world is a horrible place. Lions kill for food, but people kill for sport.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Once upon a time, such remarks made Mr. Trump perfect fodder for comedians. Though some writers noted that he was already a caricature of a caricature \xe2\x80\x94 difficult to parody or satirize \xe2\x80\x94 Mr. Trudeau recalled that he provided cartoonists with \xe2\x80\x9can embarrassment of follies.\xe2\x80\x9d And the businessman, who seems to live by the conviction that any publicity is good publicity, apparently embraced this celebrity, writing: \xe2\x80\x9cMy cartoon is real. I am the creator of my own comic book.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In a 1990 cartoon, Doonesbury characters argued over what they disliked more about Mr. Trump: \xe2\x80\x9cthe boasting, the piggish consumption\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cthe hideous d\xc3\xa9cor of his casinos.\xe2\x80\x9d Sadly, the stakes today are infinitely so much huger.'b''b'Follow Michiko Kakutani on Twitter: 'b'@michikokakutani'b''b''b''b'STRANGERS IN THEIR OWN LAND'b''b''b'Anger and Mourning on the American Right'b''b'By Arlie Russell Hochschild'b'351 pp. The New Press. $27.95.'b''b''b''b'Arlie Hochschild\xe2\x80\x99s generous but disconcerting look at the Tea Party presents a likable fellow named Lee Sherman, who once worked for a Louisiana chemical plant where his duties included illegally dumping toxic waste into the bayou.'b'Sherman did the dirty work; then the company did him dirty. After 15 years on the job, he was doused with chemicals that \xe2\x80\x9cburned my clothes clean off me\xe2\x80\x9d and left him ill. But rather than pay his disability costs, his bosses accused him of absenteeism and fired him.'b'Sherman became a fledgling environmentalist and got his revenge after a giant fish kill threatened the livelihood of nearby fishermen. Company officials feigned innocence, but Sherman barged into a public meeting with an incriminating sign: I\xe2\x80\x99M THE ONE WHO DUMPED IT IN THE BAYOU. Fast-forward a couple of decades and Sherman, still an environmentalist, is campaigning for a Tea Party congressman who wants to gut the Environmental Protection Agency. Sherman still distrusts chemical companies, but he distrusts the federal government more, because it spends his tax money on people who \xe2\x80\x9clazed around days and partied at night.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In \xe2\x80\x9cStrangers in Their Own Land,\xe2\x80\x9d which has been 'b'nominated for a National Book Award'b', Hochschild calls this the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat Paradox\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 opposition to federal help from people and places that need it \xe2\x80\x94 and sets off across Louisiana on an energetic, open-minded quest to understand it.'b'A distinguished Berkeley sociologist, Hochschild is a woman of the left, but her mission is empathy, not polemics. She takes seriously the Tea Partiers\xe2\x80\x99 complaints that they have become the \xe2\x80\x9cstrangers\xe2\x80\x9d of the title \xe2\x80\x94 triply marginalized by flat or falling wages, rapid demographic change, and liberal culture that mocks their faith and patriotism. Her affection for her characters is palpable.'b'But the resentments she finds are as toxic as the pollutants in the marsh and metastasizing throughout politics. What unites her subjects is the powerful feeling that others are \xe2\x80\x9ccutting in line\xe2\x80\x9d and that the federal government is supporting people on the dole \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ctaking money from the workers and giving it to the idle.\xe2\x80\x9d Income is flowing up, but the anger points down.'b'The people who feel this are white. The usurpers they picture are blacks and immigrants. Hochschild takes care not to call anyone racist but concludes that \xe2\x80\x9crace is an essential part of this story.\xe2\x80\x9d When she asks a small-town mayor to describe his politics, his first two issues \xe2\x80\x94 or is it one in his mind? \xe2\x80\x94 are welfare and race: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the government paying unwed mothers to have a lot of kids, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t go for affirmative action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In welfare politics, this is d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu all over again. It\xe2\x80\x99s been two decades since Bill Clinton signed a tough welfare law aimed in part to end the politics of blame. \xe2\x80\x9cEnding welfare as we know it\xe2\x80\x9d would recast the needy as workers, he said, and build support for a new safety net. The rolls of the main federal cash program have fallen by 80 percent from their 1990s highs \xe2\x80\x94 in Louisiana, by 95 percent. But reverse class anger is more potent than ever.'b'Liberals have long wondered why \xc2\xadworking-class voters support policies that (the liberals think) hurt the working class. Why would victims of pollution side with the polluters?'b'Theories abound. Thomas Frank accuses the G.O.P. of luring voters with social issues but delivering tax cuts for the rich. Others point to the political machines built by ultra-wealthy donors like Charles and David Koch. Still others emphasize the influence of conservative media like Fox News.'b'Hochschild sees these as partial explanations but wants a fuller understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cemotion in politics\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 she wants to know how Tea Partiers feel, on the theory that the movement serves their \xe2\x80\x9cemotional self-interest\xe2\x80\x9d by providing \xe2\x80\x9ca giddy release\xe2\x80\x9d from years of frustration.'b'Six characters dominate the book, including Harold Areno, who lives on a swamp so polluted even the rugged cypress trees are dead. He and his wife have had cancer. Yet Areno supports politicians hostile to environmental regulation because he cares more about banning abortion. \xe2\x80\x9cWe vote for candidates that put the Bible where it belongs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Mike Schaff lost his neighborhood to the Bayou Corne sinkhole, which started to swallow 37 acres in 2012 after a lightly regulated drilling company punctured an underground salt dome.

The resentments Hochschild presents are unadorned, and they have mutated into a broader suspicion of almost everything the federal government does. \xe2\x80\x9cThe government has gone rogue, corrupt, malicious and ugly,\xe2\x80\x9d one Tea Partier complains. \xe2\x80\x9cIt can\xe2\x80\x99t help anybody.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Did welfare really \xe2\x80\x9cend\xe2\x80\x9d? Conservatives say no. Cash aid plummeted, but food stamp usage soared to new highs and the Medicaid rolls expanded. There\xe2\x80\x99s room for debate, but the grievances Hochschild presents feel immune to policy solutions. As long as larger forces are squeezing whites of modest means, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to \xe2\x80\x9cfeel as if\xe2\x80\x9d people are cutting in line. In Lexuses.'b'None of Hochschild\xe2\x80\x99s characters appear to have been directly hurt by competition from people of color. Their economic problems lie elsewhere, she argues, in unchecked corporate power and technological transformation. Still there\xe2\x80\x99s no denying that demographic and cultural change have robbed white men of the status they once enjoyed. Hochschild doesn\xe2\x80\x99t buy the racial finger-pointing, but she can see their pain.'b'Whatever racial or class resentments she finds, Hochschild makes clear that she likes the people she meets. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t just soldiers in a class war but victims of one, too. She mourns their economic losses, praises their warmth and hospitality, and admires their \xe2\x80\x9cgrit and resilience.\xe2\x80\x9d While her hopes of finding common political ground seem overly optimistic, this is a smart, respectful and compelling book.'b'How did Adolf Hitler \xe2\x80\x94 described by one eminent magazine editor in 1930 as a \xe2\x80\x9chalf-insane rascal,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cpathetic dunderhead,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cnowhere fool,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cbig mouth\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 rise to power in the land of Goethe and Beethoven?

Some have focused on the social and political conditions in post-World War I Germany, which Hitler expertly exploited \xe2\x80\x94 bitterness over the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versailles and a yearning for a return to German greatness; unemployment and economic distress amid the worldwide Depression of the early 1930s; and longstanding ethnic prejudices and fears of \xe2\x80\x9cforeignization.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Other writers \xe2\x80\x94 including the dictator\xe2\x80\x99s latest biographer, the historian Volker Ullrich \xe2\x80\x94 have focused on Hitler as a politician who rose to power through demagoguery, showmanship and nativist appeals to the masses. In \xe2\x80\x9cHitler: Ascent, 1889-1939,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ullrich sets out to strip away the mythology that Hitler created around himself in \xe2\x80\x9cMein Kampf,\xe2\x80\x9d and he also tries to look at this \xe2\x80\x9cmysterious, calamitous figure\xe2\x80\x9d not as a monster or madman, but as a human being with \xe2\x80\x9cundeniable talents and obviously deep-seated psychological complexes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a sense,\xe2\x80\x9d he says in an introduction, \xe2\x80\x9cHitler will be \xe2\x80\x98normalized\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 although this will not make him seem more \xe2\x80\x98normal.\xe2\x80\x99 If anything, he will emerge as even more horrific.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the first of two volumes (it ends in 1939 with the dictator\xe2\x80\x99s 50th birthday) and there is little here that is substantially new. However, Mr. Ullrich offers a fascinating Shakespearean parable about how the confluence of circumstance, chance, a ruthless individual and the willful blindness of others can transform a country \xe2\x80\x94 and, in Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s case, lead to an unimaginable nightmare for the world.'b'Mr. Ullrich, like other biographers, provides vivid insight into some factors that helped turn a \xe2\x80\x9cMunich rabble-rouser\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 regarded by many as a self-obsessed \xe2\x80\x9cclown\xe2\x80\x9d with a strangely \xe2\x80\x9cscattershot, impulsive style\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 into \xe2\x80\x9cthe lord and master of the German Reich.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler was often described as an egomaniac who \xe2\x80\x9conly loved himself\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a narcissist with a taste for self-dramatization and what Mr. Ullrich calls a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic fondness for superlatives.\xe2\x80\x9d His manic speeches and penchant for taking all-or-nothing risks raised questions about his capacity for self-control, even his sanity. But Mr. Ullrich underscores Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s shrewdness as a politician \xe2\x80\x94 with a \xe2\x80\x9ckeen eye for the strengths and weaknesses of other people\xe2\x80\x9d and an ability to \xe2\x80\x9cinstantaneously analyze and exploit situations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler was known, among colleagues, for a \xe2\x80\x9cbottomless mendacity\xe2\x80\x9d that would later be magnified by a slick propaganda machine that used the latest technology (radio, gramophone records, film) to spread his message. A former finance minister wrote that Hitler \xe2\x80\x9cwas so thoroughly untruthful that he could no longer recognize the difference between lies and truth\xe2\x80\x9d and editors of one edition of \xe2\x80\x9cMein Kampf\xe2\x80\x9d described it as a \xe2\x80\x9cswamp of lies, distortions, innuendoes, half-truths and real facts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler was an effective orator and actor, Mr. Ullrich reminds readers, adept at assuming various masks and feeding off the energy of his audiences. Although he concealed his anti-Semitism beneath a \xe2\x80\x9cmask of moderation\xe2\x80\x9d when trying to win the support of the socially liberal middle classes, he specialized in big, theatrical rallies staged with spectacular elements borrowed from the circus. Here, \xe2\x80\x9cHitler adapted the content of his speeches to suit the tastes of his lower-middle-class, nationalist-conservative, ethnic-chauvinist and anti-Semitic listeners,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ullrich writes. He peppered his speeches with coarse phrases and put-downs of hecklers. Even as he fomented chaos by playing to crowds\xe2\x80\x99 fears and resentments, he offered himself as the visionary leader who could restore law and order.'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler increasingly presented himself in messianic terms, promising \xe2\x80\x9cto lead Germany to a new era of national greatness,\xe2\x80\x9d though he was typically vague about his actual plans. He often harked back to a golden age for the country, Mr. Ullrich says, the better \xe2\x80\x9cto paint the present day in hues that were all the darker. Everywhere you looked now, there was only decline and decay.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s repertoire of topics, Mr. Ullrich notes, was limited, and reading his speeches in retrospect, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems amazing that he attracted larger and larger audiences\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9crepeated mantralike phrases\xe2\x80\x9d consisting largely of \xe2\x80\x9caccusations, vows of revenge and promises for the future.\xe2\x80\x9d But Hitler virtually wrote the modern playbook on demagoguery, arguing in \xe2\x80\x9cMein Kampf\xe2\x80\x9d that propaganda must appeal to the emotions \xe2\x80\x94 not the reasoning powers \xe2\x80\x94 of the crowd. Its \xe2\x80\x9cpurely intellectual level,\xe2\x80\x9d Hitler said, \xe2\x80\x9cwill have to be that of the lowest mental common denominator among the public it is desired to reach.\xe2\x80\x9d Because the understanding of the masses \xe2\x80\x9cis feeble,\xe2\x80\x9d he went on, effective propaganda needed to be boiled down to a few slogans that should be \xe2\x80\x9cpersistently repeated until the very last individual has come to grasp the idea that has been put forward.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s rise was not inevitable, in Mr. Ullrich\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. There were numerous points at which his ascent might have been derailed, he contends; even as late as January 1933, \xe2\x80\x9cit would have been eminently possible to prevent his nomination as Reich chancellor.\xe2\x80\x9d He benefited from a \xe2\x80\x9cconstellation of crises that he was able to exploit cleverly and unscrupulously\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 in addition to economic woes and unemployment, there was an \xe2\x80\x9cerosion of the political center\xe2\x80\x9d and a growing resentment of the elites. The unwillingness of Germany\xe2\x80\x99s political parties to compromise had contributed to a perception of government dysfunction, Mr. Ullrich suggests, and the belief of Hitler supporters that the country needed \xe2\x80\x9ca man of iron\xe2\x80\x9d who could shake things up. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not give the National Socialists a chance?\xe2\x80\x9d a prominent banker said of the Nazis. \xe2\x80\x9cThey seem pretty gutsy to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s ascension was aided and abetted by the na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 of domestic adversaries who failed to appreciate his ruthlessness and tenacity, and by foreign statesmen who believed they could control his aggression. Early on, revulsion at Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s style and appearance, Mr. Ullrich writes, led some critics to underestimate the man and his popularity, while others dismissed him as a celebrity, a repellent but fascinating \xe2\x80\x9cevening\xe2\x80\x99s entertainment.\xe2\x80\x9d Politicians, for their part, suffered from the delusion that the dominance of traditional conservatives in the cabinet would neutralize the threat of Nazi abuse of power and \xe2\x80\x9cfence Hitler in.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cAs far as Hitler\xe2\x80\x99s long-term wishes were concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ullrich observes, \xe2\x80\x9chis conservative coalition partners believed either that he was not serious or that they could exert a moderating influence on him. In any case, they were severely mistaken.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler, it became obvious, could not be tamed \xe2\x80\x94 he needed only five months to consolidate absolute power after becoming chancellor. \xe2\x80\x9cNon-National Socialist German states\xe2\x80\x9d were brought into line, Mr. Ullrich writes, \xe2\x80\x9cwith pressure from the party grass roots combining effectively with pseudo-legal measures ordered by the Reich government.\xe2\x80\x9d Many Germans jumped on the Nazi bandwagon not out of political conviction but in hopes of improving their career opportunities, he argues, while fear kept others from speaking out against the persecution of the Jews. The independent press was banned or suppressed and books deemed \xe2\x80\x9cun-German\xe2\x80\x9d were burned. By March 1933, Hitler had made it clear, Mr. Ullrich says, \xe2\x80\x9cthat his government was going to do away with all norms of separation of powers and the rule of law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\xa2 Hitler had a dark, Darwinian view of the world. And he would not only become, in Mr. Ullrich\xe2\x80\x99s words, \xe2\x80\x9ca mouthpiece of the cultural pessimism\xe2\x80\x9d growing in right-wing circles in the Weimar Republic, but also the avatar of what Thomas Mann identified as a turning away from reason and the fundamental principles of a civil society \xe2\x80\x94 namely, \xe2\x80\x9cliberty, equality, education, optimism and belief in progress.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Of the myriad times since adolescence that I have returned to the story of Don Quixote de la Mancha, there is one I choose to remember \xe2\x80\x94 that I cannot help but remember \xe2\x80\x94 as we commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of Miguel de Cervantes. That reading, in October 1973, took place among a distraught group of captive men and women who, like me, had sought asylum in the Argentine Embassy in Santiago, Chile, after the coup that overthrew the democratic government of Salvador Allende.'b'In an atmosphere in which a thousand future exiles were suffocating in rooms designed to host cocktail parties, I joined a group of some 30 refugees who were reading it aloud together. Conceived as a sort of literary therapy to fight depression among us, I soon discovered that these readers had much to teach me. Many of them had come to our country from the failed revolutions of other Latin American lands, had been locked away for prolonged periods of time, and suffered torture and banishment. They instinctively understood Cervantes, who like them had been the victim of astonishing adversity and had become immensely resourceful in a cruel and disenchanted world.'b'Indeed, the defining experience of Cervantes\xe2\x80\x99s life was the harrowing five years starting in 1575 that he spent in the dungeons of Algiers as a prisoner of the Barbary pirates. It was there, on the border of Islam and the West, that Cervantes came to appreciate the value of tolerance toward those who are radically different, and it was there he discovered that of all the goods men can aspire to, freedom is by far the greatest. While awaiting a ransom that his family could not pay, confronted with execution each time he attempted to escape, watching his fellow slaves tormented and impaled, he longed for a life without manacles. But once he returned to Spain, a crippled war veteran neglected by those who had sent him into conflict, he came to the conclusion that if we cannot heal the misfortunes that assail our bodies, we can, however, hold sway over how our soul responds to those sorrows.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d was born of that revelation. In the prologue to Part\xe2\x80\xaf1 of his novel he tells the \xe2\x80\x9cidle reader\xe2\x80\x9d that it was \xe2\x80\x9cbegotten in a prison, where every discomfort has its place and every sad sound makes its home.\xe2\x80\x9d Whether that jail was in Seville or in Castro del R\xc3\xado, this recurring experience of incarceration forced him to revisit the Algerian ordeal and put him face to face with a dilemma that he resolved to our joy: Either succumb to the bitterness of despair or let loose the wings of the imagination. The result was a book that pushed the limits of creativity, subverting every tradition and convention. Instead of a rancorous indictment of a decaying Spain that had rejected and censored him, Cervantes invented a tour de force as playful and ironic as it was multifaceted, laying the ground for all the wild experiments the novelistic genre was to undergo.'b'Cervantes realized that we are all madmen constantly outpaced by history, fragile humans shackled to bodies that are doomed to eat and sleep, make love and die, made ridiculous and also glorious by the ideals we harbor. To put it bluntly, he discovered the vast psychological and social territory of the ambiguous modern condition. Captives of a harsh and unyielding reality, we are also simultaneously graced by the constant ability to surpass its battering blows.'b'Those of us reading \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d in 1973, in an embassy we could not leave, surrounded by soldiers ready to transport us to stadiums and cellars and, ultimately, cemeteries, responded viscerally to the novel. That continuous exaltation and practice of liberty, both personal and aesthetic, was inspiring. This faith was epitomized by a passage from Part\xe2\x80\xaf2 of \xe2\x80\x9cDon Quixote\xe2\x80\x9d that moved us to tears.'b'Sancho Panza has been made governor of a fictitious island by a frivolous duke. The lowly squire proves to be a far wiser and more compassionate ruler than the noblemen who mock him and his master. One night, doing the rounds, he comes upon a young lad who is running away from a constable. The boy gets cheeky, and the ersatz governor sentences him to sleep in prison. Infuriatingly, the prisoner insists that he can be put in chains but that no one has the power to make him sleep: Staying awake or not depends on his own volition and not on anyone else\xe2\x80\x99s commands. Chastened by the lad\xe2\x80\x99s independence, Sancho lets him go.'b'It is an episode that has stayed with me. If I recall it now, it is because I feel it contains the essential message Cervantes still has for today\xe2\x80\x99s desperate humanity.'b'True, most of the planet\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants are not in prison, as Cervantes so often was, nor do they find themselves confined within walls, like the revolutionaries in the Argentine Embassy. And yet we live, as if captured, in a time of violence and inequality, greed and stupidity, intolerance and xenophobia, marooned on a planet spinning out of control \xe2\x80\x94 like lunatics sleepwalking toward the abyss.'b'Cervantes died 400 years ago, and yet he continues to send us words \xe2\x80\x94 like the wisdom of that boy threatened by Sancho Panza \xe2\x80\x94 that we need to meditate upon before it is too late. Nobody has the power to make us sleep if we don\xe2\x80\x99t wish it ourselves. Cervantes is telling us that our besieged, besotted, captive humanity should not lose hope that we can awaken in time.'b''b'GUILTY THING'b''b''b'A Life of Thomas De Quincey'b''b'By Frances Wilson'b'Illustrated. 397 pp. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $30.'b''b''b''b'De Quincey recommended biography be written 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ccon amore\xe2\x80\x9d'b' and 'b'\xe2\x80\x9ccon odio.\xe2\x80\x9d'b' Love and hate. Frances Wilson delicately flavors her biography of the early-19th-century writer with both condiments but, above all, without censure. Indeed her book finishes with the rousing call to arms \xe2\x80\x9cWe are all De Quinceyan now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'De Quincey rendered himself eminently censurable with his masterpiece, \xe2\x80\x9cConfessions of an English Opium Eater.\xe2\x80\x9d In the years of his prime he was a drug fiend discriminating enough to satisfy Burroughs and Leary. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t really \xe2\x80\x9ceat\xe2\x80\x9d opium, per se, but took it in the form of laudanum, the narcotic\xe2\x80\x99s commonly ingested liquid form. He had pedophile tendencies \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cnympholepsy,\xe2\x80\x9d he called it. Dead girls, particularly, fascinated him. The fetish arose, Wilson surmises, from finding himself, at age 6, alone in a sun-drenched bedroom with the corpse of his 9-year-old sister. As the twig was bent, so the tree was (mis)shaped.'b'De Quincey inherited a fortune and went out of his way, methodically, to waste it. His later decades (despite his toxic \xe2\x80\x9ceating\xe2\x80\x9d habits, he lived to the age of 74) were a trail of bankruptcy, debt and flitting from lodgings to lodgings. He displayed total moral indifference to his half-dozen children\xe2\x80\x99s being reduced to beggary while he got on with the writing posterity now reveres him for. Who remembers good fathers?'b'When it came to being a husband and a father, De Quincey was even worse than his fellow addict, and erstwhile friend, Coleridge. But unlike Coleridge, he seems to have felt no real remorse, about this or much else. He saw the drug he celebrated in early life as a doorway into the palace of art. As he grew older and the addiction gripped him, he pictured intoxication as a Piranesi prison: a place of wonderful twisting passages, stairways and towers impossible to escape from.'b'In his most formative teenage years, vividly narrated in \xe2\x80\x9cConfessions,\xe2\x80\x9d young De Quincey bounced peripatetically between Oxford University and London\xe2\x80\x99s seething Oxford Street, the northern margin of bohemian Soho. At age 17, he sparked an intense friendship with a 15-year-old street walker, Ann. When she disappeared, her ghost haunted him. He would, all his life, look into the faces of women he did not know in search of his lost nymph.'b'At Oxford, De Quincey disdained the final oral exams because they were not, as advertised, conducted in ancient Greek. The \xe2\x80\x9choary\xe2\x80\x9d university, he determined, was beneath him. \xe2\x80\x9cI owe thee nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d he dismissively informed it. This was one of many willful turns in De\xe2\x80\xafQuincey\xe2\x80\x99s life. He had been born the son of a linen merchant enriched in the early Industrial Revolution. Thomas senior died early, leaving the care of the family to a terrifyingly evangelical mother with whom Thomas junior was, for all his life, on bad terms. It was his mother who added the absurd \xe2\x80\x9cDe\xe2\x80\x9d to the family surname. He despised her for doing it but kept it. England was engaged in a never-ending war with France. It pleased him to vex the \xe2\x80\x9cswinish multitude\xe2\x80\x9d (a favorite quotation of De Quincey\xe2\x80\x99s, from Burke) with that Gallic prefix.'b'De Quincey first took opium to relieve a toothache. It provoked a change of life and those infamous rhapsodies in \xe2\x80\x9cConfessions,\xe2\x80\x9d e.g.: \xe2\x80\x9cI took it \xe2\x80\x94 and in an hour, oh! Heavens! What a revulsion! What an upheaving, from its lowest depths, of the inner spirit! What an apocalypse of the world within me!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His first literary worship was of the \xe2\x80\x9cmarvelous boy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the phrase is from Wordsworth\xe2\x80\x99s poem \xe2\x80\x9cResolution and Independence\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Thomas Chatterton, the forger of antique poetry, who \xe2\x80\x9cate\xe2\x80\x9d a lethal dose of arsenic and opium at 17, rather than face adulthood and obloquy.'b'It was in his later teens that De Quincey discovered his God: Wordsworth. Human nature, he believed, had changed with the publication of \xe2\x80\x9cLyrical Ballads\xe2\x80\x9d in 1798. He wrote Wordsworth an unsolicited letter \xe2\x80\x94 his \xe2\x80\x9cfirst masterpiece,\xe2\x80\x9d Wilson calls it. It would take another four years, however, in response to a frigidly cordial reply from the great man, for him to bring himself to travel to the Lake District and have his Damascene moment.'b'Though the experience was epochal for De Quincey, he was, initially, serviceable to Wordsworth. Particularly in the matter of punctuation. Wordsworth, incidentally, comes across as an utter prig as Frances Wilson portrays him.'b'De Quincey appointed himself a courtier to the Lakeland coterie of Wordsworth, Coleridge and Southey. He entertained them royally. His money, while it lasted, proved useful \xe2\x80\x94 particularly to Coleridge, always ready to cadge a pound or two. His conversation was remarkable although it was noted (in later life) it could be rather slurred by the afternoon.'b'Having disgraced himself by marrying a house servant, De Quincey was not, the Wordsworths told him, to expect to take tea with them thereafter. Having borne eight living children, his wife, Margaret, died early, exhausted with the burdens of being Mrs. De Quincey. Worse still, Wordsworth cast him off.'b'After 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 intimacy with the Wordsworth circle, De Quincey left, as Wilson puts it, the University of the Lakes for the Athens of the North, trailing a woebegone brood of motherless children behind him. In Edinburgh he installed himself in a vibrant literary world, dominated by Walter Scott, James Hogg and Blackwood\xe2\x80\x99s Magazine. He hacked out a stream of brilliant articles, the pittance they yielded never quite keeping the wolf from the door or providing adequately for his offspring. His intake of opium in these years was heroic: up to 10,000 drops of laudanum a day.'b'There have been many excellent biographies of De Quincey. Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s is original by virtue of being primarily an investigation into the extraordinary \xe2\x80\x9cpalimpsest\xe2\x80\x9d of his mind. But De Quincey\xe2\x80\x99s best biographer, Wilson reminds us, will always be De Quincey himself. He pioneered self-reflection (\xe2\x80\x9cautobiography,\xe2\x80\x9d as it was beginning to be called) as a literary form, from \xe2\x80\x9cConfessions\xe2\x80\x9d to his bleak summa, \xe2\x80\x9cSuspiria de Profundis.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'De Quincey was derided by his enemies and even by his friends as a literary parasite. Thomas Carlyle leaves a judicious verbal cartoon. Physically the diminutive De Quincey was, Carlyle quips, as unprepossessing as a pair of sugar tongs. But he was, when he sat by candlelight in the evening, like \xe2\x80\x9cthe beautifullest little child; blue-eyed, sparkling face, had there not been something, too, which said, \xe2\x80\x98Eccovi \xe2\x80\x94 this child has been in hell.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Wordsworth, his cruelly uncaring God, regarded his former acolyte, in the last decades of their lives, as a sot and a terrible nuisance. Meanwhile De Quincey was writing \xe2\x80\x94 in lonely Edinburgh exile \xe2\x80\x94 his \xe2\x80\x9cLake Reminiscences,\xe2\x80\x9d without which, as Wilson says, Wordsworth would have been, for literary history, nothing more than a \xe2\x80\x9cdistant figure in a black coat.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'De Quincey went beyond Wordsworth, and even Coleridge, into dangerous places. He was fascinated by the demons released on the dark fringe of the Romantic Movement. He even applauded murder in his most brilliant articles as one of the finer \xe2\x80\x9carts\xe2\x80\x9d of life. Cain\xe2\x80\x99s act was, like opium, a royal road to the human unconscious. Literature\xe2\x80\x99s groaning shelves of \xe2\x80\x9ccrime fiction,\xe2\x80\x9d from Edgar Allan Poe to Hannibal Lecter, owe a primal debt to Thomas De Quincey.'b'One great question hovers over this exemplary book: Would De Quincey have been the greater had he abstained from toxins and conscientiously cultivated his talents? Frances Wilson\xe2\x80\x99s answer seems a defiant no. The great experiment Thomas De Quincey undertook with his life and art is one of the dark glories of English literature.'b''b'The year\xe2\x80\x99s notable fiction, poetry and nonfiction, selected by the editors of The New York Times Book Review.

(Grand Central, $26.)'b' Humorous riffs on being a woman by Amy Schumer\xe2\x80\x99s head writer.'b'Two days after the presidential election, Eliot A. Cohen \xe2\x80\x94 military historian, former counselor to Condoleezza Rice at the State Department and 'b'impassioned Never Trumper'b' \xe2\x80\x94 wrote an 'b'essay in The American Interest'b' intended to console his anxious friends. Yes, he conceded, the notion of a Donald J. Trump presidency was far from ideal (\xe2\x80\x9cdreadful\xe2\x80\x9d was the precise word he used), but he\xe2\x80\x99d still advise fellow Republicans to work for the new president, so long as each kept an unsigned letter of resignation just a file drawer away.'b'Shortly thereafter, one of Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s friends in Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s circle reached out to him, asking for names. Mr. Cohen provided them. Then things took a nasty turn.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter exchange w Trump transition team, changed my recommendation: stay away,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he tweeted'b' on the morning of Nov. 15. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re angry, arrogant, screaming \xe2\x80\x98you LOST!\xe2\x80\x99 Will be ugly.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'His message was retweeted nearly 14,000 times.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s what you get for provoking someone who\xe2\x80\x99s made a careful study of the uses of hard power. Mr. Cohen knows all too well the impact of a carefully timed smart bomb.'b'Had Hillary Clinton won, it\xe2\x80\x99s doubtful that Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s new book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Stick: The Limits of Soft Power &amp; the Necessity of Military Force,\xe2\x80\x9d which he clearly finished well before the election, would receive the attention it now surely (and quite deservedly) will. For all of Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s chest-pounding about the Islamic State, it was Mrs. Clinton, ultimately, who was viewed as the more interventionist, even hawkish, of the two candidates.'b'But it was her rival, the erratic isolationist with a mysterious affection for Vladimir V. Putin and a worrying contempt for NATO, who won, which makes Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s book both an implicit critique of the president-elect\xe2\x80\x99s worldview (to the extent that he has one) and a toothsome snack for those who despise Mr. Trump. Even if you disagree with Mr. Cohen \xe2\x80\x94 and I did, often, scribbling violent objections in the margins as I read \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to spend time in his company. He writes thoughtfully, methodically and with unfussy erudition. His chapters are organized with the pleasing precision of a bento box.'b'The main argument of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Stick\xe2\x80\x9d is encapsulated in its subtitle and its sly cover image, a close-up of a pair of boots on the ground. He makes an unfashionable, unabashed and \xe2\x80\x94 above all \xe2\x80\x94 unwavering case for the use of force in the service of American security and ideals. To shy away from hard power, in Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s view, would come at great moral and mortal cost in a world of irrational regimes, religious revolutionaries, cyber guerrillas and bellicose competitors like China and Russia.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe chances are growing that the United States will find itself using military power chronically, and at varying levels of intensity, throughout the early decades of the 21st century,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes in his introduction.'b'It is perhaps an occupational hazard in Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s line of work to see the world in light of its dangers. (He also has 'b'a son who\xe2\x80\x99s done two tours of duty in Iraq, and a daughter in the Navy'b' \xe2\x80\x94 two facts he admirably never mentions, let alone exploits, in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big Stick.\xe2\x80\x9d) Those with dovish inclinations will doubtless propose very different solutions to the problems he identifies. But he does a very good job of identifying them, providing a thorough if disconcerting tour d\xe2\x80\x99horizon.'b'On Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s list of concerns, China ranks highest: Its naval aggression and transgressions could reshape the international order, particularly if it starts a conflict with one of our allies. Russia\xe2\x80\x99s aggression concerns him, too, especially now that it has found sympathetic authoritarian and nativist governments in the West. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout unity,\xe2\x80\x9d he notes, \xe2\x80\x9cNATO is paralyzed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the time Mr. Cohen wrote that sentence, he was referring to the governments of Hungary and Greece, which have both shown themselves to be sympathetic to Mr. Putin. Who would have imagined adding the next American president to the list?'b'Also relevant to the new world order: Mr. Cohen believes that the only way to fight global terror in any meaningful way is through long, sustained campaigns on the ground, as well as from the air. (Imagine how much more stable Libya would be, he asks, if the United States and its allies had sent in troops just after the overthrow of Muammar el-Qaddafi.)'b'But in order for this strategy to work, both the American public and its leaders would have to make a dramatic psychological adjustment, thinking much more flexibly, and patiently, about war. They would have to accept that future conflicts may be neither swift nor immediately decisive. \xe2\x80\x9cSuch an honest appraisal,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Cohen writes, \xe2\x80\x9cwill test the character of politicians who, naturally enough, hope to end their tenures having won, or at least finished, the wars that they have begun or inherited.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is a tall order for any elected official. For Mr. Trump, who made \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to win so big\xe2\x80\x9d a rallying cry, it seems higher than the moon.'b'All of Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s proposals would cost a great deal of money \xe2\x80\x94 and, potentially, human lives. He\xe2\x80\x99d like to see forces deployed in Poland and the Baltic States to ward off Russian hostilities. He\xe2\x80\x99d like to see a beefed-up air and naval presence in the Persian Gulf to thwart Iran. In retrospect, he wishes we\xe2\x80\x99d left 10,000 to 20,000 troops in Iraq. (He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t address the sticky problem of reconciling this idea with the Iraqi desire for sovereignty.)'b'These may not be the most practical or, to many, desirable suggestions. Mr. Cohen is well aware of the contemporary arguments arrayed against America\xe2\x80\x99s interest, or competence, in waging war, which he addresses in Chapter 1. But they\xe2\x80\x99re one response to an increasingly dangerous \xe2\x80\x94 and nuclearized \xe2\x80\x94 globe. To read Mr. Cohen is to realize that he thinks for a living about terrible things: Pakistan\xe2\x80\x99s lobbing a nuke at India; Israel\xe2\x80\x99s lobbing a nuke at Iran; the United States\xe2\x80\x99 launching a nuclear weapon at North Korea; China\xe2\x80\x99s threatening to launch one at us.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo assume that nuclear weapons, or some overwhelming logic of international politics, make statesmen cautious,\xe2\x80\x9d he writes, \xe2\x80\x9cis to assume that human beings are not capable of tremendous error, which is almost to assume that they are not human.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just before Christmas, Mr. Trump tweeted that the United States \xe2\x80\x9cmust greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability.\xe2\x80\x9d What that meant we do not know. It could have meant that he will violate existing nuclear treaties. It could have meant nothing specific \xe2\x80\x94 just another inchoate emanation from his head.'b'Mr. Cohen notes that all presidential candidates\xe2\x80\x99 views of national security change once they\xe2\x80\x99re in office, because they\xe2\x80\x99re forced to confront the world as it is, not the world as they wish it to be. The problem is that Mr. Trump apparently does not sit still for the intelligence briefings that try to describe the world as it is. And if that\xe2\x80\x99s the case, the future may not be as dark as Mr. Cohen foresees. It may be darker.'b''b'MY LIFE, MY LOVE, MY LEGACY'b''b'By Coretta Scott King, as told to Barbara Reynolds'b'Illustrated. 356 pp. Henry Holt &amp; Company. $30.'b''b''b'Nearly every image of Coretta Scott King since her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death has seemed suffused with preternatural stillness, her face fixed with the brave solitude of timeless interior bereavement. For all of her accomplishment and vivacity in real life, she has remained frozen in the collective imagination, among that sad pantheon of civil-rights-era icons: the political widow in a pillbox hat. King describes the weight of that identity in \xe2\x80\x9cMy Life, My Love, My Legacy,\xe2\x80\x9d her posthumous memoir, as told to the journalist Barbara Reynolds over a period of 30 years. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a Mrs. King. There is also Coretta. How one became detached from the other remains a mystery to me,\xe2\x80\x9d King says.'b'This book is distinctly Coretta\xe2\x80\x99s story. While there is nothing to radically challenge the impression of her as carefully restrained, what makes \xe2\x80\x9cMy Life\xe2\x80\x9d particularly absorbing is its quiet account of a brutal historical era, as experienced by a very particular kind of African-American woman: well educated, cautious, a prototypically 1950s-style wife and mother. The book\xe2\x80\x99s cover features a picture of King, young and smiling, but still radiating that unmistakable aura of church-lady reserve.'b'Though such women have rarely been given voice, they were the staunch backbone of the civil rights movement. They raised funds as well as children, did the accounting as well as the housework, taught school and cooked the meals. They kept the minutes at N.A.A.C.P. meetings, played the organ at church, coordinated their husbands\xe2\x80\x99 schedules.'b'Like Coretta Scott King, they operated within a regime that was both punishing and exhausting for being so utterly beholden to the politics of respectability. The pressure to disprove pervasive cultural stereotypes of slovenliness, ignorance, criminal threat and rapacious sexuality meant striving for perfection always. One could not risk being charged with the slightest human fallibility for fear of deadly retribution. The harshly unforgiving surveillance of the larger white community was reiterated within black communities as the stress of constant, and sometimes cruel, self-surveillance.'b'Living with terror is the thread that runs through \xe2\x80\x9cMy Life.\xe2\x80\x9d This is a tale of church assaults before Dylann Roof, of cattle prods before there were tasers, of nooses before there were chokeholds, of Cointelpro before there was Breitbart, of voter suppression before anyone bothered to deny it. King\xe2\x80\x99s earliest memories include her parents\xe2\x80\x99 home being burned down when she was 15 years old. As she grows up, neighbors disappear. Bodies are found hanging from trees. Among the in-laws, her husband\xe2\x80\x99s mother was shot and killed in the middle of a church service by a mentally disturbed man; his brother was found floating in a pool under suspicious circumstances; and when his father, Martin Luther King Sr., passes away at the age of 84, it marked \xe2\x80\x9cthe first time any senior member of the King family had died a natural death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Some say that religion is, at base, a mechanism to handle the human response to mortality and loss. And for all the death and tragedy in \xe2\x80\x9cMy Life,\xe2\x80\x9d it is King\xe2\x80\x99s grounding in her husband\xe2\x80\x99s theology of peaceful resistance that enables her survival against excruciating odds. Nonviolence, she reiterates, is not a matter of passively accepting whatever happens. It is active. It is a practice. As her husband preached: \xe2\x80\x9cJustice is really love in calculation.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That power, of love as calculation, composes King, binds her together, time and again. Her practice of such belief is meditative, and becomes reflected in her diction: She speaks of endurance, overcoming, soul-sustenance for the long term. There is little in the way of open sadness in this book; after her husband\xe2\x80\x99s assassination, she turns to the project of creating the King Center as a monument to him, filling the emptiness with boxes of his notes and speeches.'b'By the same token, there is a marked absence of expressed joy, other than at the birth of her children. Her emotions are muted in a way that is intriguing rather than off-putting. This disposition also presents the reader with a different way of looking at the world \xe2\x80\x94 one of extraordinary calm and the purest resolve. It is restful somehow, and generous, in a manner that is unfashionable in our culture of 24/7 emotional display. King\xe2\x80\x99s language does not privilege personal happiness, private delights, exuberant emotional extremes of any sort. Rather, her life is filtered through prescribed priorities, devotions, principles, commitments. This is life lived in service to others rather than with concern for individual regard or even personal safety.'b'There is unusual inspiration in that mien. Before becoming King\xe2\x80\x99s amanuensis, Barbara Reynolds was a journalist assigned to do a story for The Chicago Tribune. They became such good friends that Reynolds changed her vocation along the way: \xe2\x80\x9cBefore I started hanging around with Mrs. King, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much of a Christian.\xe2\x80\x9d But hang around she did, and by the time King died in 2006, Reynolds had become an ordained minister. It is but one small tribute to the power of the King family\xe2\x80\x99s dedication to a \xe2\x80\x9cMinistry of Presence.\xe2\x80\x9d The larger, more ecumenical meaning of Coretta Scott King\xe2\x80\x99s life, love and legacy may be found in the peace-lending power, needed now as never before, of prophetic traditions that hold us and heal, \xe2\x80\x9cbringing into existence images and a destiny we had not seen or lived before.\xe2\x80\x9d'
