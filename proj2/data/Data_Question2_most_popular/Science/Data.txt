b'Not just one, but seven 'b'Earth'b'-size planets that could potentially harbor life have been identified orbiting a tiny star not too far away, offering the first realistic opportunity to search for signs of alien life outside the solar system.'b'The planets orbit a dwarf star named Trappist-1, about 40 light-years, or 235 trillion miles, from Earth. That is quite close in cosmic terms, and by happy accident, the orientation of the orbits of the seven planets allows them to be studied in great detail.'b'One or more of the exoplanets in this new system could be at the right temperature to be awash in oceans of water, astronomers said, based on the distance of the planets from the dwarf star.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first time so many planets of this kind are found around the same star,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Gillon, an astronomer at the University of Liege in Belgium and the leader of an international team that has been observing Trappist-1, said during a telephone news conference organized by the journal Nature, which published 'b'the findings on Wednesday'b'.'b'Scientists could even discover compelling evidence of aliens.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that we have made a crucial step toward finding if there is life out there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amaury H. M. J. Triaud, an astronomer at the University of Cambridge in England and another member of the research team. \xe2\x80\x9cHere, if life managed to thrive and releases gases similar to that we have on Earth, then we will know.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cool red dwarfs are the most common type of star, so astronomers are likely to find more planetary systems like that around Trappist-1 in the coming years.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can just imagine how many worlds are out there that have a shot to becoming a habitable ecosystem,\xe2\x80\x9d Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s science mission directorate, said during a NASA news conference on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x9cAre we alone out there? We\xe2\x80\x99re making a step forward with this \xe2\x80\x94 a leap forward, in fact \xe2\x80\x94 towards answering that question.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Telescopes on the ground now and the 'b'Hubble Space Telescope'b' in orbit will be able to discern some of the molecules in the planetary atmospheres. The 'b'James Webb Space Telescope'b', scheduled to launch next year, will peer at the infrared wavelengths of light, ideal for studying Trappist-1.'b'Comparisons among the different conditions of the seven will also be revealing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Trappist-1 planets make the search for life in the galaxy imminent,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Sara Seager'b', an astronomer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not a member of the research team. \xe2\x80\x9cFor the first time ever, we don\xe2\x80\x99t have to speculate. We just have to wait and then make very careful observations and see what is in the atmospheres of the Trappist planets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even if the planets all turn out to be lifeless, scientists will have learned more about what keeps life from flourishing.'b'Astronomers always knew other stars must have planets, but until a couple of decades ago, they had not been able to spot them. Now they have confirmed more than 3,400, according to the 'b'Open Exoplanet Catalog'b'. (An exoplanet is a planet around a star other than the sun.)'b'The authors of the Nature paper include Didier Queloz, one of the astronomers who discovered in 1995 the first known exoplanet around a sunlike star.'b'While the Trappist planets are about the size of Earth \xe2\x80\x94 give or take 25 percent in diameter \xe2\x80\x94 the star is very different from our sun.'b'Trappist-1, named after a robotic telescope in the Atacama Desert of Chile that the astronomers initially used to study the star, is what astronomers call an \xe2\x80\x9cultracool dwarf,\xe2\x80\x9d with only one-twelfth the mass of the sun and a surface temperature of 4,150 degrees Fahrenheit, much cooler than the 10,000 degrees radiating from the sun. Trappist is a shortening of Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope.'b'During the NASA news conference, Dr. Gillon gave a simple analogy: If our sun were the size of a basketball, Trappist-1 would be a golf ball.'b'Until the last few years, scientists looking for life elsewhere in the galaxy have focused on finding Earth-size planets around sun-like stars. But it is hard to pick out the light of a planet from the glare of a bright star. Small dim dwarfs are much easier to study.'b'Last year, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-size planet around 'b'Proxima Centauri'b', the closest star at 4.24 light-years away. That discovery was made using a different technique that does not allow for study of the atmosphere.'b'Trappist-1 periodically dimmed noticeably, indicating that a planet might be passing in front of the star, blocking part of the light. From the shape of the dips, the astronomers calculate the size of the planet.'b'Trappist-1\xe2\x80\x99s light dipped so many times that the astronomers concluded, in 'b'research reported last year'b', that there were at least three planets around the star. Telescopes from around the world then also observed Trappist-1, as did the 'b'Spitzer Space Telescope'b' of NASA.'b'Spitzer observed Trappist-1 nearly around the clock for 20 days, capturing 34 transits. Together with the ground observations, it let the scientists calculate not three planets, but seven. The planets are too small and too close to the star to be photographed directly.'b'All seven are very close to the dwarf star, circling more quickly than the planets in our solar system. The innermost completes an orbit in just 1.5 days. The farthest one completes an orbit in about 20 days. That makes the planetary system more like the moons of Jupiter than a larger planetary system like our solar system.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey form a very compact system,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Gillon said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe planets being pulled close to each other and very close to the star.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In addition, the orbital periods of the inner six suggest that the planets formed farther away from the star and then were all gradually pulled inward, Dr. Gillon said.'b'Because the planets are so close to a cool star, their surfaces could be at the right temperatures to have water flow, considered one of the essential ingredients for life.'b'The fourth, fifth and sixth planets orbit in the star\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chabitable zone,\xe2\x80\x9d where the planets could sport oceans. So far that is just speculation, but by measuring which wavelengths of light are blocked by the planet, scientists will be able to figure out what gases float in the atmospheres of the seven planets.'b'So far, they have confirmed for the two innermost planets that they are not enveloped in hydrogen. That means they are rocky like Earth, ruling out the possibility that they were mini-Neptune gas planets that are prevalent around many other stars.'b'Because the planets are so close to Trappist-1, they have quite likely become \xe2\x80\x9cgravitationally locked\xe2\x80\x9d to the star, always with one side of the planets facing the star, much as it is always the same side of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s moon facing Earth. That would mean one side would be warmer, but an atmosphere would distribute heat, and the scientists said that would not be an insurmountable obstacle for life.'b'For a person standing on one of the planets, it would be a dim environment, with perhaps only about one two-hundredth the light that we see from the sun on Earth, Dr. Triaud said. (That would still be brighter than the moon at night.) The star would be far bigger. On Trappist-1f, the fifth planet, the star would be three times as wide as the sun seen from Earth.'b'As for the color of the star, \xe2\x80\x9cwe had a debate about that,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Triaud said.'b'Some of the scientists expected a deep red, but with most of the star\xe2\x80\x99s light emitted at infrared wavelengths and out of view of human eyes, perhaps a person would \xe2\x80\x9csee something more salmon-y,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Triaud said.'b'NASA released a poster illustrating 'b'what the sky of the fourth planet might look like'b'.'b'If observations reveal oxygen in a planet\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere, that could point to photosynthesis of plants \xe2\x80\x94 although not conclusively. But oxygen together with methane, ozone and carbon dioxide, particularly in certain proportions, \xe2\x80\x9cwould tell us that there is life with 99 percent confidence,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Gillon said.'b'Astronomers expect that a few decades of technological advances are needed before similar observations can be made of Earthlike planets around larger, brighter sunlike stars.'b'Dr. Triaud said that if there is life around Trappist-1, \xe2\x80\x9cthen it\xe2\x80\x99s good we didn\xe2\x80\x99t wait too long.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf there isn\xe2\x80\x99t, then we have learned something quite deep about where life can emerge,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued.'b'The discovery might also mean that scientists who have been searching for radio signals from alien civilizations might also have been searching in the wrong places if most habitable planets orbit dwarfs, which live far longer than larger stars like the sun.'b'The SETI Institute in Mountain View, Calif., is using the 'b'Allen Telescope Array'b', a group of 42 radio dishes in California, to scrutinize 20,000 red dwarfs. \xe2\x80\x9cThis result is kind of a justification for that project,\xe2\x80\x9d said Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the institute.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for complex biology \xe2\x80\x94 intelligent aliens that might take a long time to evolve from pond scum \xe2\x80\x94 older could be better,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Shostak said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems a good bet that the majority of clever beings populating the universe look up to see a dim, reddish sun hanging in their sky. And at least they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to worry about sun block.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this at home, pause and put on a song you can\xe2\x80\x99t resist dancing to. Go on, bop your head to the beat. Let yourself wiggle a bit. Throw in some arms and legs. If you\xe2\x80\x99re reading this at work, maybe imagine these things at your desk.'b'As you\xe2\x80\x99re dancing, pay attention to where and how you\xe2\x80\x99re moving. How much are you swaying your hips? Are your legs moving together or independently of each other? How vigorously are you moving your torso?'b'You should note those movements, because very specific patterns may make some people appear to be better dancers than others. That\xe2\x80\x99s the conclusion of a study 'b'published'b' on Thursday in Scientific Reports, in which researchers asked 200 people to rate 39 female dancers. A few features stood out as contributing to higher-quality dance: big hip swings, and the right and left limbs moving independently of one another (which the researchers describe as asymmetric arm and thigh movements).'b'The researchers speculate that those moves serve two purposes for heterosexual women. \xe2\x80\x9cOne is, they\xe2\x80\x99re showing off their reproductive quality, perhaps their hormonal status, to males,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Nick Neave'b', an associate professor of psychology at Northumbria University in England and an author of the paper. \xe2\x80\x9cAnother is, they\xe2\x80\x99re showing off how good they are to female rivals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 2011, the same researchers 'b'reported'b' that women preferred certain dance moves by men, especially exaggerated movements in the upper body. In other studies, Dr. Neave and his colleagues have found links between male dance attractiveness and 'b'risk-taking'b', as well as 'b'handgrip strength'b', a marker for overall body strength.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe know that dance moves are signaling strength and vigor in males,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Neave said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to do the same research with females.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the study, his team asked 39 female university students in Britain to dance alone to a drum beat. The researchers used a motion-capture system to track the women\xe2\x80\x99s moves. They animated each dancer as an avatar to try to make sure that only the dance movements \xe2\x80\x94 and no other physical features \xe2\x80\x94 would affect ratings. Then they recruited 57 men and 143 women to watch 15-second clips of the avatars and rate them each on a numeric scale.'b'Hip movements were the key predictor of how positively a dancer was rated in this study, perhaps because they\xe2\x80\x99re an indicator of femininity. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen you look at males and females walking, the key difference is, males have this shoulder swing and females have this hip swing,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Neave said. Asymmetric limb movements, meanwhile, may signal good motor control.'b'Dancing may have first developed as a form of courtship display in humans.'b'But it may not be about just sexual attraction and competition, though research tends to focus on that lens, said 'b'Helena Paterson'b', a psychology lecturer at the University of Glasgow who was not involved in this study. \xe2\x80\x9cIt could also be about affiliation, friendship or bonds to other people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen someone shows confidence through dancing, they might attract you as a friend or someone you want to spend time with.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The study is part of a larger field called 'b'social cognition'b', which aims to understand how people use small bits of perceptual information to make large inferences about their social world, said 'b'Frank Pollick'b', a psychology professor at the University of Glasgow whose laboratory is running its own, crowdsourced 'b'experiment'b' on dance attraction.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou see somebody dancing, or hear their voice, and you make a lot of detailed judgments about their personal properties,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThose inferences often go far past the information that\xe2\x80\x99s truly there, yet they seem to exist for some reason.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Neave and his team say they now want to see if dance attractiveness correlates with personality, health, age or hormonal status in women. Other questions are how culture and sexual orientation affect dancing and perceptions of dancing.'b'As for practical advice from his research, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no harm in trying to throw different moves at the disco,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. But beware of drinking too much before hitting the dance floor, he added. That \xe2\x80\x9ccould help with causing asymmetry in arms and legs \xe2\x80\x94 but obviously that could also be disastrous.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Over the years, scientists have come up with a lot of ideas about why we sleep.'b'Some have argued that it\xe2\x80\x99s a way to save energy. Others have suggested that slumber provides an opportunity to clear away the brain\xe2\x80\x99s cellular waste. Still others have proposed that sleep simply forces animals to lie still, letting them hide from predators.'b'A pair of papers published on Thursday in the journal Science offer evidence for another notion: We sleep to forget some of the things we learn each day.'b'In order to learn, we have to grow connections, or synapses, between the neurons in our brains. These connections enable neurons to send signals to one another quickly and efficiently. We store new memories in these networks.'b'In 2003, Giulio Tononi and Chiara Cirelli, biologists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, 'b'proposed that synapses 'b'grew so exuberantly during the day that our brain circuits got \xe2\x80\x9cnoisy.\xe2\x80\x9d When we sleep, the scientists argued, our brains pare back the connections to lift the signal over the noise.'b'In the years since, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli, along with other researchers, have found a great deal of indirect evidence to support the so-called synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.'b'It turns out, for example, that neurons can prune their synapses \xe2\x80\x94 at least in a dish. In laboratory experiments on clumps of neurons, scientists can give them a drug that spurs them to grow extra synapses. Afterward, the neurons pare back some of the growth.'b'Other evidence comes from the electric waves released by the brain. During deep sleep, the waves slow down. Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli have argued that shrinking synapses produce this change.'b'Four years ago, Dr. Tononi and Dr. Cirelli got a chance to test their theory by looking at the synapses themselves. They acquired a kind of deli slicer for brain tissue, which they used to shave ultrathin sheets from a mouse\xe2\x80\x99s brain.'b'Luisa de Vivo, an assistant scientist working in their lab, led a painstaking survey of tissue taken from mice, some awake and others asleep. She and her colleagues determined the size and shape of 6,920 synapses in total.'b'The synapses in the brains of sleeping mice, they found, were 18 percent smaller than in awake ones. \xe2\x80\x9cThat there\xe2\x80\x99s such a big change over all is surprising,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Tononi said.'b''b'The second study 'b' was led by Graham H. Diering, a postdoctoral researcher at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Diering and his colleagues set out to explore the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis by studying the proteins in mouse brains. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m really coming at it from this nuts-and-bolts place,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Diering said.'b'In one experiment, Dr. Diering and his colleagues created a tiny window through which they could peer into mouse brains. Then he and his colleagues added a chemical that lit up a surface protein on brain synapses.'b'Looking through the window, they found that the number of surface proteins dropped during sleep. That decline is what you would expect if the synapses were shrinking.'b'Dr. Diering and his colleagues then searched for the molecular trigger for this change. They found that hundreds of proteins increase or decrease inside of synapses during the night. But one protein in particular, called Homer1A, stood out.'b'In earlier experiments on neurons in a dish, Homer1A proved to be important for paring back synapses. Dr. Diering wondered if it was important in sleep, too.'b'To find out, he and his colleagues studied mice genetically engineered so that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t make Homer1A proteins. These mice slept like ordinary mice, but their synapses didn\xe2\x80\x99t change their proteins like the ones in ordinary mice.'b'Dr. Diering\xe2\x80\x99s research suggests that sleepiness triggers neurons to make Homer1A and ship it into their synapses. When sleep arrives, Homer1A turns on the pruning machinery.'b'To see how this pruning machinery affects learning, the scientists gave regular mice a memory test. They put the animals in a room where they got a mild electric shock if they walked over one section of the floor.'b'That night, the scientists injected a chemical into the brains of some of the mice. The chemical had been shown to block neurons in dishes from pruning their synapses.'b'The next day, the scientists put all the mice back in the chamber they had been in before. Both groups of mice spent much of the time frozen, fearfully recalling the shock.'b'But when the researchers put the mice in a different chamber, they saw a big difference. The ordinary mice sniffed around curiously. The mice that had been prevented from pruning their brain synapses during sleep, on the other hand, froze once again.'b'Dr. Diering thinks that the injected mice couldn\xe2\x80\x99t narrow their memories down to the particular chamber where they had gotten the shock. Without nighttime pruning, their memories ended up fuzzy.'b'In their own experiment, Dr. Tononi and his colleagues found that the pruning didn\xe2\x80\x99t strike every neuron. A fifth of the synapses were unchanged. It\xe2\x80\x99s possible that these synapses encode well-established memories that shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be tampered with.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can forget in a smart way,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Tononi said.'b'Other researchers cautioned that the new findings weren\xe2\x80\x99t definitive proof of the synaptic homeostasis hypothesis.'b'Marcos G. Frank, a sleep researcher at Washington State University in Spokane, said that it could be hard to tell whether changes to the brain at night were caused by sleep or by the biological clock. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a general problem in the field,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Markus H. Schmidt, of the Ohio Sleep Medicine Institute, said that while the brain might prune synapses during sleep, he questioned whether this was the main explanation for why sleep exists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe work is great,\xe2\x80\x9d he said of the new studies, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the question is, is this a function of sleep or is it 'b'the'b' function?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many organs, not just the brain, seem to function differently during sleep, Dr. Schmidt pointed out. The gut appears to make many new cells, for example.'b'Dr. Tononi said that the new findings should prompt a look at what current sleeping drugs do in the brain. While they may be good at making people sleepy, it\xe2\x80\x99s also possible that they may interfere with the pruning required for forming memories.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou may actually work against yourself,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Tononi said.'b'In the future, sleep medicines might precisely target the molecules involved in sleep, ensuring that synapses get properly pruned.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnce you know a little bit of what happens at the ground-truth level, you can get a better idea of what to do for therapy,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Tononi said.'b'Every continent save Antarctica is ringed by vast stretches of seagrass, underwater prairies that together cover an area roughly equal to California.'b'Seagrass meadows, among the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, play an outsize role in the health of the oceans. They shelter important fish species, filter pollutants from seawater, and lock up huge amounts of atmosphere-warming carbon.'b'The plants also fight disease, it turns out. A team of scientists reported on Thursday that seagrasses can purge pathogens from the ocean that threaten humans and coral reefs alike. (The first hint came when the scientists were struck with dysentery after diving to coral reefs without neighboring seagrass.)'b'But the meadows are vanishing at a rate of a football field every 30 minutes. Joleah B. Lamb, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University and the lead author of the new study, said she hoped it would help draw attention to their plight.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe call seagrass the ugly stepchild of marine organisms,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Lamb. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t get a lot of respect, compared to corals and mangroves.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Seagrass first evolved tens of millions years ago, when some flowering plants moved from land into the ocean. They still grow flowers, pollen and seeds, but they now do so underwater, with a powerful form of photosynthesis that allows them to thrive in dim light at depths of up to 190 feet.'b'The sediment in which they grow is loaded with deadly hydrogen sulfide. They detoxify by pumping some of the oxygen they release during photosynthesis into their roots.'b'With these adaptations, seagrass meadows became more productive than today\xe2\x80\x99s fertilized cornfields. As they spread across the planet, the meadows altered the sea floor, building soil and supporting entirely new ecosystems. Animals like manatees and juvenile fish took up residence.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cKiller whales are a big tourist attraction, but people probably don\xe2\x80\x99t realize that seagrass beds are really important as nurseries for the fish that the salmon require, which the killer whales require,\xe2\x80\x9d said C. Drew Harvell, a marine biologist at Cornell University and senior author of the new study.'b'Humans depend on these nurseries, too. Many of the species harvested in commercial fisheries begin life in seagrass meadows. Without them, fishermen would catch far less, and make less money.'b'In 2014, University of Cambridge researchers studied seagrass meadows in southern Australia to estimate the value they bring to the fisheries industry. They estimate that each acre of seagrass 'b'adds about $87,000 per year'b'.'b'The plants also draw fertilizer runoff and other pollutants out of the water, locking them safely away in meadow soil. Scientists have estimated that an acre of seagrass provides more than $11,000 worth of filtering every year.'b'These services alone would make seagrass meadows among the most economically valuable ecosystems on Earth. But now Dr. Harvell, Dr. Lamb and their colleagues have found that these plants may help us in another way: by wiping out pathogens.'b'Their new study, published in the journal Science, began with a scuba diving trip in Indonesia. The scientists were inspecting coral reefs for infections with bacteria and fungi; some reefs are increasingly falling prey to these diseases.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy the end of the four-day workshop, we all came down with amoebic dysentery,\xe2\x80\x9d recalled Dr. Harvell. \xe2\x80\x9cOne scientist developed typhoid, and we had to ship her out.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The experience left Dr. Harvell wondering if the illnesses of the scientists might somehow be connected to those of the reefs. \xe2\x80\x9cIt just got me thinking about human health and environmental health and how they\xe2\x80\x99re linked,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'She discussed the idea with Dr. Lamb, who began to investigate.'b'Seagrass meadows can release so much oxygen that the surrounding water fizzes like champagne. That oxygen might be able to kill pathogens, Dr. Lamb realized. The plants also host fungi, which are known to producing bacteria-killing compounds.'b'Dr. Lamb and her colleagues decided to study sites around four islands in Indonesia with and without nearby seagrass. The scientists devised two strategies to search for pathogens.'b'In one survey, they collected seawater and put it in petri dishes to see if colonies of disease-causing bacteria known as Enterococcus grew from the samples. Levels of the bacteria in water from seagrass meadows, they found, were a third of the levels in water from other sites.'b'In a second search, the scientists grabbed fragments of DNA floating in seawater. By examining the sequences, they identified 18 kinds of disease-causing bacteria. Water from the seagrass meadows had only half the level of this DNA, compared with water collected at other sites.'b'The scientists next turned their attention to coral reefs around the islands. Reefs next to seagrass meadows, they found, were half as diseased as those without meadows.'b'Thorsten B. Reusch, a marine ecologist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Germany who was not involved in the study, called it \xe2\x80\x9ctruly fascinating and innovative.\xe2\x80\x9d He also warned that \xe2\x80\x9cit remains to be seen what the exact mechanisms of the pathogen removal are.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Lamb and her colleagues are now searching for those mechanisms. They\xe2\x80\x99re also trying to put a number on the value of seagrass\xe2\x80\x99s disease-fighting powers. \xe2\x80\x9cThere could be a huge potential in how valuable they become,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Lamb.'b'Robert J. Orth, a seagrass expert at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who was not involved in the new report, predicted it would lead to similar research on seagrass meadows in other parts of the world. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to make people think,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The growing recognition of this plant\xe2\x80\x99s importance comes even as it is disappearing. Nearly a third of the world\xe2\x80\x99s seagrass meadows have died off since the 19th century. A number of studies indicate that they are now disappearing at an accelerating pace.'b'Last week, Dr. Orth and his colleagues published 'b'a detailed study'b' of the retreat of seagrass in Chesapeake Bay in the journal Global Change Biology. Since just 1991, they estimate, 29 percent of the bay\xe2\x80\x99s seagrass meadows have vanished.'b'Their research points to two main culprits. Eroded dirt washes into the Chesapeake, making the water cloudy. Seagrass get so little sunlight that the resulting dimming can be deadly.'b'Seagrass is also being pummeled by climate change. Warmer summer temperatures in Chesapeake Bay cause the plants to lose much of their oxygen through their leaves. With less oxygen to pump into their roots, they are poisoned by toxic sediments.'b'The cloudiness of the water makes the heat even worse. With less sunlight, the plants produce even less protective oxygen to begin with. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a double whammy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Orth.'b'As the underwater meadows disappear, economic value disappears with them. The Chesapeake Bay meadows are a nursery for blue crabs, for example. Dr. Orth and his colleagues estimate that the seagrass die-off has eliminated more than 500 million juvenile blue crabs since 1991.'b'Seagrass meadows can store enormous amounts of carbon. Their soils don\xe2\x80\x99t decompose because they have very little oxygen in them. As a result, seagrass meadow soil around the world has accumulated 'b'an estimated nine'b''b' billion tons of carbon'b'.'b'As seagrass meadows disappear, that carbon is being released back into the ocean. Some of it may make its way into the atmosphere as heat-trapping carbon dioxide.'b'As dire as the situation has become, there is cause for hope. In recent years, Dr. Orth and his colleagues have successfully restored seagrass meadows off the coast of Virginia.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow we have 6,200 acres of seagrass,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere in 1997 there wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a single blade of grass.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'KAMPONG TRACH MOUNTAIN, Cambodia \xe2\x80\x94 Millions of years ago, a cluster of coral reefs stood firm here as the water receded, leaving them surrounded by the marshy, mangrove-studded Mekong Delta.'b'Today, these reefs have been carved by the wind and rain into spiky limestone cliffs known as karsts that stand stark against the Cambodian landscape, even as the lowland rain forest around them has been denuded by centuries of intensive rice cultivation and logging.'b'The karsts are full of nooks and crannies that have nurtured highly specialized plants and animals found nowhere else. They are also important to humans, studded with small altars and temples that are thought to be homes to neak ta, landscape spirits in the local animist pantheon.'b'Soon, they will be gone.'b'A small group of scientists are now racing to document rare plant life in these limestone karsts before local companies quarry them to dust and grind them up for production of the cement that is fueling this country\xe2\x80\x99s building boom.'b'Most of the wood in mainland Southeast Asia has already been logged to support the region\xe2\x80\x99s rapid economic growth and its relentless appetite for luxury hardwood. (Nearly all the forest cover in neighboring Thailand is gone and Cambodia is now experiencing 'b'the 'b''b'fastest acceleration'b' of forest loss in the world, despite a putative ban on logging.) Cement and concrete are also in high demand, so the karsts are next in line.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are the last refuges of what made it to the Mekong Delta, natural harbors for a specialized kind of vegetation that has very little timber value, sanctuaries of rare species,\xe2\x80\x9d said J. Andrew McDonald, a botany professor at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, who is spearheading the plant collection project with support from the International Union for Conservation of Nature.'b'The limestone habitats can act as \xe2\x80\x9carks\xe2\x80\x9d of biodiversity that replenish surrounding areas after ecological damage. But they are so complex that, once destroyed, they can never themselves be recreated.'b'They have scant access to water for six months of the year, creating a harsh, alkaline environment that has led to the evolution of desertlike flora in the middle of a hot, wet country. Dr. McDonald calls them \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Seuss-type plants,\xe2\x80\x9d ones that look and behave like cactuses and succulent desert flora, but are related to the local tropical foliage.'b'There are fat, succulent grapevines, fig trees with thick, waxy leaves, and false cactuses \xe2\x80\x94 as spiky and segmented as those that grow in the American desert, but actually members of the poinsettia family that evolved independently. Perhaps most unusual are the large, phallic flowers known as Amorphophallus, which look like a cross between an orchid and a Muppet\xe2\x80\x99s nose.'b'The toughest and most determined plants nestle themselves into the fissures and cracks atop the karsts, or cling to the razor-sharp outcroppings exposed to the wind and sun. More delicate tropical flowers \xe2\x80\x94 feathery orchids and little white touch-me-nots \xe2\x80\x94 make homes in the grottoes within, sucking up the water that drips through the limestone. At the bottom, the karsts are like Swiss cheese, full of water-carved pockets that open up into large underground lakes where rare bats feed and mushrooms grow.'b'Over four days in January, armed with rice sacks and pruning shears, Dr. McDonald and several colleagues and students pored over two linked karsts, Phnom Kampong Trach and Phnom Domrei, climbing atop their jagged surfaces and passing all the way through them in a network of caves.'b'Dr. McDonald, 62, is a plain-spoken Texan with a mystical streak who spends his spare time working on a 1,000-page manuscript on the religious iconography of the lotus. He can clamber up and down the slippery, precipitous karsts like one of the mountain goats that live here (another anomaly in flat Cambodia).'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFruits! Flowers! Fruits! Flowers! Eyes on the prize!\xe2\x80\x9d he chanted, trying to urge the group to collect specimens. Among the group was a pair of technophilic Vietnamese botanists lugging huge cameras who kept falling behind to take close-up shots of the foliage.'b'At first glance, Dr. McDonald was excited by a novel-looking parasitic Balanaflora with droopy, bulbous male flowers (\xe2\x80\x9cthey latch onto this tree and have sex there\xe2\x80\x9d) and a huge, feathery white blossom at the edge of a grotto. It was an unusual variant of dogbane, a nocturnal plant with a dangling structure that dusts the underside of a visiting moth or bat with pollen. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen an Apocynaceae with an irregular flower like that!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, before gingerly tossing the specimens, one by one, across a huge fissure to the safe hands of a waiting colleague.'b'Ultimately, over the course of two botanical excursions, the group found more than 130 species of vascular plants native to this patch of limestone, a comparatively rich assortment, including some thought to be new to science: an Amorphophallus and another related flower, a new type of jasmine, and a member of the coffee family.'b'Along with discovering these rare species, the scientists wanted to document the karsts\xe2\x80\x99s biodiversity and the ways in which different parts of the habitat work together before it is gone. Ultimately, they hope to persuade the government to make these two karsts a protected area and declare them off-limits to future cement quarrying.'b'The team was accompanied by a representative of the Ministry of Environment who was to report back to his superiors on the merits of the protection proposal. The ministry is bereft of plant experts, so they sent Neang Thy, the country\xe2\x80\x99s leading herpetologist, instead.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe vegetation you see here, you may not see anywhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is destroyed, that is a problem.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He said he hoped future trips would allow for a survey of animal life in the karsts. Similar limestone formations in Vietnam and Thailand are home to novel species of fish, lizards, crabs and insects that adapt to life inside caves by becoming pale, blind and wingless, often looking very different from their aboveground brethren.'b'There are highly biodiverse karsts scattered across Southeast Asia, from Vietnam to Borneo, like desert islands surrounded by oceans of tropical rain forest. The destruction of karsts at the hands of cement companies, developers and tourists is a problem throughout the region.'b'But it is particularly acute here, where government regulation is lax and the state of local scientific knowledge fledgling.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are threatened, as they are elsewhere, but the difference is that there is almost nothing known about the biodiversity of the hills\xe2\x80\x9d in Cambodia, said Tony Whitten, the international regional director for Fauna and Flora International\xe2\x80\x99s Asia-Pacific division, who coedited a book on the subject \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cBiodiversity and Cultural Property in the Management of Limestone Resources: Lessons from East Asia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cambodia has almost no botanists and the study of plants in the country came to a standstill from 1970 to 1992 during an extended period of war and unrest punctuated by the trauma of the Khmer Rouge takeover from 1975 to 1979.'b'The country\xe2\x80\x99s main herbarium is a single room at the Royal University of Phnom Penh. It houses about 12,000 specimens, many of which have not been inventoried and are simply piling up on shelves. They are meant to be kept cool and dry by two air-conditioners, but one air-conditioner is broken and there is no money to fix it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou talk about a herbarium in another country and it should be very big, but this is just one room,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ith Saveng, who runs the university\xe2\x80\x99s Center for Biodiversity Conservation. \xe2\x80\x9cWe hope to expand to another room within the next two years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Rare plants found in karsts have to be shipped to Vietnam so better-trained scientists can do the precise work of matching species to species.'b'In Kampot, the scientists were led through some of the more treacherous cave networks by Ken Sam An, a 61-year-old native of a village just below the Phnom Kampong Trach karst. He knows more about these caves than just about anyone else. As a teenager, he watched as the Viet Cong hid in the caves, resulting in retaliatory bombing campaigns by the United States that drove the population to flee. Soon, ultra-Communist rebels swept into the area and he was conscripted into a Khmer Rouge youth unit.'b'Whatever scientific research apparatus still existed was totally dismantled by the victorious Khmer Rouge government, which declared higher education anathema and sent city dwellers back to the land to work as rice farmers and dam builders. Although Mr. Ken Sam An possesses vast botanical knowledge, he has not attended school since the sixth grade.'b'After the fall of the Khmer Rouge in 1979, Mr. Ken Sam An spent years working for a limestone quarrying company, but now he serves on a local committee that tries to preserve the karsts, urging local residents to stop stripping them and chopping off rocks to sell.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI tell them, \xe2\x80\x98If you break the mountain, it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for the environment, and if you work in tourism you can come and sell things to the tourists instead of breaking rocks.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A far bigger risk is large-scale limestone quarrying by companies producing cement. Kampot (K) Cement, a joint venture between the well-connected local company Khaou Chuly Group and the Thai cement manufacturer Siam Cement, has claim to large karsts in the area. The site is churning out a million tons of cement a year.'b'Another local company, Chip Mong, formed a partnership with a different Thai firm and started building a $262 million factory in the area last year, with the goal of producing 1.5 million tons a year. This is still not enough to slake Cambodia\xe2\x80\x99s growing thirst for cement, expected to reach five million tons this year.'b'The cement firms have also spawned a mini-land boom in Kampot, where prices have risen thirtyfold in the last decade, according to locals. In interviews, the inhabitants complained that rocks being blasted off the mountains were falling on their homes and angering the local neak ta, who had to be propitiated with offerings of roast pigs.'b'Dr. Whitten said he had tried for years, fruitlessly, to determine whether environmental impact assessments had been carried out before cement companies were given permission to dynamite the karsts. The Ministry of Mines and Energy, which is responsible for granting and regulating concessions for limestone quarrying, declined to comment.'b'Even when environmental assessments are conducted, they often focus on large mammals, overlooking plants and small species that are highly endemic to certain caves. The slimy, squishy invertebrates and strange plants that live in karsts can be a hard sell to donors, who prefer what are known as \xe2\x80\x9ccharismatic megafauna\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 cute, easy-to-anthropomorphize animals like elephants, tigers and dolphins that appeal to the public.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt takes a botanist to appreciate the charisma of a plant,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. McDonald said.'b'The karsts his group wants to protect have the advantage of already being a minor tourist attraction, with a Buddhist pagoda sprawling out at their feet, small shrines nestled into the caves and a set of stone steps leading down to an underground pond where monks bathe.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are linked together \xe2\x80\x94 people come to pray at the pagoda and then they always go to the cave,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ken Sam An said. It is also common for him and his neighbors to make offerings to the spirits believed to inhabit the karsts, going to different caves on different holy days. Each one is believed to be the domain of a different neak ta.'b'Mr. Ken Sam An can rattle off their names as if they are members of his extended family: \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the Red Neck spirit, the Eight Heads spirit, the spirit of the 100 Rice Fields, the spirit of the Monk Who Lives in the Jungle, the White Elephant spirit, the Dragon\xe2\x80\x99s Mouth spirit, the Magic Boy spirit, the Reincarnated Grandmother spirit and the Magic Mushroom spirit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Altogether, the caves are thought by locals to be chambers in the stomach of a dragon that beached here when an ancient sea receded thousands of years ago \xe2\x80\x94 a tale not entirely different from the stories told by geologists and botanists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what we lose when they take out a mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. McDonald said.'b'There is a crisis brewing in the cosmos, or perhaps in the community of cosmologists. The universe seems to be expanding too fast, some astronomers say.'b'Recent measurements of the distances and velocities of faraway galaxies don\xe2\x80\x99t agree with a hard-won \xe2\x80\x9cstandard model\xe2\x80\x9d of the cosmos that has prevailed for the past two decades.'b'The latest result shows a 9 percent discrepancy in the value of a long-sought number called the Hubble constant, which describes how fast the universe is expanding. But in a measure of how precise cosmologists think their science has become, this small mismatch has fostered a debate about just how well we know the cosmos.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is real, we will learn new physics,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Wendy Freedman'b' of the University of Chicago, who has spent most of her career charting the size and growth of the universe.'b'The Hubble constant, named after Edwin Hubble, the Mount Wilson and Carnegie Observatories astronomer who discovered that the universe is expanding, has ever given astronomers fits. In an expanding universe, the farther something is away from you, the faster it is receding. Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s constant tells by how much.'b'But measuring it requires divining the distances of lights in the sky \xe2\x80\x94 stars and even whole galaxies that we can never visit or recreate in the lab. The strategy since Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s day has been to find so-called standard candles, stars or whole galaxies whose distances can be calculated by how bright they look from Earth.'b'But the calibrators themselves need to be calibrated, which has led to a rickety chain of assumptions and measurements in which small errors and disagreements \xe2\x80\x94 about, say, how much dust is interfering with observations \xe2\x80\x94 can build up to cosmic proportions. Only three decades ago, renowned astronomers could not agree on whether the universe was 10 billion or 20 billion years old. Now everybody has settled on its age as about 13.8 billion years.'b'Using a new generation of instruments like the 'b'Hubble Space Telescope'b', 'b'astronomers have steadily whittled'b''b' down'b' the uncertainty in the Hubble constant.'b'In 2001, a team led by Dr. Freedman reported a value of 72 kilometers per second per megaparsec (about 3.3 million lightyears), in the galumphing units astronomers prefer. It meant that for every 3.3 million lightyears a galaxy was farther away from us, it was moving 72 kilometers a second faster.'b'Hubble\xe2\x80\x99s original estimate was much higher, at 500 in the same units of measurement.'b'Dr. Freedman\xe2\x80\x99s result had an error margin that left it happily consistent with other more indirect calculations, that had gotten a slightly slower and lower value of 67 for the Hubble constant. Those were derived from studies of microwaves emitted and still lingering in the sky from the the primordial Big Bang fireball.'b'As a result, in recent years, astronomers have settled on a recipe for the universe that is as black and as decadent as a double dark chocolate chunk brownie. The universe consists of roughly 5 percent atomic matter by weight, 27 percent mysterious 'b'dark matter'b' and 68 percent of the even more mysterious 'b'dark energy'b' that is speeding up the cosmic expansion. Never mind that we don\xe2\x80\x99t know exactly what all this dark stuff is. Astronomers have a good theory about how it behaves, and that has allowed them to tell a plausible story about how the universe evolved from when it was a trillionth of a second old until today.'b'But now the Hubble precision has gotten seemingly better, and the universe might be in trouble again.'b'Last summer a team led by 'b'Adam Riess'b' of Johns Hopkins University and the Space Telescope Science Institute, using the 'b'Hubble Space Telescope'b' and the giant 'b'Keck Telescope'b' on 'b'Mauna Kea in Hawaii'b' and supernova explosions as the ultimate distance markers, got a value of 73 plus or minus only 2.4 percent for the elusive constant.'b'That made waves because it meant that, if true, the Hubble constant as observed today was now clearly incompatible with a result of the lower slower value of 67 inferred from data obtained in 2013 by the European Planck spacecraft of relic radiation from the Big Bang. The 'b'Planck mission'b' observations that show the universe when it was only 380,000 years old are considered the gold standard of cosmology.'b'Whether the standard cosmic recipe might now need to be modified \xe2\x80\x94 for example, to account for a new species of subatomic particles streaming through space from the Big Bang \xe2\x80\x94 depends on whom you talk to. Some say it is too soon to get excited about new physics sneaking through such a small discrepancy in a field noted for controversy. With more data and better understanding of statistical uncertainties, the discrepancy might disappear, they say.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo explanation I know of is less ugly than the problem,\xe2\x80\x9d Lawrence M. Krauss, a theorist at Arizona State, said.'b'Others say this could be the beginning of something big. David Spergel, a cosmologist at Princeton and the Simons Foundation, called the discrepancy \xe2\x80\x9cvery intriguing,\xe2\x80\x9d but said he was not yet convinced that this was the signature of new physics. Michael S. Turner of the University of Chicago said, \xe2\x80\x9cIf the discrepancy is real, this could be a disruption of the current highly successful standard model of cosmology and just what the younger generation wants \xe2\x80\x94 a chance for big discoveries, new insights and breakthroughs.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Riess and his colleague Stefano Casertano got roughly the same answer of 73later last summer, strengthening the claim for a mismatch of Hubble constants. They used early data from the European spacecraft GAIA, which is measuring the distances of more than a billion stars by triangulation, thus allowing astronomers to skip some of the lower rungs on the distance ladder.'b'They calculated that the odds of this mismatch being a statistical fluke were less than one part in a hundred \xe2\x80\x94 which might sound good in poker but not in physics, which requires odds of less than one in a million to cement a claim of a discovery.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s a potentially serious issue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Alex Filippenko, a University of California astronomer who is part of the team. \xe2\x80\x9cIn this line of research the devil is in the details. And after getting the details right, we\xe2\x80\x99re left with a major puzzle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'George Efstathiou, of the University of Cambridge and one of the leaders of the Planck mission responsible for its cosmological analysis, said Dr. Riess and his team had underestimated the errors in their measurement.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo, in summary, I think that the Planck results are secure,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in an email. \xe2\x80\x9cThey,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the other astronomers, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be right and we have to modify their standard model, but the evidence looks weak to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Riess and his colleagues have stood by their work, however, and the plot thickened further in December when a group called H0LiCOW (don\xe2\x80\x99t ask) from the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany, reported its own value of 72 for the Hubble constant, also inconsistent with the Planck space mission\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.'b'Led by Sherry Suyu of Max Planck, the group measured the delays experienced by light rays from five distant flickering quasars as they followed different paths around massive galaxies on the way from Out There to us. . The technique, they say, depends only on geometry and Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s theory of gravity, general relativity, making it independent of other assumptions about dust or the makeup of stars.'b'Last year, a group known as BOSS, the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, came up with a Hubble constant of about 68, based on how 1.5 million galaxies were clustered in space and time, but it used data from the cosmic microwave background for calibration.'b'There is wiggle room, Dr. Riess and others say, for both the modern and the primordial results to be right, because Planck measures the Hubble constant only indirectly as one of several parameters in the standard model of the universe. Other parameters could be tweaked.'b'That is where new physics might come in.'b'The most likely candidates to fill the gap, Dr. Riess said, might be a new form of the ghostly particles called 'b'neutrinos'b', already known to be abundant in the cosmos. They come in 'b'three types'b' that can change into one another as they traverse space; some physicists have suggested there could be a fourth kind, called sterile neutrinos, that don\xe2\x80\x99t interact with anything at all.'b'Their discovery could unlock new realms in particle physics and perhaps shed light, so to speak, on the quest to understand the dark matter that suffuses space and provides the gravitational scaffolding for galaxies.'b'Another possibility is that the most popular version of dark energy \xe2\x80\x94 known as the cosmological constant, invented by Einstein 100 years ago and then rejected as a blunder \xe2\x80\x94 might have to be replaced in the cosmological model by a more virulent and controversial form known as phantom energy, which could cause the universe to eventually expand so fast that even atoms would be torn apart in a Big Rip billions of years from now.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a very interesting tension,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Riess said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is why we play the game. We look for something not fitting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added, \xe2\x80\x9cClues about the dark sector or about fundamental physics are in play.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the age of \xe2\x80\x9cprecision cosmology,\xe2\x80\x9d and while everybody agrees that it is still too soon to tell, the avalanche of data from GAIA and the coming 'b'James Webb Space Telescope'b' is just beginning, Dr. Freedman said. In the next few years she hopes the Hubble constant can be measured to 1 percent accuracy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s what makes it interesting \xe2\x80\x94 this is feasible, and a lot of work is now ongoing that will allow us to resolve this within the next couple of years,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s what makes me want to work on this again!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She said the situation reminded her of the late 1990s, when discrepant distances to distant supernova explosions led to the discovery that the expansion of the universe was accelerating under the 'b'influence of dark energy'b'. Dr. Riess won a 'b'Nobel P'b''b'rize'b' for his part in that, and dark energy took its place in cosmic orthodoxy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not quite \xe2\x80\x98d\xc3\xa9j\xc3\xa0 vu,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in an email, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it\xe2\x80\x99s funny that whenever my colleagues and I look at the contemporary universe with our radar guns, it\xe2\x80\x99s expanding too fast for the contemporary expectations!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, is among the elite of American scientists, with a tenured position at the University of California, Berkeley, and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his 'b'research on fruit flies'b'.'b'But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration\xe2\x80\x99s apparent disdain for evidence on 'b'climate change'b' and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle 'b'@SenatorPhD'b' and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California.

But there is much that is still unclear about his administration\xe2\x80\x99s attitudes toward science.'b'The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to 'b'open letters'b' calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (whose president, Rush D. Holt, is a physicist and former congressman).'b'Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are many conversations going on right now,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Naomi Oreskes'b', a historian of science at Harvard who spoke at one of the first scientist-led anti-Trump protests, a rally in San Francisco during the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. \xe2\x80\x9cMany scientists do feel that the time for sitting on the sidelines is past.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office, 'b'314 Action'b', has seen a surge of interest in its programs, with more than 2,000 people registering at its website. The group is planning a training program for scientist-candidates, whether they want to run for local or state offices or Congress.'b'Other scientists have organized demonstrations \xe2\x80\x94 including a 'b'march'b' now set for 'b'Earth Day'b', April 22 \xe2\x80\x94 submitted letters or opinion articles to news organizations or joined efforts to preserve government data that they fear may otherwise disappear. Individuals and groups have also spoken out against Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order restricting travel for citizens of Iran, Iraq and five other countries, an action that has affected some researchers.'b'But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have plenty of colleagues who say, \xe2\x80\x98Leave me alone in my lab,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Jonathan Overpeck'b', director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight now it\xe2\x80\x99s mostly talking about what to do,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re scientists \xe2\x80\x94 we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there\xe2\x80\x99s an elevated sense that this is very real.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in \xe2\x80\x9cdata rescue\xe2\x80\x9d events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department.'b'An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called 'b'Data Refuge'b'. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor a problem like climate change, you can\xe2\x80\x99t understand it if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have data,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the loose-knit group 'b'Environmental Data Governance Initiative'b', which sponsored the N.Y.U. event.'b'Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E.P.A., which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency\xe2\x80\x99s science staff.'b'Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E.P.A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a great believer in science,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ebell said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I\xe2\x80\x99m not a great believer in politicized science.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and long-held view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself.'b'Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda.'b'But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that many people have moved well beyond that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Andrew Rosenberg, director of the 'b'Center for Science and Democracy'b' at the Union of Concerned Scientists, which is enlisting scientists to monitor what is occurring in federal agencies. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense \xe2\x80\x94 you need to follow your own heart.

If they manage that feat, the passengers would be the first humans to venture that far into space in more than 40 years.'b'Mr. Musk made the announcement on Monday in a telephone news conference. He said two private individuals approached the company to see if SpaceX would be willing to send them on a weeklong cruise, which would fly past the surface of the 'b'moon'b' \xe2\x80\x94 but not land \xe2\x80\x94 and continue outward before gravity turned the spacecraft around and brought it back to Earth for a landing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis would do a long loop around the moon,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Musk said. The company is aiming to launch this moon mission in late 2018.'b'The two people would spend about a week inside one of SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s Dragon 2 capsules, launched on SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'Falcon Heavy'b' rocket. The spacecraft would be automated, but the travelers would undergo training for emergencies.'b'Mr. Musk did not say how much the travelers would pay for the ride. \xe2\x80\x9cA little bit more than the cost of a crewed mission to the space station would be,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The Falcon Heavy itself has a list price of $90 million.'b'While the trip appears to be within the technical capabilities of SpaceX, industry experts wondered whether the company could pull it off as quickly as Mr. Musk indicated. \xe2\x80\x9cDates are not SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s strong suit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mary Lynne Dittmar, executive director of the Coalition for Deep Space Exploration, a space advocacy group consisting of aerospace companies. The Dragon 2 and Falcon Heavy are years behind schedule and have yet to fly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt strikes me as risky,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Dittmar said, adding that autonomous systems are not infallible. \xe2\x80\x9cI find it extraordinary that these sorts of announcements are being made when SpaceX has yet to get crew from the ground to low-Earth orbit.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Last week, a crewless Dragon capsule taking cargo to the International Space Station aborted its rendezvous because of a glitch. It 'b'successfully arrived'b' a day later.'b'Mr. Musk said the two would-be private space travelers wished to remain anonymous for now. He declined to describe them, except to say they knew each other.'b'Seven space tourists have paid tens of millions of dollars to fly on Russian Soyuz rockets to visit the International Space Station, which is about 200 miles above the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. This would be a much more distant trip. The moon is about a quarter million miles away, and the trajectory would take the capsule 300,000 to 400,000 miles from Earth.'b'No astronauts have ventured beyond low-Earth orbit since the last of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Apollo moon landings in 1972. NASA is working on a rocket, the 'b'Space Launch Sy'b''b's'b''b'tem'b', and a capsule, Orion, that would be capable of taking astronauts to deep space once again.'b'But that first launch, without anyone on board, is scheduled for late next year, taking a path similar to what Mr. Musk has proposed for his space tourists.'b'This month, 'b'NASA announced'b' it is looking at the possibility of putting astronauts on the first flight, but officials say that would probably delay the launch to 2019.'b'The rocket that SpaceX would use for the voyage is more powerful than its current 'b'Falcon 9 workhorse'b', but not as large as NASA\xe2\x80\x99s.'b'When Mr. Musk announced the Falcon Heavy in 2011, he said it would fly in 2013. The maiden flight is now scheduled for this summer.'b'SpaceX has a contract to take NASA astronauts to the International Space Station using the Dragon 2 capsule launched on the Falcon 9 rocket. That program has also encountered delays.'b'SpaceX is scheduled to launch a crewless test flight this year and take its few NASA passengers next spring, although 'b'a report by the Government Accountability Office'b' has cast doubt that SpaceX would be able to do it that quickly.'b'NASA has financed much of SpaceX\xe2\x80\x99s spacecraft development, and Mr. Musk said the agency has priority. If NASA wants to put its astronauts on the Falcon Heavy\xe2\x80\x99s first moon flight, he said, SpaceX will comply. But the Falcon Heavy has not been through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous reviews to be judged safe for astronauts.'b'Deep in the Amazon, the rain forest once covered ancient secrets. Spread across hundreds of thousands of acres are massive, 'b'geometric earthworks'b'. The carvings stretch out in circles and squares that can be as big as a city block, with trenches up to 12 yards wide and 13 feet deep. They appear to have been built up to 2,000 years ago.'b'Were the broken ceramics found near the entrances used for ritual sacrifices? Why were they here? The answer remains a mystery.'b'For centuries, the enigmatic structures remained hidden to all but a few archaeologists. Then in the 1980s, 'b'ranchers'b' cleared land to raise cattle, uncovering the true extent of the earthworks in the process. 'b'More than 450'b' of these geoglyphs are concentrated within Acre State in Brazil.'b'Since the discovery, archaeological study of the earthworks and other evidence has challenged the notion that the rain forests of the Amazon were untouched by human hands before the arrival of European explorers in the 15th century. And while the true purpose of the geoglyphs remains unknown, a study 'b'published'b' on Monday in 'b'The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'b' offers new insight into the lives of the ancient people who lived in the Amazon. Thousands of years before the earthworks were built, humans were managing the forests, using what appear to be sustainable agricultural practices.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur study was looking at the environmental impact that the geoglyph builders had on the landscape,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Jennifer Watling'b', an archaeologist at the University of S\xc3\xa3o Paulo, Brazil, who conducted the research while a student at the University of Exeter in Britain. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people have the idea that the Amazon forests are pristine forests, never touched by humans, and that\xe2\x80\x99s obviously not the case.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Dr. Watling and her team reconstructed a 6,000-year-old environmental history of two geoglyph sites in the Amazon rain forest. To do this, they searched for clues in soil samples in and around the sites. Microscopic plant fossils called phytoliths told them about ancient vegetation. Bits of charcoal revealed evidence of burnings. And a kind of carbon dating gave them a sense of how open the vegetation had been in the past.'b'About 4,000 years ago, people started burning the forest, which was mostly bamboo, just enough to make small openings. They may have planted maize or squash, weeded out some underbrush, and transported seeds or saplings to create a partly curated forest of useful tree products that Dr. Watling calls a \xe2\x80\x9cprehistoric supermarket.\xe2\x80\x9d After that, they started building the geoglyphs. The presence of just a few artifacts, and the layout of the earthworks, suggest they weren\xe2\x80\x99t used as ancient villages or for military defenses. They were likely built for rituals, some archaeologists suspect.'b'Dr. Watling and her colleagues found that in contrast with the large-scale deforestation we see today \xe2\x80\x94 which 'b'threatens'b' about 20 percent of the largest rain forest in the world \xe2\x80\x94 ancient indigenous people of the Amazon practiced something more akin to what we now call agroforestry. They restricted burns to site locations and maintained the surrounding landscape, creating small, temporary clearings in the bamboo and promoting the growth of plants like palm, cedar and Brazil nut that were, and still are, useful commodities. Today, indigenous groups around the world continue these sustainable practices in forests.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndigenous communities have actually transformed the ecosystem over a very long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dr. Watling. \xe2\x80\x9cThe modern forest owes its biodiversity to the agroforestry practices that were happening during the time of the geoglyph builders.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One day when L. J. Krumenacker was a teenager, he left his home to hunt for fossils. He drove about an hour and a half to Paris Canyon in Bear Lake County in southeastern Idaho and stopped at a foothill covered in sagebrush. Mr. Krumenacker got out of his car, picked up the first large rock he saw and smashed it with a hammer, uncovering seven or eight fossilized shark teeth.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI did a double take. I thought, \xe2\x80\x98No, this is impossible.\xe2\x80\x99 But they really were shark teeth,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Krumenacker said. \xe2\x80\x9cImmediately I thought this spot was important because you don\xe2\x80\x99t go out and randomly find 250-million-year-old shark teeth on accident.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What Mr. Krumenacker didn\xe2\x80\x99t know was that he had stumbled upon a fossil treasure trove that contained clues to how life bounced back after the largest mass extinction on Earth. The cataclysmic event, known as \xe2\x80\x9cthe Great Dying,\xe2\x80\x9d occurred about 252 million years ago, ending the Permian Period.'b'It was more devastating than the event that 'b'annihilated the dinosaurs'b' some 186 million years later. Scientists think it may have been caused by intense volcanic activity that released tremendous amounts of carbon dioxide, heating the planet and acidifying the oceans. And the fossils Mr. Krumenacker first stumbled upon in Paris Canyon may be a sign that life on Earth recovered much more quickly than previously known.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomething in the neighborhood of 90 percent of species went extinct,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Daniel Stephen'b', a paleontologist at Utah Valley University and an author of the paper that appeared in 'b'Science Advances'b' on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x9cJust imagine you go outside, look around you and nine out of 10 of every life form you see around you have vanished.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though Mr. Krumenacker believed the fossil site was important, it took him more than a decade to draw professional paleontologists to Idaho. Since his first find, Mr. Krumenacker, who is now a 'b'doctoral student'b' at Montana State University, made frequent trips back to the Paris Canyon site and uncovered shrimp and sponge fossils. These soft-bodied specimens typically don\xe2\x80\x99t fossilize well, but the ones he collected were pristinely preserved. They were just the discoveries he needed to attract the attention of other paleontologists and finally organize a professional dig.'b'Now, about 20 years after Mr. Krumenacker found the shark teeth, he and a team of researchers have identified more than 750 individual specimens at Paris Canyon, including ancient squids, lobsters, fish and other marine creatures. By dating the rocks at the site, they determined that the location was part of a thriving underwater ecosystem some 250 million years ago, only about 1.3 million years after the Great Dying. Most previous research had suggested that it took between 10 million and 20 million years for ecosystems to recover.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo build these diverse ecosystems, you\xe2\x80\x99re almost starting from scratch from the mass extinction event,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Stephen said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe information that my colleagues and I have gathered tell us that at least in some places the recovery was relatively rapid.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The marine life at this location may have been as bustling and flourishing as a healthy coral reef today. There would have been seven-foot-long sharks swimming among squidlike creatures with tentacles that had hooks, and armored cephalopods with coiled shells called ammonites sharing the sea with mollusks in shells shaped like ice cream cones. There might have also been dolphinlike marine reptiles called ichthyosaurs and schools of bony fish. The ocean floor would have been covered in scavenging shrimp and lobsters, as well as sponges, clams and ancient starfish relatives that stood on stems and resembled underwater flowers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fairly remarkable just because it\xe2\x80\x99s so diverse,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Krumenacker said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re roughly a million years after the worst extinction in the history of the planet and we have this diverse ecosystem. It\xe2\x80\x99s much earlier than people thought.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Off the coast of the island of Hawaii, hundreds of millions of gallons of lava are flowing into the ocean like blood from a ruptured artery. Starting in January at 'b'K\xc4\xablauea Volcano'b'\xe2\x80\x99s Kamokuna ocean entry, the lava hit the salty water, shooting molten rock upward and outward, accompanied by a rising, steamy cloud of acid.'b'Normally cooling lava would stack up, creating a rocky shelf on which the lava settles called a lava delta. But this time, the flow continued to gush nearly 100 feet down, into the sea, for a whole month.'b'This same volcano has sent lava traveling through tubes from moving vents along its 'b'East Rift Zone known as Pu\xe2\x80\x98u \xe2\x80\x98\xc5\x8c\xe2\x80\x98\xc5\x8d'b', ever since it erupted 34 years ago. And these tubes have carried it to a number of spots along the ocean. But streams like this usually only last a day or two. This one lasted from New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve, when 21 acres of lava delta 'b'collapsed into the ocean'b', exposing the tube, until Thursday, when an unstable seacliff collapsed and finally cut off the picturesque stream.'b'On Wednesday the USGS Hawaiian Volcano Observatory noted that 'b'the sea cliff just near the entry was becoming increasingly unstable'b', and could collapse at any moment. By 6 p.m. E.T. Thursday, a crack in the seacliff split open and 'b'it fell into the sea'b'. Lava is still flowing into the ocean, said 'b'Janet Babb'b', a geologist at the observatory, who monitors the volcano, in an email Thursday night. But she was uncertain that the fire hose flow was still visible.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs I like to say, the only constant on this volcano is change,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Babb said.'b''b'Photos'b' and 'b'videos'b' of this spectacular lava flow into the ocean spread on social media this week. Flowing from Kilauea at a rate of about one or two cubic meters a second, somewhere between 788 million gallons and 1.576 billion gallons of lava flowed from Kilauea Volcano into the ocean during the firehose\xe2\x80\x99s monthlong show.'b'Why did this lava fire hose last so long?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing we can surmise is the offshore topography apparently is so steep that, as the lava is flowing in and forming all this new rubble, it\xe2\x80\x99s just slipping down into deeper parts of the ocean and not piling up to form a new delta,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Babb said ahead of the cliff collapse on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cLava will continue to flow into the ocean until it\xe2\x80\x99s disrupted.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The geological events that led up to the fire hose started long before the new year.'b'In May 2016, a new vent broke out on Pu\xe2\x80\x98u \xe2\x80\x98\xc5\x8c\xe2\x80\x98\xc5\x8d. Lava started flowing and moving south toward the coast. As the lava moved, the part touching the air cooled and crusted over, resulting in lava tubes that made its passage to the ocean far more efficient, as veins channel blood. The tubes from this volcano range in diameter: from so fat that a bus could pass through to so skinny that a human couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'The lava traveled seven miles down these tubes, and by July 26, 2016, the lava had reached the ocean. At the time, that was big news, said Ms. Babb, because that was the first ocean entry since 2013.'b'When hot lava hits salty water it results in a chemical explosion. Rubble forms, stacks up, and lava mounds up over it creating a lava delta. Over four months between July and December, this lava built a 24-acre delta.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLava deltas are inherently unstable because they\xe2\x80\x99re built on a foundation of rubble,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Babb. They noticed cracks developing in the delta.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve the inevitable happened. The lava delta collapsed,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Four acres of seacliff beside the delta and near an area that can get thousands of daily visitors also 'b'crumbled into the ocean'b' below.'b'When park rangers saw what was happening, they moved the viewing area farther away and actually had to 'b'turn people back'b' who had ventured into the closed area 'b'minutes'b' before the collapse.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest feeling was a gratitude that no one was injured or killed during the 'b'collapse'b',\xe2\x80\x9d said Ms. Babb.'b'The fire hose of lava was beautiful, and dangerous. When the 2,100 degree Fahrenheit lava hits 70 degree salt water, it results in an explosive reaction that sends rock, glass and fragments of molten lava called spatter onto the land and out to the sea, where it endangers wildlife, hikers and tour boats. Dangerous waves form and the heat alone can boil fish that can\xe2\x80\x99t escape it alive.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat big white steam plume looks rather harmless, but it\xe2\x80\x99s a superheated steam laced with hydrochloric acid,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and a delta collapse magnifies the danger.'b'Park rangers determine safe viewing areas for patrons with observations carried out by the team at the observatory, but safety isn\xe2\x80\x99t guaranteed. Those interested in viewing the flow in person can follow the observatory\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'daily eruption updates'b' and 'b'photos'b', or check out the 'b'park\xe2\x80\x99s website'b' and remain cautious.'b'SAN FELIPE, Mexico \xe2\x80\x94 In the shallow sea waters of the Gulf of California swims a porpoise that few have seen, its numbers dwindling so fast that its very existence is now in peril.'b'Known mostly by its Spanish name, the snub-nosed vaquita is the world\xe2\x80\x99s smallest cetacean, a miniature porpoise with a cartoonlike features and dark smudges around its eyes. The species lives only in the fertile waters of the gulf\xe2\x80\x99s northern corner.'b'The size of its population has always been precarious, but now voracious demand in China for a fish that shares the vaquita\xe2\x80\x99s only habitat has pushed the tiny porpoise to the brink of extinction.'b''b'No more than 30 vaquitas are left'b', according to a November estimate based on monitoring of their echolocation clicks. Half of the vaquitas counted a year earlier have disappeared.'b'This calamity has hardly gone unnoticed. The vaquita has been vanishing in plain sight, to the despair of conservationists who have been advising the Mexican government on how to save it. All of the resources brought to bear, including the protection of the Mexican Navy, have proved to be no match against the illegal wildlife trade.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we continue on the path we\xe2\x80\x99re on, we\xe2\x80\x99ll have no vaquitas in two years,\xe2\x80\x9d said Barbara Taylor, a marine mammal expert at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.'b'The vaquita are simply bycatch, trapped and drowned in curtains of illegal gillnets set for an endangered fish called the totoaba. The fish\xe2\x80\x99s swim bladder is dried and smuggled to China, where wealthy diners pay thousands of dollars for the delicacy, believing it to have medicinal powers.'b'To feed that appetite, totoaba poachers have killed 90 percent of the vaquita population since 2011, according to the acoustic monitoring program led by Armando Jaramillo Legorreta at the Mexican government\xe2\x80\x99s National Ecology and Climate Change Institute, known as INECC.'b'With so few vaquitas left, experts advising the Mexican government have proposed capturing several specimens and holding them in a sea pen as a way of conserving the species until the threat to its habitat is removed. It\xe2\x80\x99s a last-ditch measure that conservationists had hoped they would never have to resort to.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe had always been opposed to captivity,\xe2\x80\x9d said Lorenzo Rojas Bracho, a marine mammal expert at INECC and the chairman of an advisory group, the International Committee for Vaquita Recovery. But nobody expected that the population would decline so quickly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are risks,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Rojas Bracho said of the capture plan. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they are fewer than leaving them with the fishing as it is.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The plan would entail training United States Navy dolphins to locate vaquitas, capturing them for transfer to a temporary pool and then to a sea pen to be built in their habitat along the Gulf of California coast. The majority of vaquitas would remain in the wild.'b'But the unknowns loom large. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether they find them,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Taylor said of the dolphins. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether we can catch them. We don\xe2\x80\x99t know how they will react.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you get a negative result in any one of these steps,\xe2\x80\x9d she added, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s basically game over\xe2\x80\x9d for the capture plan. Even in the best of scenarios, breeding in captivity is unlikely to restore the population. A female vaquita gives birth to one calf every two years on average.'b'If the proposal goes forward, the vaquita would join other species at the brink of extinction \xe2\x80\x94 like the California condor and the golden lion tamarin, in Brazil \xe2\x80\x94 that are being closely managed in some form distinct from their natural setting. It would be the first such effort for a marine mammal.'b'A very small population can be pulled back from the edge, but \xe2\x80\x9cit requires outside-the-box thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d said Samuel Turvey, a research fellow at the Zoological Society of London who studies conservation management for highly threatened species.'b'A managed-conservation plan designed with the expectation that the animals can eventually be returned to the wild \xe2\x80\x9cis not a permanent solution,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an emergency stopgap with an exit strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nor would it be a quick fix. \xe2\x80\x9cIt requires intensive sustained efforts for decades to recover species from these catastrophic low levels,\xe2\x80\x9d said Richard Young, the head of conservation science at the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust .'b'Dr. Turvey speaks from experience. He witnessed the first human-caused extinction of a cetacean, the Yangtze River dolphin. Like the vaquita, the baiji, as it was more commonly known, occupied a limited habitat in small numbers and was decimated as bycatch in local fisheries.'b'For a decade, researchers discussed removing individual baiji to a semi-natural reserve as a short-term conservation measure. But when Dr. Turvey and other researchers led an expedition down the Yangtze in 2006 to look for specimens, 'b'they found none'b'.'b'The baiji \xe2\x80\x9conly became a story when it was gone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, adding that \xe2\x80\x9cit was really dark and upsetting.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It is an experience that Dr. Taylor, who was on the expedition, hopes not to repeat. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s idealistic to think that we\xe2\x80\x99re going to effect the significant changes in fisheries and enforcement practices in the wild in time to save vaquitas,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'If anything, those efforts have reached a nadir.'b'Two years ago, the Mexican government imposed a two-year ban on all gillnets across 5,000 square miles of the vaquita habitat and sent its Navy to enforce it. To support the communities of the upper Gulf, which depend on fishing and shrimping, the government allocated $74 million in compensation over the two years.'b'The hope was that the military could halt the totoaba trade and that two years would be long enough to complete development of vaquita-safe trawl nets to substitute for shrimp gillnets. (Even before the totoaba trade surged, legal gillnet fishing had depleted the vaquita population.)'b'But local fishermen argue that the new nets\xe2\x80\x99 catches are too meager to provide a living, and the authorities have been sympathetic. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile there is no alternative to fishing practices, nobody will give up their gillnets,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Rojas Bracho said.'b'The promised enforcement also has fallen short. That was evident this month aboard the Sam Simon, a 57-meter antipoaching vessel operated by the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, an environmental organization.'b'In an agreement with the Mexican Navy, Sea Shepherd has been patrolling the vaquita habitat, pulling illegal nets out of the water and spotting poachers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe see illegal activity almost every day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Oona Layolle, the leader of the Sea Shepherd campaign, called 'b'Operation Milagro'b' (Spanish for \xe2\x80\x9cmiracle\xe2\x80\x9d).'b'At about 4 p.m. one afternoon this month, a fishing boat pulled up just a few hundred meters from the Sam Simon carrying four men guided by a hand-held GPS device. One of the men dragged a hook in the water, looking for a gillnet they had hidden there.'b'The Sam Simon sent a drone over the small boat and it sped off, only to return with six men aboard, who threw objects at the drone before leaving again. Despite a call to the Mexican Navy, nobody came.'b'Even when arrests are made, conservationists say, the prosecution is too slapdash to win a conviction for a serious crime.'b'Last year, Mexican Navy patrols succeeded in scaring off the totoaba poachers by day, forcing them to haul in their nets at night. But this year, the poachers work openly during the day, some wearing balaclavas, apparently undeterred by desultory government patrols. Some poachers even post photos of their weapons on Facebook.'b'At the same time, four boats belonging to Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s environmental prosecutor are parked on a side street running above the dock here, their motors broken or simply unused because fuel is in short supply.'b'The nets tell a similar tale. Over 10 weeks last spring, Operation Milagro pulled 42 totoaba nets from these waters. In the fall, a broad government-sponsored survey succeeded in finding 36 totoaba nets, 28 of which were in use.'b'In mid-December, Operation Milgro resumed and found 56 more totoaba nets in nine weeks. Almost all were new, and some were set in the same places that the government effort had cleared just weeks earlier.'b'During night patrol aboard the Sam Simon last week, the crew pulled up yet another totoaba net of wide blue mesh, its unweathered red buoys evidence that the net was brand new.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe situation is so dramatic that we have to take huge measures,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Layolle said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a desperate time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s environment minister, Rafael Pacchiano Alam\xc3\xa1n, promised this month to send 45 federal police officers to patrol the beaches and to dismantle poachers\xe2\x80\x99 camps.'b'But he did not respond to the main recommendation of conservationists: a permanent gillnet ban. The legal fishing season for corvina has begun, which means dozens of small boats will be out on the water, giving cover to poachers.'b'Despite 'b'a promise'b' last year by President Enrique Pe\xc3\xb1a Nieto, the government has yet to act on the gillnet ban. Without that, warn conservationists, there is no way to begin to save the vaquita.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t remove the threats, the population keeps declining,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Turvey said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have time for complacency.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not long ago, many Republican officeholders had a simple answer when asked about the changing climate: What changing climate?'b'But the public began to notice the 'b'heat waves'b' and the 'b'torrential rains'b' and the 'b'tidal flooding'b'. So then we had the \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a scientist\xe2\x80\x9d phase, with one lawmaker after another fending off climate questions with that formula.'b'That drew such 'b'ridicule'b' that Republicans critical of climate science had to come up with a more nuanced answer. Several variations on the new approach were on display recently during confirmation hearings for some of President Trump\xe2\x80\x99s cabinet nominees.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cScience tells us that the climate is changing and human activity in some manner impacts that change,\xe2\x80\x9d Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma attorney general nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency, 'b'told a Senate committee'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cThe human ability to measure with precision the extent of that impact is subject to continuing debate and dialogue, as well they should be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Let us ponder the craftsmanship of that second sentence.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith precision\xe2\x80\x9d is the key phrase, of course, and it renders the statement almost axiomatically true. Do we have trouble taking the precise temperature of an entire planet and then divining, for a given period, 'b'exactly'b' how much of the change in that temperature is caused by human activities?'b'Well, yes.'b'Anybody who did not know better might come away thinking there is room to doubt whether humans are the main cause of 'b'global warming'b'. Mr. Pruitt did not actually say that, of course \xe2\x80\x94 nowadays, hard-core climate denial provokes a furious response from Democrats in Congress and mild protest even from a few Republicans.'b'Thus Mr. Pruitt and the other Trump nominees labored to avoid overt denial while signaling to their allies that there is enough doubt to justify inaction on emissions or even rolling back steps the Obama administration took.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re just trying not to look crazy, because if they look too crazy, then Susan Collins\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a Republican senator from Maine \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cand a few of the moderate Republicans might jump ship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Raymond T. Pierrehumbert, an American climate scientist who holds a chair at Oxford University, in Britain.'b'In interviews, Dr. Pierrehumbert and several other experts said the public should not be fooled. The deep consensus among climate scientists, arrived at through decades of research, is that human activity is the cause of most of the planetary warming of recent decades, and probably all of it.'b'What is the evidence?'b'For starters, an 'b'unassailable body of physics'b' tells us that if you add carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, they will trap extra heat near the surface of the planet, a prediction so basic it was first made in the 19th century.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPeople have been trying, but nobody has really shaken the foundations of the theory in all that time,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Pierrehumbert said.'b'Emissions have soared in the modern era, and as predicted, the 'b'Earth'b' is heating up. That would be obvious just from all the land ice that is melting, but of course, we have had thermometers for centuries now. They show that the Earth has warmed roughly 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century, a large number for the surface of a planet.'b'With just those facts, you have a powerful circumstantial case that human activities are the cause of global warming. But we have more: Sophisticated computer analyses of the climate confirm it, finding that no factor other than the human release of greenhouse gases is large enough to explain the recent warming.'b'What are the soft spots in the theory?'b'The biggest is that natural factors could in principle be causing the climate to change, as Mr. Pruitt implied. Suppose, for example, that the sun were to start putting out a lot more radiation; that would definitely warm the Earth.'b'But we have satellites keeping a close eye on the sun, and it has not changed nearly enough to be the culprit. Scientists have looked closely at all the possible natural factors, in fact, and they are not adequate to explain the warming.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf all the natural drivers, and everything we know that works on long time scales that has ever affected climate in the past, all those things have been ruled out,\xe2\x80\x9d said Drew Shindell, an atmospheric scientist at Duke University. \xe2\x80\x9cBeyond a reasonable doubt, it has to be human activities.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The most important uncertainties are not really about the cause of global warming \xe2\x80\x94 we are the cause \xe2\x80\x94 but in trying to forecast how big the coming changes will be.'b'If emissions continue at a high level but the Earth turns out to be less sensitive to greenhouse gases than currently believed, that would give humanity a few extra decades to come to grips with the situation. But it is not a get-out-of-jail-free card: If we keep burning fossil fuels in that time, scientists say the planet will still undergo profound, threatening changes.'b'On the other hand, if the Earth turns out to be especially sensitive to the gases and if we permit runaway emissions growth, some 'b'research'b' suggests that huge parts of the world could eventually get so hot as to be uninhabitable by large mammals.'b'Recall that the large mammals include human beings. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople tend to think of climate change as not being of the same magnitude as nuclear warfare, but at the high end, it\xe2\x80\x99s arguably worse,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Pierrehumbert said.'b'So, despite some genuine uncertainties, the risks are extraordinary, and the moral case for action is pretty clear: We have to get to zero emissions, the sooner the better. Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s nominees have so far displayed scant willingness to come to grips with that.'b'Perhaps surprisingly, though, the congressional hearings did offer glimmers of hope.'b'Rex W. Tillerson, who won confirmation on Wednesday as Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s secretary of state, implied that he might try to keep the nation committed to a big international 'b'deal'b' on climate change reached in Paris in 2015.'b'But the most interesting statements came from Rick Perry, Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s nominee to head the Department of Energy. Under questioning, Mr. Perry, the former Texas governor, was surprisingly positive about the role the federal government might play in developing advanced clean-energy technology.'b'Many people \xe2\x80\x94 Bill Gates among them \xe2\x80\x94 see this as the most urgent issue. Renewable energy and greater use of natural gas are helping lower emissions in the short run, but if we do not invest heavily in research and development now, we may not have the 'b'technology we will eventually need'b' to get to zero emissions.'b'People like Mr. Gates and the entrepreneur Elon Musk are working on Mr. Trump. If the president\xe2\x80\x99s mind is really open on global warming, as he 'b'said'b' after the election, perhaps he could also sit down with a few of our brightest climate scientists.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we always have to go back and debate the facts, we\xe2\x80\x99re never going to get to the solutions,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ken Caldeira, a California climate expert who has helped to educate Mr. Gates. \xe2\x80\x9cCan\xe2\x80\x99t we at least start with the facts and go from there?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You never know when a frog playing an electronic game will lead to an experiment on the physics of saliva.'b'But then, who even knew that frogs could play electronic games?'b'So let\xe2\x80\x99s start with that.'b'Alexis C. Noel, a Ph.D. student in mechanical engineering at 'b'Georgia Tech'b', and her supervisor, David L. Hu, were watching a viral YouTube 'b'video 'b'in which a frog is attacking the screen of a smartphone running an ant-smashing game. It appears to be winning.'b'They started wondering how \xe2\x80\x94 in reality \xe2\x80\x94 frog tongues stick to insects so quickly when they shoot out to grab them, and decided it was a phenomenon worth studying.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been an adventure ever since,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Noel said.'b'First, the whole frog tongue slap shot occurs in the blink of an eye, requiring Ms. Noel and her colleagues to shoot high-speed video of a variety of frogs at the Atlanta Botanical Garden and Zoo Atlanta.'b'Then they ran tests on the saliva itself and the frog tissue.'b'Ms. Noel fondly recalled spending hours at night in the lab scraping tongues from dissected frogs donated by a biology class at the university.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI needed about a fifth of a teaspoon of saliva,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'With data on the speed of the tongue shot and retraction, the viscosity \xe2\x80\x94 or stickiness \xe2\x80\x94 of the saliva, and the softness of the tongue tissue, they came up with a computer simulation to test their ideas of what was going on.'b'What they found was that frog saliva, which is normally 50,000 times stickier than human saliva, flows freely when it hits an insect.'b'That makes the saliva a non-Newtonian fluid, which means that the speed at which it flows (to be precise, its shear rate) changes how viscous it is.'b'In the case of frog saliva, the faster it is forced to flow, the looser it gets. When the frog tongue hits a cricket, the saliva becomes 100 times less viscous and flows around the cricket into every little crevice.'b'By the time the frog starts to pull its tongue back, in a much smoother and slower motion than the body slam attack, the saliva has gotten thick and sticky again and the tongue has wrapped all around the cricket.'b'There is one more step. The frog has to get the cricket unstuck and into its stomach. What helps here is that frog swallowing involves 'b'retracting its 'b''b' eyeballs'b' \xe2\x80\x94 so violently that it loosens up the saliva again.'b'The researchers published their findings in 'b'Royal Society Interface'b'. Dr. Hu said the detailed understanding of how the process worked had obvious applications for the growing field of soft robots made of very flexible materials.'b'Not that they will have tongues, but they may need to grab and release \xe2\x80\x94 who knows what \xe2\x80\x94 with appendages more like tongues than metal claws.'b'Ms. Noel said her research was \xe2\x80\x9call about how you grab things with very soft surfaces.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She is also studying 'b'cat tongues'b', for instance. They are covered in tiny little curved spikes, like claws, which, oddly enough, are very good at detangling snarls in fur.'b'As he prepares to launch a fact-filled show into a fact-challenged world, Bill Nye, a.k.a. the Science Guy, is looking on the bright side.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be optimistic,\xe2\x80\x9d the author, engineer and television personality said in a phone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not going to solve global problems or address global issues without being optimistic.

That type of notable mission could speed up a return to the 'b'moon'b'.'b'Robert M. Lightfoot Jr., the acting NASA administrator, said the agency was studying what it would take to add a crew to the first flight of the Space Launch System, a mammoth rocket under development for deep space missions.'b'Under current plans, the first launch was scheduled for late 2018 and did not include a crew for testing the systems aboard the rocket and the capsule, named Orion.'b'That would have been followed by a gap of several years before a second flight, with astronauts, that would have taken off no earlier than 2021.'b'Mr. Lightfoot spoke at a conference for companies working on the Space Launch System and Orion programs. Boeing is the main contractor for the rocket; Lockheed Martin is building Orion. Mr. Lightfoot also sent a memo to NASA employees.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know the challenges associated with such a proposition, like reviewing the technical feasibility, additional resources needed, and clearly the extra work would require a different launch date,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Lightfoot wrote in the memo. \xe2\x80\x9cThat said, I also want to hear about the opportunities it could present to accelerate the effort of the first crewed flight and what it would take to accomplish that first step of pushing humans farther into space.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Under the current plans for the first launch, a crewless Orion capsule would spend three weeks in space, flying to the moon and entering an orbit about 40,000 miles above the surface. With astronauts on board, the mission would most likely be shorter, perhaps similar to the trajectory taken by Apollo 8 in December 1968, when three NASA astronauts made 10 orbits around the moon in 20 hours and then returned to Earth.'b'To add astronauts would require significant work and rejiggering. Because no astronauts were planned, the Orion capsule planned for the first flight currently did not contain the full working life-support system. The first Space Launch System rocket also uses an upper stage that is derived from the Delta 4 rocket that has not been rated for crewed missions. NASA is developing a more powerful upper stage for the second flight.'b'The risks of flying people on the first launch of a rocket are much greater. In the 'b'Apollo program'b', NASA launched several crewless missions to gain confidence before adding astronauts on Apollo 7. Two commercial systems by Boeing and SpaceX to take astronauts to the International Space Station will also fly crewless test flights first. The first launch of the 'b'space shuttle'b' in 1981 did carry astronauts.'b'Boeing and Lockheed Martin put out statements that supported the effort. \xe2\x80\x9cThe possibility of NASA accelerating the timeline to put humans into the vicinity of the moon and onto Mars is exciting,\xe2\x80\x9d Boeing said.'b'The Lockheed Martin statement noted some of the challenges. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll look at accelerating remaining crew system designs, as well as potential technical and schedule challenges and how to mitigate them,\xe2\x80\x9d the company said.'b'Trump administration officials have not provided much information about their plans for NASA, and no permanent administrator has yet been nominated.'b'During his inaugural speech, President Trump made a passing mention of a desire \xe2\x80\x9cto unlock the mysteries of space.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Lightfoot wrote in his memo, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom my interactions with the transition team, NASA is clearly a priority for the president and his administration.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Arthur H. Rosenfeld'b', a physicist who became widely known as the father of energy efficiency for championing energy-saving requirements for appliances and buildings, died on Friday in Berkeley, Calif. He was 90.'b'The cause was related to pneumonia, said Adam Gottlieb, a marketing and outreach specialist with the California Energy Commission, with which Dr. Rosenfeld worked for 10 years.'b'His work, embraced at first in California under Gov. Jerry Brown, gained national attention and helped lay the foundation for federal energy-efficiency rules that are in place today.'b'Dr. Rosenfeld\xe2\x80\x99s awakening to energy efficiency came in 1973, when the Arab oil embargo caused energy prices to soar and long lines to form at gas pumps. He was then 18 years into a highly regarded academic career in nuclear and particle physics at the University of California, Berkeley.'b'One Friday night in November 1973, vexed at Americans\xe2\x80\x99 tendency to waste huge amounts of energy even at the height of the crisis, Dr. Rosenfeld decided to turn out the lights in all 20 offices on his laboratory\xe2\x80\x99s floor. He had always turned off his own lights \xe2\x80\x94 a product, perhaps, of his having lived through the Great Depression. But most of his colleagues did not, even when leaving for the weekend.'b'Dr. Rosenfeld calculated the amount of oil-equivalent energy wasted, and searched behind cabinets, bookcases and posters for the switches.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter 20 minutes of uncovering light switches (and saving 100 gallons for the weekend), I decided that U.C. Berkeley and its Radiation Laboratory should do something about conservation,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in 'b'a short autobiography'b' posted on the California Energy Commission website.'b'He immediately convened academics and other experts to figure out what to do about the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy-guzzling habits. The problem was easy to diagnose, he wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cOil and gas were as cheap as dirt or water, and so they were treated like dirt or water.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Having traveled to physics laboratories abroad, Dr. Rosenfeld knew that Europeans used far less energy per unit of economic output than Americans did yet maintained similar living standards. Surely, he reasoned, the United States could cut its energy use, too.'b'In 1975, he created the Energy Efficient Buildings Program (later renamed the Center for Building Science) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and set about studying how making appliances like refrigerators and air-conditioners more efficient could cut energy use significantly and save billions of dollars. (One byproduct of the lab\xe2\x80\x99s research was the introduction of energy-efficient compact fluorescent lamps.)'b'Dr. Rosenfeld\xe2\x80\x99s ideas caught the ears of powerful people, including Governor Brown, then in his first tenure in that office. (He was elected again in 2010.) Dr. Rosenfeld shared a dinner table with Mr. Brown at a faculty club event at Berkeley in the mid-1970s, and the two discussed a proposed nuclear plant called Sundesert.'b'Dr. Rosenfeld told the governor that just by requiring refrigerators to be more energy efficient, the state could save as much electricity as the Sundesert plant would produce. The next morning, Dr. Rosenfeld got a call from a top California energy official.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe said, \xe2\x80\x98Art, I think you\xe2\x80\x99d be happy to know that Jerry Brown woke me up this morning at 8 a.m. to know if this guy Art Rosenfeld is real,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Dr. Rosenfeld recalled years later'b'. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was the unraveling of Sundesert.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Energy-efficiency requirements for refrigerators and freezers sold in California went into effect in 1977. They were soon followed by standards for other appliances. In 1987, the federal government, following California\xe2\x80\x99s lead, began imposing its own efficiency requirements for appliances.'b'California also adopted, in 1978, the first state energy-efficient building code, partly as a result of Dr. Rosenfeld\xe2\x80\x99s research. In what is sometimes called the \xe2\x80\x9cRosenfeld effect,\xe2\x80\x9d California\xe2\x80\x99s per-capita electricity use has remained relatively steady since the mid-1970s, despite the proliferation of gadgetry. The rest of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s usage, meanwhile, has climbed.'b'Arthur Rosenfeld was born on June 22, 1926, in Birmingham, Ala. His father was an agronomist who studied sugar cane. The family lived through the beginnings of the Depression in New Orleans before moving to Egypt, where his father consulted on sugar-cane growing. His parents taught him to turn off the lights when leaving a room, and they both drove small cars, according to The Los Angeles Times.'b'Dr. Rosenfeld was only 18 when he received a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in industrial physics from Virginia Polytechnic Institute. He served in the Navy in World War II, spending two years teaching radar operators in Chicago.'b'He studied physics at the University of Chicago under Enrico Fermi, the Nobel laureate who created the world\xe2\x80\x99s first controlled nuclear chain reaction under an abandoned university football stadium. He received a Ph.D. in 1954.'b'Dr. Rosenfeld\xe2\x80\x99s research in energy efficiency led to an advisory role at the Department of Energy under President Bill Clinton. He also served on the California Energy Commission from 2000 to 2010.'b'After retiring at 83, Dr. Rosenfeld traveled the country speaking about ways to cut energy use and heat in cities. He particularly endorsed the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cwhite roofs,\xe2\x80\x9d which reflect more sunlight than dark ones and thus are an easy way to save on air-conditioning costs.'b'In 2006, President George W. Bush awarded Dr. Rosenfeld the Enrico Fermi Award, one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top science honors. President Barack Obama presented him with the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 2011.'b'The year before, a group of scientists proposed a unit of measurement in his name. The \xe2\x80\x9cRosenfeld,\xe2\x80\x9d they said, should refer to annual electricity savings of three billion kilowatt-hours \xe2\x80\x94 enough to eliminate the need for a coal plant.'b'Last year, Dr. Rosenfeld received the Tang Prize, a recently established Taiwanese award sometimes referred to as Asia\xe2\x80\x99s version of the Nobel.'b'His wife of 53 years, Roselyn Bernheim Rosenfeld, known as Roz, died in 2009. Dr. Rosenfeld, who lived in Berkeley, is survived by two daughters, Dr. Margaret Rosenfeld and Dr. Anne Hansen; and six grandchildren.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cArt Rosenfeld helped make California the world leader in energy efficiency,\xe2\x80\x9d Governor Brown said in a statement on Friday. \xe2\x80\x9cHis pathbreaking ideas transformed our energy sector from one of massive waste to increasingly elegant efficiency. I will miss him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When the ancestors of 'b'Darwin\xe2\x80\x99s finches'b' arrived on the Gal\xc3\xa1pagos two million years ago, they gained access to a world of new morsels, untapped by other animals. In a relatively short period, 14 species of finches evolved, specializing in different diets through different beak shapes: short for crushing seeds, sharp for catching insects, long for probing cactus flowers and so on.'b'This rapid diversification in the presence of new opportunity is called adaptive radiation. Studies of small island bird and lizard populations describe a fast burst of evolution, followed by a slowdown. But broader research has failed to find this fast-then-slow pattern of evolution on a global scale.'b'An international team of researchers set out to investigate this seeming paradox through a particular trait: the shapes of birds\xe2\x80\x99 bills. Analyzing more than 2,000 species of birds, the researchers suggest in a report 'b'published'b' Wednesday in Nature that even though evolution does not slow down globally, the theory of adaptive radiation holds up.'b'In the case of birds, it is not that evolution slows over time, but rather it switches from generating major changes in beak shape to producing smaller iterations of the same basic shapes, said 'b'Gavin Thomas'b', a professor of animal and plant sciences at the University of Sheffield in Britain and an author of the paper.'b'In their study, Dr. Thomas and collaborators collected 3-D scans of bird beaks from museum specimens representing more than 97 percent of present-day birds. Through a website called 'b'Mark My Bird'b', they asked the public to help mark out specific features on the scans, including the tip, midline and curvature of each bill.'b'By combining these beak shape measurements with the latest DNA-based evolutionary trees, the scientists were able to infer ancestral bill shapes and rates of evolution going back more than 80 million years.'b'Their data suggested that most of the variation we see in beaks today evolved long ago, in a relatively short period of time. \xe2\x80\x9cVery early on, in the first 20 million years or so of modern bird evolutionary history, you develop a wide range of bill morphologies, with all kinds of extremes,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Thomas said.'b'After this early proliferation, the scientists believe, there was a switch to finer-tuned evolution, which can still be fast-paced. In Hawaii, a single ancestor exploded into at least 54 species of colorful songbirds called 'b'honeycreepers'b'. In Madagascar, 22 species of 'b'vanga birds'b' emerged. Catastrophes like 'b'volcanic explosions'b' possibly opened up opportunities for local evolution as well.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn these cases, we find high rates of evolution, meaning when we compare sister species, they tend to be very different from one another,\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Thomas said. But often, the different bill shapes that evolve are similar to those that already exist elsewhere in the world.'b'This explains how, even though beak forms experienced the greatest increase in variation in the early days of birds, rates of evolution stayed relatively stable through time: Isolated groups can still evolve rapidly, just without adding much that is substantially new to the range of bill shapes found around the world.'b'A remaining question is is what limits the total range of beak shapes, said 'b'Luke Harmon'b', a professor of biology at the University of Idaho who was not involved in the research. It may be that genes constrain how birds can develop, or that the niches birds could fill with different beaks are already occupied by other animals.'b'The research also shows how much can be learned about evolution by studying common anatomical features.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is one of the first studies to build on these huge trees of bird evolutionary relationships, and to lay upon them the story of this key structure, the beak,\xe2\x80\x9d said 'b'Bhart-Anjan Bhullar'b', an assistant professor of geology at Yale University who did not participate in the research.'
