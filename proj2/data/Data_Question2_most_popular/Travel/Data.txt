b'\xe2\x80\x9c'b'Paris'b' is an ocean. Explore it, and you still won\xe2\x80\x99t know its depths.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x94 Honor\xc3\xa9 de Balzac'b'The streets of the Marais are narrow enough in some places that sunlight pierces the shadowy canyons between its soaring Renaissance-era buildings for just a few hours a day. At night the lanes take on a mysterious, medieval air when streetlamps sputter to life, casting a sheen on timeworn turrets, carved doors and stone mansions.'b'Slip into a cobbled alley off the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, a main artery, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll find yourself standing where the Duke of Orleans was assassinated in 1407 by a power-hungry rival\xe2\x80\x99s henchmen. Around the corner, the magnificent 18th-century 'b'H\xc3\xb4tel de Soubise'b' palace, home to France\xe2\x80\x99s national archives, showcases the last, anguished letter written by Marie Antoinette, bidding \xe2\x80\x9cadieu\xe2\x80\x9d to her sister before heading to the guillotine.'b'Strolling amid the steep walls and angular slate roofs always transports me back to a bygone era \xe2\x80\x94 a storied past that vibrates beneath the ferment of the chic international crowds, designer boutiques, neo-bistrots, kosher delis and L.G.B.T. clubs.'b'Fifteen years ago, I was lucky enough to find a quaint apartment on a small rue in the central Marais. I\xe2\x80\x99d just moved from Washington, D.C., to be the bureau chief for a financial news agency covering the birth of Europe\xe2\x80\x99s new currency, the 'b'euro'b', which I would go on to write about for the former International Herald Tribune and The New York Times. In short order, that historic project burst into a Continentwide financial, social and political crisis, the aftershocks of which I continue to report about today.'b'As I was settling down, one thing became clear: Paris, in all of its sprawling grandeur, would take time to know. I began with fabled destinations: climbing the hill at 'b'Montmartre'b' from the 'b'Moulin Rouge'b' one weekend, then taking a picnic basket to the Luxembourg Gardens the next. I lounged at the 'b'Canal St.-Martin'b' to watch games of boules, and searched for the tombs of Balzac, Delacroix and Jim Morrison at 'b'P\xc3\xa8re-Lachaise cemetery'b'. On Friday nights, when the 'b'Louvre Museum'b' closes late, I often lingered in the hall of Dutch painters, treasuring Vermeers and Rembrandts with the rooms nearly to myself. It called to mind Balzac\xe2\x80\x99s observation of Paris: \xe2\x80\x9cThere will always be a virgin place, an unknown den, flowers, pearls, monsters, something unheard-of, forgotten.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The list of my favored haunts grew to encompass places farther afield, especially the tree-lined, elevated 'b'Promenade Plant\xc3\xa9e'b', a secret in the sky behind the Bastille that inspired the High Line in New York. The 'b'Parc Montsouris'b' offered open space with rolling green lawns and black swans gliding over a placid lake. My favorite sunny afternoon reading spot remains the'b' Tuileries gardens'b', perched under a square-cut chestnut tree in what would be the shadow of the palace of the same name had it not been burned to the ground in 1871. This was Marie Antoinette\xe2\x80\x99s luxe prison after she and King Louis XVI were forced to leave Versailles.'b'Yet it was my own Marais neighborhood, with its footnotes from antiquity on every corner, that drew me in like no other place.'b'I got hooked on reading historic markers planted on walls and streets. They signal, for instance, the site of a 13th-century fortress that was once the 'b'European headquarters of the Knights Templar,'b' who built up the Marais. Near my home, the streets are named for medieval monastic orders, including the Guillemites and the Blancs-Manteaux, who bought land from the Templars and fortified the area. Behind the St. Paul church, signposts mark the remains of 'b'city walls'b' that King Philippe Auguste ordered in 1190 to protect Paris from invaders.'b'These days, whenever I return from a reporting trip, I head out for one of the historic Marais walks that I\xe2\x80\x99ve carved out over the years. I might start near the 'b'Square du Temple'b', a sweet, verdant park where the Templar\xe2\x80\x99s fortress stood, and where Marie Antoinette and the king were later imprisoned after trying to escape from the Tuileries. Then I amble down to the Seine toward the 'b'two islands'b' on which Paris was founded, \xc3\x8ele St.-Louis and \xc3\x8ele de la Cit\xc3\xa9, where the stone towers of'b' Notre-Dame'b' stand witness to centuries of Paris\xe2\x80\x99s turbulent, sublime history.'b'Strolling at leisure can be a challenge, if not a chore, since the Marais is often packed with visitors. An explosion of designer boutiques here has accelerated, turning the area into a sumptuous outdoor shopping and art mecca that draws thousands on weekends to the pastime of \xe2\x80\x9cl\xc3\xa8che-vitrine\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cwindow licking\xe2\x80\x9d to the French.'b'Pedestrians jam the Rue Vieille du Temple, a main drag that once led to the Templar fortress, to ogle handbags in two Chanel pop-up stores that opened in a 17th-century mansion, the 'b'H\xc3\xb4tel Amelot de Bisseuil'b'. At the entrance, ancient wood doors carved with Medusa masks have been updated with cherry-red lacquer. Rainbow-hued shoe and watch shops jostle with chocolatiers and boutiques offering $120 perfumed candles. Farther north, the Haut Marais is honeycombed with galleries, from the hip-hop displays at the 'b'Galerie Perrotin'b' to the open space of the 'b'Galerie Thaddaeus Ropac'b'.'b'While the makeover of the Marais has drawn big business, the change hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been lost on its residents. Butchers, bakers and tailors have been replaced almost entirely by chain boutiques. Near the 'b' Rue des Rosiers'b', the gentrified Jewish district where boutiques are overtaking Judaica shops and delis, an Izod Lacoste store stands in a former boulangerie: The buzz was that the company offered 'b'madame'b', the owner, a sum that allowed her to retire immediately.'b'The Marais is hardly the only area of Paris facing change. Today, the city is in the midst of an ambitious expansion project called'b' Le Grand Paris'b', which aims to enlarge Paris\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries by stitching its core to the banlieues \xe2\x80\x94 the neglected outer suburbs \xe2\x80\x94 with a new transport system. Major roads, including parts of the Rue de Rivoli, the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s main thoroughfare, may eventually 'b'close to traffic'b' to make the center pedestrian and environmentally friendly. Pioneering architecture, like the glass canopy at 'b'Les Halles'b' and the bubble curves of the 'b'Fondation Louis Vuitton'b', keeps transforming the cityscape.'b'For the Marais, the crowds testify to a rebirth. The first Golden Age came in the early 17th century, nearly 500 years after the Templars cleared vast marshland \xe2\x80\x94 or marais, in French \xe2\x80\x94 to enlarge their domain. When King Henry IV set up at what is now the 'b'Place des Vosges'b' in 1604, the aristocracy followed, building the sumptuous mansions that imbue the area with glamour today. After the French court later moved to the Tuileries Palace, the Marais deteriorated for nearly two centuries and was almost razed until the government protected it in 1964.'b'It is these traces of history that I follow on my walks, dipping in and out of the quarter\xe2\x80\x99s ancient charms, perhaps pausing for a glass of wine, handcrafted tea or a raspberry meringue at a clutch of mod cafes and p\xc3\xa2tisseries that have followed the retail influx.'b'Spring is my favorite season, when the pocket gardens are in bloom and lilacs perfume the air. Three years ago, I introduced my new love, now my husband, to a hidden oasis off the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois at the H\xc3\xb4tel de Soubise, where Marie Antoinette\xe2\x80\x99s letter lives with documents dating from the fifth-century Merovingian dynasty, France\xe2\x80\x99s ancient founders. Most people stop in the imposing stone-paved courtyard just to see the mansion. But advance to the colonnaded porch, and a path to the right opens onto 'b'four manicured French gardens'b', gilded with pines, laurels, hydrangeas and Japanese anemones. Hand in hand, we savored birdsong and breathed in the open sky from a bench tucked among the trees and roses. The city bustle beyond the walls seemed far away.'b'Braving the weekend crowds, we pick up our walk on the Rue des Francs-Bourgeois (closed to traffic on Sunday afternoons) past the spot at No. 38 where the Duke of Orleans was knocked off, igniting a civil war. The spangled boutiques inhabit a phalanx of regal h\xc3\xb4tels particuliers where Renaissance aristocrats held salons. Passing them is to breathe the air drawn by Racine, Moli\xc3\xa8re and La Fontaine.'b'At the intersection of the Rue Pav\xc3\xa9e, an unusual square turret stops people in their tracks. It\xe2\x80\x99s part of the 'b'H\xc3\xb4tel de Lamoignon'b', one of the oldest mansions in Paris, which played host to French luminaries until it was converted to a prison during the Revolution. At the entrance, a marker recounts the sordid fate of one of its inhabitants, the Princess de Lamballe, a confidante of Marie Antoinette who was set upon there by a mob.'b'After the Revolution, Marais 'b'h\xc3\xb4tels 'b'like this one were transformed into workshops and factories, the shells of which are now largely occupied by retailers hawking skinny jeans. I sometimes work on my laptop in the backside of the mansion (closed temporarily for renovation), which houses the 'b'Biblioth\xc3\xa8que Historique de la Ville de Paris'b', a light-bathed hall filled with old manuscripts, maps and books.'b'My husband and I sometimes stop for brunch nearby at 'b'Le Loir dans La Th\xc3\xa9i\xc3\xa8re'b', a Mad Hatter-themed cafe that serves quiches and desserts, including a lemon pie with a teetering meringue. Another favorite is 'b'Benedict'b' on the Rue Ste. Croix de la Bretonnerie, a Scandinavian-design brunch bistrot. 'b'Art\xc3\xa9fact'b' on the Rue des Blancs-Manteaux offers hand-brewed coffee and mixed teas in an airy setting with minimalist art.'b'On the same street, we plunge back into the past by stepping into the \xc3\x89glise des Blancs Manteaux, originally a 13th-century monastery for Augustine monks built on land owned by the Templars. (The Duke of Orleans\xe2\x80\x99s body was brought here straight after the murder.) Then we navigate the Rue Vieille du Temple and cross the Rue de Rivoli to the winding Rue des Barres. Stepping onto the 13th-century cobbles \xe2\x80\x94 once a pathway for the Templars to the Seine \xe2\x80\x94 leads you to a rare medieval timbered house leaning into the lane toward the \xc3\x89glise St.-Gervais, a Gothic behemoth atop an original seventh-century church. At the front of the church, an elm stands where an ancient one once stood, under which medieval judges mediated disputes.'b'Advancing to the 'b'Pont Louis-Philippe'b' rewards us with a panoramic view of Notre-Dame soaring above the tip of the \xc3\x8ele St.-Louis, where Parisians picnic and Chinese newlyweds have their photos snapped.'b'Even near Notre-Dame, you can escape the crowds by deviating onto the narrow Rue de la Colombe, so named for a 'b'legend about two amorous doves'b' that nested there in the Middle Ages. A tiny wine bar, La 'b'R\xc3\xa9serve de Quasimodo'b' \xe2\x80\x94 good for cheese and p\xc3\xa2t\xc3\xa9s \xe2\x80\x94 abuts a 13th-century house (dated by archaeologists who tested DNA from a cat skeleton found in the ceiling), while the glassed-in front offers a stunning view of the 'b'H\xc3\xb4tel de Ville'b'.'b'After a day\xe2\x80\x99s stroll, my husband and I often circle back to the Square du Temple in the Haut Marais for dinner, where inventive n\xc3\xa9o-bistrots flourish beside the 'b'Carreau du Temple'b'. A former covered market near the Templars\xe2\x80\x99 ancient enclosure, it was recast with a soaring glass roof into a light-filled communal hall with concerts and a recording studio.'b'On the Rue Dupetit-Thouars, 'b'M\xc3\xa1ncora Cebicheria 'b'serves exuberantly marinated Peruvian ceviche in pools of kiwi or lime, flecked with vivid dashes of beet pur\xc3\xa9e and perfumed violets. Go early: The small, whitewashed dining room is filled by 7:30 p.m., a shockingly early dinner date for trendy Parisians.'b'Down the street,'b' Les Chouettes'b' is a three-story French gastro pub with a glass ceiling and interior modeled on the Eiffel Tower\xe2\x80\x99s iron architecture. A winding staircase leads to an Old World bar with leather chairs and a small library.'b'We step back out into the night. The Square du Temple is quiet under lock and key. A streetlamp casts a pale light over the tops of trees and illuminates a sign describing how the Knights Templar occupied a premier position of power, only to fall in the unrelenting tide of history. It is a reminder to visitors that no matter how avant-garde Paris gets, they will always be walking in the shadow of its fraught and glorious past.'b'The coral wall rose from the depths of the Red Sea, a vast and multicolor canvas brimming with sea life. I swam alongside it for 200 feet, past tangled branches, swaying ferns and brain-like spheres, and then dove toward the ocean floor. A school of black-and-yellow-stripe angelfish darted around me, while a grouper the size of a Smart car lumbered past. Rising toward the surface, I spotted a silver barracuda hovering just below the water line. Abruptly the wall ended, and I rounded the corner to confront a netherworld of rusting cables, ropes, labyrinthine corridors and cabins, and a barnacle-covered anchor.'b'The dive site I had been exploring for an hour was no natural formation, but the side of an Ethiopian battleship. For the past quarter-century, this corroding wreck has lain on the bottom of the harbor of Massawa, Eritrea\xe2\x80\x99s main port city, slowly colonized by marine life. (The barracuda, my boat captain told me, was one of seven that frequent the sunken ship.) Rebels of the Eritrean People\xe2\x80\x99s Liberation Front bombarded and sank the vessel in 1990, during the last bloody months of Eritrea\xe2\x80\x99s three-decade-long 'b'independence war'b' against Ethiopia. The rusting bow and the remnants of its gunwales protrude above the surface, forming a beacon for divers and snorkelers.'b'Diving holidays are perhaps not the first thing that comes to mind when the subject of Eritrea arises. This impoverished nation in the Horn of Africa \xe2\x80\x94 bordered by Ethiopia, Djibouti, Sudan and the Red Sea \xe2\x80\x94 was once considered among the continent\xe2\x80\x99s brightest hopes. But after two decades of repression, international isolation and a forced 'b'military conscription program'b' that has driven hundreds of thousands of young people out of the country, it has earned a reputation as the \xe2\x80\x9cNorth Korea of Africa.\xe2\x80\x9d In 2016, a United Nations report accused Eritrea of \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes against humanity,\xe2\x80\x9d citing the imprisonment and torture of dissidents. Its leaders have been sanctioned by the United Nations for providing aid to Al Shabaab, the Islamic terrorist group in Somalia. (The United Nations Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea 'b'reported'b' in 2012 that the government, under international pressure, had ended its direct support of the group.) Visitors have been few and far between. According to the government guides I spoke to, the country received fewer than 1,000 tourists in 2015.'b'Yet despite its myriad problems, Eritrea is generally safe, though it\xe2\x80\x99s best to check the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s travel website for updated information on travel and security (see below). Its Red Sea coast offers some of the finest snorkeling and scuba diving in the world. The warm waters of the Dahlak Archipelago \xe2\x80\x94 a scattering of more than 120 islands, only four of them inhabited, lying just north of Massawa \xe2\x80\x94 abound with jellyfish, barracuda, manta rays, parrotfish, red snappers, coral fish, puffer fish, clown fish and more than 200 types of corals. Moreover, unlike the deeper, cooler waters elsewhere in the Red Sea, Eritrea\xe2\x80\x99s shallow, and therefore hotter, waters have created corals capable of adapting to temperature extremes. This unique environment, 'b'marine biologists believe'b', could provide a living laboratory to help endangered coral reefs around the world survive in the face of global warming.'b'I first visited Massawa in 1993, just after Eritrea formally declared its independence, as Africa bureau chief for Newsweek, then returned three years later, when the media and Western donors were still touting the country as a success story. I hired a dive boat and a guide and for two days explored the pristine reefs of the Dahlak Archipelago, then just beginning to attract tourists.'b'Two decades later, on a return visit last July, I again ventured to the coast, curious to see how Massawa had fared under Eritrea\xe2\x80\x99s harsh dictatorship, and what was left of the diving industry that, in the 1990s, had seemed poised to grow.'b'I started my journey in Asmara, the 7,628-foot-high capital, a charming, faded city filled with crumbling Art Deco movie theaters and cappuccino bars that date to Italy\xe2\x80\x99s 50-year colonization of Eritrea. ('b'The British threw out the Italians in 1941.'b') A permit is needed to visit Massawa, obtainable at a hole-in-the-wall office on Harnet Avenue, Asmara\xe2\x80\x99s main drag. There, I met a guide named Thomas, who was trying to secure permission for a dozen Chinese road engineers.'b'As we waited for the office to open, he lamented Eritrea\xe2\x80\x99s ravaged economy and the open-ended conscription program. \xe2\x80\x9cThe prime years of people\xe2\x80\x99s lives are being lost,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. He had used his connections to secure a dead-end posting in a ministry instead of army service, but still dreamed of fleeing. \xe2\x80\x9cI think about escaping, every day, but now I realize I missed my chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, as an official showed up on his moped two hours late and unlocked the door. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too late. The walls have gone up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I hired a taxi at a downtown stand, and at 8:30 the next morning, the driver, Zaki, picked me up at my hotel. It was Eid al-Fitr, marking the end of Ramadan, and the streets of this small city were deserted. We drove past the Ethiopian war cemetery, fields of cactus and a herd of camels, and then the Asmara escarpment came into view: a barrier of acacia-speckled mountains that extends almost to the Red Sea. Cyclists clad in red-and-white Lycra worked their way around the hairpin turns; the pop music of Mahmoud Ahmed, an Amharic singer from Ethiopia, blared from Zaki\xe2\x80\x99s CD player. After two hours \xe2\x80\x94 and a drop of nearly 8,000 feet \xe2\x80\x94 we reached the sandy coastal plain. A quintet of captured Ethiopian tanks marked the entrance to Massawa.'b'We crossed a causeway and arrived at the 'b'Dahlak Hotel,'b' an Italian-owned colossus that decades ago was considered Massawa\xe2\x80\x99s finest. Now it was deserted. The marble-tile staircases, Ottoman-style doorways and palatial salons hinted at the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s 1970s-era grandeur. But my $88-a-night second-floor room \xe2\x80\x94 overlooking the bombed-out seaside palace of the Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie \xe2\x80\x94 had corroding fixtures, a sagging mattress and a broken toilet seat. Entering the saltwater pool, I slipped on the thick layers of algae that covered the steps and nearly lacerated my feet kicking off the barnacle-encrusted wall. The pool floor was a moonscape of ripped up tiles and exposed mud underneath.'b'Late that afternoon the hotel clerk put me in touch with Abdullah, a grizzled boat captain who spoke some Italian but no English. A friendly English-speaking Eritrean from Asmara who was sitting at the outdoor cafe offered to help me make the deal. The logistics, I quickly learned, had grown complicated. Dahlak Kebir Island, the archipelago\xe2\x80\x99s main attraction, was now off limits to tourists, Abdullah said. Instead he proposed a daylong scuba-diving trip to Dessie Island, not far from Dahlak, for 16,000 nakfas, or $1,020, about five times what I had paid two decades earlier.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have no business,\xe2\x80\x9d Abdullah explained, pointing to five scuttled dive boats moored across Massawa harbor that had constituted his fleet during better times. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything is gone.\xe2\x80\x9d Abdullah was open to negotiation, but instead I opted for a half-day snorkeling and beach trip around Green Island, just beyond the harbor. The cost was a far more reasonable $200.'b'The next morning, with the temperature pushing 95 degrees, I met Abdullah on the dock. Two Eritreans to whom I had been introduced the day before \xe2\x80\x94 Lydia, my taxi driver Zaki\xe2\x80\x99s sister, and her boyfriend, Berhane, a Massawa-born \xc3\xa9migr\xc3\xa9 living in Norway who returns home several times a year \xe2\x80\x94 joined me for the adventure. They had packed an ice chest with cold Asmara beers, which we loaded onto the skiff.'b'As we puttered past the loading docks and cranes of the silent port, Berhane added his voice to the many others I had heard lamenting the country\xe2\x80\x99s collapse. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no enterprises and no construction. The government makes it impossible for you, so what else can you do but leave?\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. Ten of his 12 siblings had fled abroad. \xe2\x80\x9cFor many, drowning in the sea is a better option them staying here.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet Massawa was his home, he said, and Lydia lived here with her two young sons \xe2\x80\x94 and so he felt obliged to return.'b'Ten minutes after leaving the pier, Abdullah cast the anchor overboard. I strapped on my mask, snorkel and fins, and leapt off the boat. Instantly the harsh realities of Eritrea dissolved in a swirl of color and motion. The water was warm and clear, and I hovered above an extensive coral garden \xe2\x80\x94 a \xe2\x80\x9cFinding Nemo\xe2\x80\x9d tableau. Long-beaked parrotfish, big-eyed squirrelfish, translucent blue disc-shaped surgeonfish, and huge angelfish in a dozen patterns nibbled on brightly colored coral and darted through sea anemones. Schools of tetras and black mollies swept past. I chased a blue-spotted stingray, keeping a safe distance, until it darted beneath a rock, only its poisonous spine protruding from its sanctuary. After an hour spent exploring several of these coral gardens, I climbed back aboard the boat, and we headed toward Green Island. The Asmara escarpment \xe2\x80\x94 barren and dun colored \xe2\x80\x94 rose just beyond the shore. I walked along a beach alive with hermit crabs. The entire beach seemed to be in motion, tiny white conch shells skittering across the sand.'b'At dusk that evening I walked by myself down a causeway into Massawa\xe2\x80\x99s Old City. I had been here 20 years before, and remembered jostling with crowds in a square filled with fish restaurants and outdoor tables. Now, wandering down deserted alleys, past mosques and crumbling archways, I searched in vain for the square. Two young couples sat on stools in the dirt courtyard of a private home. One of the women, who spoke some English, invited me to join them. I asked where all the people had gone. \xe2\x80\x9cThey have all left \xe2\x80\x94 for Europe,\xe2\x80\x9d she replied. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to go, too?\xe2\x80\x9d I asked. \xe2\x80\x9cThe boys do, because they are both in the army, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'She directed me to one of a handful of restaurants still open: 'b'Salam,'b' on a dirt square opposite a liquor shop that was illuminated by a string of orange lights for Eid al-Fitr. Two Eritrean diaspora families visiting from the United States \xe2\x80\x94 20 in each group \xe2\x80\x94 sat at tables in front.'b'I ordered the sea bass, and it came quickly to my table, butterflied and grilled with paprika, served with flaky and charred flat bread. It was crisp, spicy and utterly delicious. I paid the bill and walked through the now-darkened streets, past splashes of light from a couple of grocery stores. Then I reached the causeway, and followed a set of abandoned railway tracks back to the Dahlak Hotel.'b''b'For more information about traveling to Eritrea, go to 'b'lonelyplanet.com/eritrea'b'.

The crowds have swarmed here since the restaurant opened in June, initially thanks to its pedigree: The French-trained chef Chris Ponte, one of five owners, is celebrated over in Clearwater for 'b'Cafe Ponte'b', his fine-dining restaurant, while three fellow owners have long histories as executives with Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill. With On Swann, the team has created a casual, vintage-chic American bistro with winning dishes and, despite our initial impression, superior service and a spirited atmosphere.'b'Indeed, five minutes after our arrival, our fortunes reversed. We were seated near a wall of floor-to-ceiling doors opening onto a patio, delivering a tropical breeze and a sound filter.

We skipped the popular cheese and charcuterie boards and did our own thing. Standouts included a fig tart with caramelized onions, Gorgonzola and prosciutto on a perfectly charred crust; a rich short rib pasta dish; and a thick and juicy pork chop with creamy grits. A custom veggie mix readily whipped up for our vegan was fine.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe wanted to keep the food simple and marketable to our clients, a place in the neighborhood they\xe2\x80\x99d come to once a week,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Ponte said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut also celebratory, where we create special moments.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Trudy Cooper, an owner (and an Outback founder), said she and her husband first traveled with Mr. Ponte and his wife to see how the couples would get along and to scope out food destinations around the country.'b'When asked how it felt to be free of the corporate kangaroo on their backs, Ms. Cooper said it reminded her of the early days of Outback, in the late 1980s. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen we started, it was just to open a few restaurants in the area,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe probably have interest in stepping out a little further, but we\xe2\x80\x99re not looking to build another empire.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Attention, procrastinators: It\xe2\x80\x99s still not too late to book a spring break trip.

For the same dates, the lowest round-trip fare on United was $286.'b'Every March, the 'b'South by Southwest'b' (SXSW) festival (this year, March 10 to 19) draws an affluent crowd of techies, celebrity artists and their fans to this popular city for music, movies and conferences. The time to visit is when they all go home. Hotel rates drop precipitously, while the average daytime temperatures remain in the 60s and 70s.'b'In a recent search on 'b'Expedia.com,'b' the lowest rate for a four-star hotel the week of SXSW was $834 a night at the Hyatt Regency Austin. A week later the same hotel was available for $299 a night. You can eat well and cheaply at the myriad food trucks found in every nook of the city that serve everything from cupcakes to Korean barbecue. Take in the bluebonnets and other spring wildflowers at 'b'Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center'b', kayak Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin or visit the 'b'rodeo'b' (March 11'b''b'to 25), where aspiring young cowgirls and cowboys ride sheep in the mutton bustin\xe2\x80\x99 competition, among other classic rodeo games. For a thrill at dusk, head to the Congress Avenue Bridge to witness hundreds of thousands of bats emerge from underneath as they set off on their nightly bug hunt.'b'While spring is a prime time to visit this desert town, with daytime temperatures in the mid-80s and a retro pool party scene, hotels and rentals are plentiful. In the last year, roughly a dozen hotels have opened up or undergone face-lifts, including the 32-room 'b'Arrive Hotel'b', with a pool, hot tub, bocce court and ice cream parlor/gift shop, and rates from $209 a night (based on a recent search).'b'And on Feb. 15, an 'b'ordinance'b' designed to limit the number of vacation rentals was overturned, making way for a surge in listings. 'b'Villaway.com'b', a luxury rental site, will be adding more than 50 homes in the area to its site over the next few weeks. There are \xe2\x80\x9camazing deals in Palm Springs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Joe Liebke, the chief executive of Villaway, noting that a five-bedroom villa with a guesthouse, pool and private disco perched on a bluff is available for $1,200 a night in March, down from $2,000. In March, he said, visitors will beat the \xe2\x80\x9cmadness of crowds\xe2\x80\x9d that arrive for the 'b'Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival'b' in mid-April. .'b'Families will appreciate the sunshine, beautiful beaches and kid-oriented attractions, including the 'b'San Diego Zoo and Safari Park'b', 'b'SeaWorld San Diego'b' and 'b'Legoland California'b'. Four hotels have opened in or near downtown in the last year, including the Pendry \xe2\x80\x94 the debut of a new luxury brand from Montage International \xe2\x80\x94 in the Gaslamp Quarter. 'b'It'b' has 317 rooms, a spa and three restaurants and bars, including a poolside rooftop lounge.

Whistler Blackcomb is the largest ski area in North America with more than 200 trails across some 8,100 acres and terrain for beginners, intermediates and experts. Blackcomb Mountain gets snow late into the spring, remaining open until May 22, more than a month later than most resorts in North America. Through April, Ski.com is offering 20 to 40 percent off hotels and condos like Crystal Lodge &amp; Suites, in the center of Whistler Village, and Le Chamois, at the base of Blackcomb Mountain in the Upper Village, steps from the chairlifts.'b'Airfares to Europe are down nearly 20 percent on average for travel in March compared with the same period last year, according to 'b'StudentUniverse'b', a booking site for students and recent graduates, which found round-trip flights as low as $301 from New York to Stockholm, $332 from Boston to Copenhagen and $352 from New York to Barcelona or Madrid in a recent search. And the strong dollar means more buying power when you land.'b'Low fares can also be found on European budget carriers like 'b'Norwegian Air'b' and 'b'Wow Air'b', which have been expanding in the United States. Monograms is offering package tours between 'b'10 and 20 percent off'b' with rates from $1,295 a person for a week of sightseeing in Rome and Venice.'b'Airbnb, the peer-to-peer accommodations site where travelers book everything from single rooms to entire villas, has spent the last couple of years branching out. It has teamed up with airlines like 'b'Delta'b' and 'b'Virgin America'b' to give miles to travelers who book stays. And it has teamed up with travel management companies including 'b'American Express Global Business Travel'b' on its 'b'Airbnb for Business'b' program, which includes homes with business essentials such as Wi-Fi and laptop-friendly work spaces.'b'Now, the company has unveiled its most ambitious endeavor yet \xe2\x80\x94 'b'Trips'b' \xe2\x80\x94 designed to help travelers not only book accommodations, but also book activities like cooking and painting lessons; take audio walking tours; and attend meetups. Soon users will be able to make restaurant reservations through the Airbnb app. And the company says car rentals, grocery deliveries and even flights are in the works, further propelling Airbnb toward being a full-fledged travel company.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is literally just the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d Brian Chesky, Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, said in November at the Airbnb Open in Los Angeles, where the company\xe2\x80\x99s leaders discussed what\xe2\x80\x99s in the pipeline. So far, Trips has experiences available in a dozen cities worldwide: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Detroit, Havana, London, Paris, Florence, Nairobi, Cape Town, Tokyo and Seoul. Mr. Chesky said that it would expand to more than 50 cities next year.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrips is an immense program of both vertical and horizontal expansion of Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s business model,\xe2\x80\x9d said Bjorn Hanson, a clinical professor with the New York University School of Professional Studies at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism. Indeed, the revenue from the new Trips businesses could exceed Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s core business revenue in just a few years, he said in an email. It ultimately could put Airbnb in the same class as major trip-booking sites like Expedia.'b'Yet Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s expansion over the last eight years has not been without controversy. Travelers have experienced 'b'discrimination by Airbnb hosts'b', leading the company to create a new 'b'nondiscrimination policy'b'. In New York, politicians and tenants\xe2\x80\x99 rights groups said that Airbnb 'b'worsened affordable housing'b' problems. In San Francisco, Airbnb was fined for processing illegal listings. Even as Airbnb is working to fix these and other issues, it is pushing forward.'b'Trips includes three categories (for now), which appear at the top of the Airbnb 'b'app'b': Experiences (activities such as following a member of the Tuscan Truffle Hunters Association through a forest in Italy, or motorcycling from Nairobi to Lake Naivasha with a biker); Places (online local guides for, say, finding authentic tacos and scenic trails; audio walking tours; and meetups); and Homes (Airbnb offers about three million rentals). In the future, it plans to add additional categories such as flights, though exactly what that might include remains to be seen.'b'What awaits you in Trips? Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look.'b''b'EXPERIENCES'b' While researching flights and hotels online has become second nature, few companies have managed to offer a worldwide variety of local experiences and make them easy and attractive to browse. Few sites offer consistency when it comes to particulars like photos, clutter-free pages and reviews. And not all sites offer the chance to communicate with a guide in advance.'b'Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cExperiences,\xe2\x80\x9d which you can browse in thumbnails that call to mind old movie posters, are clear and fleshed out and allow travelers to post reviews and contact hosts in advance. Experiences vary in length and cost, such as \xe2\x80\x9cBiking Hidden Tokyo,\xe2\x80\x9d a three-day cycling tour (with stops for meals) for $301, or \xe2\x80\x9cBubbly With a View,\xe2\x80\x9d a four-hour wine estate tour and tasting of Methode Cap Classique, a South African style of wine, in the Franschhoek wine valley for $73. Half the experiences offered on Airbnb are below $200, Mr. Chesky said.'b'Airbnb divides experiences into multiday \xe2\x80\x9cimmersions\xe2\x80\x9d or single experiences (just a few hours). You can filter by interest, such as \xe2\x80\x9cfood &amp; drink,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chistory,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnature,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwellness,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfashion,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csports,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9carts\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csocial impact,\xe2\x80\x9d which are experiences offered for the benefit of nonprofit organizations like the 'b'Nelson Mandela Foundation'b' and 'b'Facing Change: Documenting Detroit'b'.'b'Beginning last month, would-be hosts in the dozen cities mentioned above, as well as in nearly 40 more \xe2\x80\x94 including Berlin, Cartagena, Chicago, Dubai, New Delhi, Reykjavik, Singapore, Tel Aviv and Toronto \xe2\x80\x94 could begin asking to list their experiences with Airbnb.'b'An experience purchased through the site can be canceled within 24 hours of booking for a full refund. If you cancel 30 days or more before the experience, you are also eligible for a full refund. If, however, you cancel less than 30 days before the start date, you won\xe2\x80\x99t receive a refund, unless the spot is booked and the experience completed by another guest. More details are at 'b'Airbnb.com/experiences/cancellation-policy'b'.'b'Airbnb has also introduced a new identity authentication process for those offering and booking experiences. They have to scan an official government ID (like a passport) and then take a selfie in real time (which must match the ID photo). While meant to help protect users, these and other security measures raise privacy concerns. For instance, the site stores your government ID photo, and information you provide to Airbnb is shared with third-party partners. To help make an informed decision about whether you want to participate, check out the site\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c'b'help'b'\xe2\x80\x9d section for details.'b''b'PLACES'b' The \xe2\x80\x9cPlaces\xe2\x80\x9d category focuses on sightseeing. This includes free themed guides written by local influencers about their own cities. A pianist in Havana, for instance, writes about where to hear live music like salsa and jazz. A booking agent in California writes about the Los Angeles rock scene. So far, there are 100 such guides in six cities: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Havana, Nairobi, Detroit and Seoul.'b'In addition to guides, Places also offers audio walking tours. Airbnb partnered with 'b'Detour'b', which creates GPS tours of cities. Right now the tours are available only in certain areas of downtown Los Angeles and can be downloaded free. In the spring of 2017, additional city tours will include San Francisco, Paris, London, Tokyo and Seoul.'b'Under \xe2\x80\x9cPlaces,\xe2\x80\x9d users may also find Meetups \xe2\x80\x94 free get-togethers for Airbnb users hosted by local businesses. A feature called Nearby Now offers tips and advice for places around you, like restaurants. For those on the go, a partnership with a restaurant booking platform called 'b'Resy'b' will soon allow travelers to book tables at such restaurants through the Airbnb app. Resy said the feature will be available in early 2017.'b''b'HOMES'b' The \xe2\x80\x9cHomes\xe2\x80\x9d tab includes Airbnb\xe2\x80\x99s rentals. In the future, users will be able to use the \xe2\x80\x9cHomes\xe2\x80\x9d tab to have groceries delivered to their Airbnb. They will also be able to book rental cars.'b'Need to book a hotel on the go, or a friendly dinner recommendation while exploring a new city? There\xe2\x80\x99s a bot for that.'b'In fact, there are now chatbots for all kinds of things, from 'b'weather updates'b' to 'b'health advice,'b' as the popularity of smartphone messaging apps driven by artificial intelligence grows.'b'Mobile messaging apps were used by 1.6 billion people in 2016, and will reach two billion in 2018, or 80 percent of all smartphone users, 'b'according to the digital data researcher eMarketer'b'.'b'Another sign of their growing influence was evident last April, when 'b'Facebook announced it was opening its Messenger app'b' to any outside company that wants to integrate its own bots into the chat program.'b'Now, the booking services Expedia, Kayak, Skyscanner and many others are allowing potential customers to seek recommendations on hotel rooms and flights and book them via Facebook Messenger.'b'Several other travel-related bots have sprung up in recent months, providing services like bookings and tips for activities, with a robotic touch.'b'The technology is young, and while most of these chatbots have yet to become viable alternatives to existing travel planning options like Trip Advisor and traditional guides, it could be only a matter of time before our smartphone-obsessed culture embraces booking by text.'b'Here is what three of the more interesting options have to offer so far:'b''b'SnapTravel'b' aims to find you a hotel based on your budget and preferences via SMS, Facebook Messenger or Slack. It uses a combination of artificial and human intelligence to search Expedia, Priceline and more than 100 other sites for the best deal, and claims to have \xe2\x80\x9csecret deals\xe2\x80\x9d of its own.'b'The bot first asks for your travel city and dates, whether you have a specific hotel brand in mind and if you have any neighborhood preferences in the city.'b'I texted SnapTravel while I was looking to book a few nights in my hometown, Binghamton, N.Y., during Thanksgiving week. Based on my initial responses, SnapTravel gave me a cost estimate for three- and four-star hotels in the area.'b'After another series of questions regarding my budget, brand preference and more, I was told to hang tight and it would get back to me with hotel options within an hour.'b'Seven minutes later, I was sent what it deemed my four best options, with photos and links to more details and booking options for each hotel, a link to a map with more options, and I was asked if I wanted to be put in touch with one of its travel agents (who can offer some human insight).'b'The entire process from start to finish took 16 minutes. But it felt more like an automated phone call with a cable company than a typical text conversation. I thanked the bot, and was pleased that it did not bug me later on, something I had expected.'b'The hotel recommendations were a mixed bag. I told the bot that I prefer Marriott hotels, and it included a Courtyard Marriott within my budget. The other three included a bed-and-breakfast, a local resort and a Homewood Suites by Hilton. Points for variety, but another Marriott choice would have been nice. Meanwhile the map with more options had only two additional hotels.'b'As far as the deals themselves, they seemed legitimate when compared with the prices seen on discount booking websites like 'b'Hotwire.com'b'. When you click on the hotel\xe2\x80\x99s link on SnapTravel, you get its rates, are told whether there is a cancellation fee and are given the opportunity to compare its rate for that hotel with other booking sites.'b'While you won\xe2\x80\x99t get a comprehensive list to shop from, SnapTravel mostly did what it claims it can do, and in a timely manner.'b'A spinoff from the Hipmunk booking website and smartphone app, 'b'Hello Hipmunk'b' offers up a cute chipmunk to help you book travel from Facebook Messenger, Slack or Skype.'b'Just be careful what you ask for. You will need to be specific if you want to get relevant results.'b'I used Messenger to converse with Hipmunk, and before I had a chance to say hello, the critter asked me what airport I usually fly from. I said La Guardia, assuming it would understand that I meant La Guardia Airport in New York City. But it came back with: \xe2\x80\x9cLooks like you\xe2\x80\x99re planning a getaway from Laguardia, Spain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I tried again, asking for some flight deals from New York to Chicago for the next week. He came back with: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re looking for the best time to go from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL. Hold on, I\xe2\x80\x99m digging through the data now. :)\xe2\x80\x9d Not really there, but we\xe2\x80\x99re getting closer, and I appreciate the service with a smile.'b'Next I tried: \xe2\x80\x9cI need a flight from New York to Chicago, leaving tomorrow and coming back on October 9.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That seemed to do it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cReady to jet? I\xe2\x80\x99m finding you flights from New York City, NY, to Chicago, IL, on October 05, coming back on October 09,\xe2\x80\x9d the Hipmunk bot said. \xe2\x80\x9cI searched 736 itineraries. The least agonizing itinerary flies from LGA to ORD.\xe2\x80\x9d Below were nine itineraries, rated one to nine in order of \xe2\x80\x9cleast agonizing\xe2\x80\x9d with times and prices.'b'This bot is fun to play with if you have the time, but it has a ways to go in the accuracy department.'b'For the business traveler, there is 'b'Pana,'b' which, like SnapTravel, combines artificial and human intelligence to plan your trip. The human factor seems to play a more significant role than it did with the other bots I tried.'b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be a business traveler to benefit, but you do need to be a frequent-enough traveler to justify the cost: $49 per month ($499 annually) for its \xe2\x80\x9cconcierge\xe2\x80\x9d plan. But there is a seven-day free trial to start.'b'The involvement of humans may have explained the short delay in Pana\xe2\x80\x99s response to my initial text (three minutes felt like an eternity compared with the other bots), but it also ultimately led to better results.'b'After signing up and giving some basic information, including your email and phone number, Pana asks you for a quick phone call to get to know you a little better. But in keeping with the spirit of avoiding as much human interaction as possible, I passed on that and sought out its A.I. guidance.'b'Pana gives you three ways to start: through email, SMS or its app. I chose SMS and received an introductory hello. I then texted that I wanted to fly from New York to Chicago, leaving next Monday and returning Friday.'b'I got a response from \xe2\x80\x9cJo\xe2\x80\x9d and learned that she is \xe2\x80\x9ca Canadian transplant in Hong Kong, avoiding the snow and loving the urban island life.\xe2\x80\x9d Jo promised to look into my flight options and send them to me shortly. About an hour later, I received four flight itinerary options, sorted by price from lowest to highest.'b'This was as far as I took it, but Pana is designed to be a long-term relationship. Your virtual travel agent can check you into flights and suggest hotels, and then can pivot to concierge-mode to recommend restaurants and activities in your destination city.'b'The greatest sign posted at a public fishing access spot in the United States is on the South Branch of the Au Sable River at a place called the Mason Tract. It reads: \xe2\x80\x9cSportsman slow your pace \xe2\x80\xa6 ahead lies the fabled land of the South Branch. Here generations of fisherman have cast a fly on one of the great trout streams of America. Hunters, too, have roamed these hills in the solitude so bountifully offered. The land is rich in tradition and stands ready to renew your soul. Tread lightly as you pass and leave no mark. Go forth in the spirit of George W. Mason, whose generous gift has made this forever possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'George Mason'b' was a 'b'Michigan'b' industrialist who upon his death in 1954 donated 1,500 acres along the Au Sable River to the state with the caveat that it never be sold or developed. It was just as he left it: a pristine trout stream flowing 138 miles through the north country woods of the northern Lower Peninsula until it finally dumps into Lake Huron.'b'My car was parked in front of the sign. I leaned against the hood as I kicked off my wet waders. I had spent a couple of hours fly fishing there and it was a satisfying afternoon, one that thousands of other anglers have experienced on this river. However, there is great worry about the health of the Au Sable, and many people believe the river is threatened by, of all things, more trout.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s in the form of a fish farm in Grayling, a nearby city. A hatchery was built there in 1914. It was operated by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources back when trout were regularly stocked in the river. When the Au Sable produced sustainable populations of wild trout, the stocking ceased and the hatchery was taken over by Crawford County, which ran it as a seasonal tourist attraction that was difficult to keep in the black.'b'In 2012, the county approached Dan Vogler, a fish farmer, who said he had figured out how to make it a profitable enterprise. It was a decision that would eventually polarize the community and land Mr. Vogler in court.'b'I drove back into Grayling. The river runs through the heart of this town. It runs past Camp Grayling, the largest National Guard training center in the country.'b'It flows past the elementary school, through backyards, next to downtown and eventually out into the country.'b'The Grayling hatchery is right in town, next to the health care center. The gate was locked but from the bridge I could oversee the Au Sable as it flowed into the raceways, a network of regular concrete canals blocked with metal grates that keep the trout in but allow the Au Sable to flow through and out.'b'Nobody was at the hatchery when I visited, but I later spoke with Mr. Vogler by phone. He lives in Harrietta, Mich., about 75 miles away, where he runs Harrietta Hills Trout Farm, also a flow-through hatchery, on Slagle Creek, a tributary of the Manistee River. It, like the Au Sable, is considered one of the best trout rivers east of the Rockies.'b'In 2001, Mr. Vogler and his father bought a private fish farm in Harrietta, which he says is about the same size as the Grayling hatchery. At first, they sold trout to people who wanted to stock their ponds, but now their primary business is growing and selling trout to restaurants and grocery stores.'b'When Crawford County asked Mr. Vogler to consider operating the Grayling hatchery, he determined it was a low-revenue business and not worth the trouble, but after a hard look, he figured the only way he could keep the historic hatchery open for tourism was to be able to raise fish there year round and sell those fish to his customers. He obtained a permit in summer 2013 and signed a long-term agreement with the county. Within 60 days, the 'b'Sierra Club'b' and the 'b'Anglers of the Au Sable'b' challenged the permit.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a discharge permit that does allow for the controlled release of a certain amount of nutrient from our facility, but it\xe2\x80\x99s also an amount that has been determined by the Department of Environmental Quality to be nonharmful to the receiving waters,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vogler said in an interview.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s where the argument starts. That\xe2\x80\x99s been the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s resulted in a rather lengthy hearing in an administrative law court,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, whose ruling he is still awaiting.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow much fish I produce is in a lot of ways irrelevant,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Vogler said, explaining that his permit controls how much waste from the fish can be discharged. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if I raise one fish or one million fish, I cannot exceed those limitations. It\xe2\x80\x99s a hard limit. Thou shalt not discharge more than this.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Vogler is 47, the father of six and a Scoutmaster. He chuckles that he has been described as an aquaculture version of corporate Big Ag. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a small family business,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI sit in my office with my dad and our office assistant literally back-to-back in the basement of my house. That\xe2\x80\x99s our world headquarters.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got dirt under my fingernails, calluses on my hands, and we work hard every day to produce a healthy, affordable, local, fresh food product for people to eat. How does one have local food if one does not allow local production?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I got a tip from a local guide to head to the Ralph A. MacMullan Conference Center, a rustic lodge south of Grayling, on the shore of Higgins Lake. He said a lot of \xe2\x80\x9criver people\xe2\x80\x9d would be there that night.'b'People chatted, sipped on beer and took their seats after some mingling. John Clark, the organizer of the event, explained the concept of a newly formed group called 'b'Celebrate Michigan Rivers'b'. As he explained, there were many conservation groups fighting for the protection of rivers, but that evening was about taking a break from the fight and expressing appreciation for rivers.'b'It was a refreshing evening as Michiganders have fought hard in recent years to protect rivers and clean water. In 2009, grass-roots conservationists settled a 10-year court battle against a Nestl\xc3\xa9/Ice Mountain bottling plant'b' to reduce the amount of water 'b'pumped from trout streams. In northern Michigan, fracking looms as a danger to rivers. And then there is the 'b'Flint River water crisis'b'.'b'I spoke with Josh Greenberg, author of \xe2\x80\x9cRivers of Sand: Fly Fishing Michigan &amp; the Great Lakes Region\xe2\x80\x9d and the owner of the 'b'Gates Au Sable Lodge'b', a historic fly fishing camp on a section of the river called the Holy Water. It is said that if God were to make a perfect trout stream, this would be it. He is a member of the 'b'Anglers of the Au Sable'b', one of the parties challenging the hatchery discharge permit.'b'Mr. Greenberg said that an expert for the anglers\xe2\x80\x99 group indicated that in the summer, the river was already running at levels that exceeded limits for dissolved oxygen set by the State Department of Environmental Quality. \xe2\x80\x9cSo any additional phosphorus would only prove detrimental,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTo me it boils down to: We know this is the most valuable brown trout fishery in the state and this is the largest fish farm. With no great reason economically to do the fish farm, why are we risking the Au Sable fishery for a few jobs?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Crawford County requires Mr. Vogler to have liability insurance for accidents and property damage, but his opponents say that isn\xe2\x80\x99t enough. They want a performance bond in place in the event the river becomes degraded and restoration work needs to be done.'b'The next day I stopped at the 'b'Old Au Sable Fly Shop'b' and spoke with Andy Partlo, a co-owner. He is part of a long line of outfitters who have provided guide services in the Au Sable at the same site since 1868. After some talk about the latest fishing conditions, I asked him about the fish farm.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you hold up a bottle of Au Sable river water, it\xe2\x80\x99s going to look a lot like a bottle of Evian,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou hold up a bottle of agricultural runoff, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to drink it, but boy you could grow some pretty damn big tomatoes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The tomato-enriching water Mr. Partlo refers to contains phosphorus, a universal element in plant growth. In agriculture, phosphorus often comes in the form of animal manure that is later used to enrich farm fields. The effect on an aquatic environment is no different. Before the Clean Water Act, the City of Grayling dumped sewage into the river, which temporarily made the fishing even better, with heavy hatches of insects and fattened trout.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you want that?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Partlo continued. \xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s what else we know: It\xe2\x80\x99s an artificial fishery. The fishing went through this for a while and everything was fine and all of a sudden, we get this massive weed growth in the right conditions in the summer. That takes the dissolved oxygen out of the water and you get massive fish die-offs.\xe2\x80\x9d In those times, more trout would be stocked back into the river, he said, \xe2\x80\x9cso then it becomes an artificial fishery.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The trout are wild. That is a point of pride among anglers on the Au Sable. Much of the river is considered a naturally reproducing trout fishery. There is some stocking near the town of Mio under a dam. The fish get big there. The spot is nicknamed the \xe2\x80\x9ctrophy waters,\xe2\x80\x9d but purist fly anglers stick upstream to pursue the wild ones.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you catch an old brown trout, he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been caught since he was 10 inches long and now he\xe2\x80\x99s the crafty old giant whitetail of the woods,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Partlo said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou did something. It\xe2\x80\x99s wild. You\xe2\x80\x99re part of nature. You beat them at their game. That\xe2\x80\x99s what we stand to lose and that\xe2\x80\x99s the problem.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t stand to lose the fishery. I\xe2\x80\x99d be just as busy. I\xe2\x80\x99d lose a lot of customers, but I\xe2\x80\x99d have a whole bunch more that came in that don\xe2\x80\x99t even care. But that\xe2\x80\x99s not what the Au Sable is about.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d move,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d literally move away.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That afternoon, I fished with Terry Warrington on the North Branch of the Au Sable. Huge explosions thundered in the distance. It was like the beginning of \xe2\x80\x9cRed Dawn\xe2\x80\x9d and rural America was under attack and Terry and I were out fly fishing amid the opening salvos of World War III.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSounds like the National Guard is doing some training over there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said as he waved his fly rod past the tree line. The camp is a large contributor to the local economy. Grayling has little industry and poor soil for agriculture. There is limited logging in the forests cut many times over.'b'In 1998, Mr. Warrington retired from teaching biology and chemistry at Michigan Tech and he and his wife moved to the Grayling area to be close to the Au Sable. At 76, he still fishes the river almost daily.'b'In the air were the blue-winged olives, mayflies no bigger than a speck of fuzz. Mr. Warrington cast his zero-weight fly rod \xe2\x80\x94 one of the smallest rods manufactured \xe2\x80\x94 toward a seam of rising trout.'b'His line and rod snapped tight and a small brook trout splattered the water. He brought it in and released it.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo many people suffer from big fish-itis,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s that they forget what they are out there for and that is for fun.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For the next hour, we took turns casting to the feeding trout. I lost count how many I caught, maybe five or six, and I missed plenty of others.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou were asking about that fish farm,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Warrington said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs you can see now there are hardly any weeds. I remember 40 years ago there were so many weeds you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t even fish. If phosphorus gets into this river it will turn it into a weed bed. And without this river, Grayling wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t exist.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Having long tried to virtually transport listeners to beaches, rain forests and other dreamy respites, meditation apps today are also trying to appeal to people who are actually traveling to such places.'b'Several apps \xe2\x80\x94 including 'b'Buddhify'b', 'b'Calm'b', 'b'OMG. I Can Meditate!'b' and 'b'Simple Habit'b' \xe2\x80\x94 offer specialty meditation sessions for travelers on planes, trains and city streets, making their way across oceans or simply across town, be it \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting at the Airport\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cCommuting: A Mindful Journey.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On my first trips of 2017, I tried several such apps, including some veterans, to see if they could alleviate the stress of long lines, crowded planes and busy streets. Meditation is personal \xe2\x80\x94 the teacher\xe2\x80\x99s voice, words and methods, affect each of us in different ways \xe2\x80\x94 so I didn\xe2\x80\x99t rank the apps. Instead, I\xe2\x80\x99ve highlighted certain features, and to whom they may or may not appeal.'b'Research began at Newark Liberty International Airport, where my plane was being de-iced. I put in earbuds and tapped the \xe2\x80\x9cPrepare for Travel\xe2\x80\x9d session from 'b'Simple Habit'b', an app with meditations for situations as varied as remedying procrastination and easing PMS. Users can choose from sessions that span the vacation process, from \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting at the Airport\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cJust Landed\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cRelaxing on Vacation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAfter Vacation.\xe2\x80\x9d To gain access to all of Simple Habit\xe2\x80\x99s sessions (including those that don\xe2\x80\x99t pertain to travel), you need a subscription ($3.99 for seven days; $11.99 for one month; $99.99 for a year on iOS). As with other app subscriptions, you can cancel through iTunes (I used an iPhone, but the apps are also available for Android).'b'From my plane seat I tapped the \xe2\x80\x9cPrepare for Travel\xe2\x80\x9d session. \xe2\x80\x9cOops, low internet connection,\xe2\x80\x9d the app said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlease check your network.\xe2\x80\x9d I kept trying. I opened a couple of other meditation apps; they worked just fine. I gave up and revisited the \xe2\x80\x9cPrepare for Travel\xe2\x80\x9d session later, days after a trip to Puerto Rico.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTravel can sometimes be a tumultuous experience,\xe2\x80\x9d a male voice said. It instructed me to let the tension in my neck, shoulders and jaw dissolve. A tense traveler might wonder: But how? The voice encouraged me to repeat the words, \xe2\x80\x9cJust this breath. Just this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou just got your seat on the plane?\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust this breath. Just this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a way for you to come back to what\xe2\x80\x99s here, right now,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice added. If you want brief, basic lessons about controlling your breathing, you may enjoy these sessions, more minilectures than silky-voiced meditations. (If you don\xe2\x80\x99t find mantras effective, you may like Buddhify, which has a different technique for bringing you back to the present. More on that momentarily.)'b'Another app, 'b'OMG. I Can Meditate!'b' (access to all sessions, $12.99 a month; $89.99 a year on iOS), offers sessions like \xe2\x80\x9cMindful Walking,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWaiting in Lines,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Places\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMindful Eating,\xe2\x80\x9d which I selected during breakfast.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNotice all the different colors, textures, shades, different food types,\xe2\x80\x9d a female voice said. The travel-related meditations on this app may appeal if you\xe2\x80\x99re beginning to practice mindfulness and want step-by-step instructions. The eating session, for instance, asks listeners to rate their hunger from 1 to 10 to help them learn when they are full. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of us eat because we\xe2\x80\x99re nervous or bored,\xe2\x80\x9d the voice said. Other users, however, may find such sessions too much like pedestrian self-help audiobooks.'b'One morning, I tried 'b'Calm'b' (the company\xe2\x80\x99s website offers lovely, free nature sounds and scenes, perfect for office workers seeking to drown out ambient chatter). The app (access to all sessions, $12.99 a month; $59.99 a year on iOS) has multiday programs such as \xe2\x80\x9cSeven Days of Calming Anxiety,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as meditations including \xe2\x80\x9cCalm Kids,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cDeep Sleep,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cCommuting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cEmergency Calm.\xe2\x80\x9d I tried \xe2\x80\x9cWalking Meditation,\xe2\x80\x9d during which a female voice asks you to notice how you\xe2\x80\x99re moving and what you\xe2\x80\x99re seeing. The commuting and walking meditations were the only travel meditations in the app. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a beginner and want the blithe cadence of certain yoga teachers, you may enjoy these sessions. If sing-songy voices make you think of the sleep teachings used to brainwash children in \xe2\x80\x9cBrave New World,\xe2\x80\x9d you may not.'b'On the plane at Newark I also tested 'b''b'Pause'b''b', a simple, low-cost app ($1.99) with a surprising payoff. Unlike other stress-relief apps that try to keep you in the here and now, this one incorporates touch as well as sound. While it isn\xe2\x80\x99t travel-specific, its ease of use makes it a nifty on-the-go solution. You put the tip of your finger on a small blob and slowly move it around the screen of your phone, like pushing a desktop sandbox with a little rake. (The creators of Pause say it uses principles of Tai Chi.) Move your finger and the blob grows while your ears are bathed with birdsong and breaking waves. As passengers jockeyed for overhead bin space, I guided the blob this way and that. Words appeared. \xe2\x80\x9cGo anywhere.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At first, the idea of Pause seemed as silly as a mood ring. But there is something about slowly guiding your hand to the sound of lapping waves that has you radiating calm before you even set foot on a beach. If you want a quick, surreptitious way to refresh your mind without someone instructing you to tune into your breath, this could be the app for you.'b'Experienced meditators may want to try an oldie but goodie: 'b'Buddhify'b' ($4.99 for iOS and $2.99 for Android), which has a rainbow wheel with a question in the center: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing?\xe2\x80\x9d Users can select slices of the wheel with sessions like \xe2\x80\x9cWalking in City.\xe2\x80\x9d I tapped one that said \xe2\x80\x9cTraveling\xe2\x80\x9d and up came options like \xe2\x80\x9cConnecting with stillness in a busy place\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cA unique meditation for when you\xe2\x80\x99re on a plane.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The latter is about 10 minutes. A soft male voice asks you to notice the sounds of the plane, and the people within. To help you stay present, the voice suggests that when your thoughts drift to the past, you say to yourself the name of the city from which you\xe2\x80\x99re departing. If your thoughts drag you into the future, you say the city where you\xe2\x80\x99re headed. Simple but effective in gently guiding the mind.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDid one of the cities feature more often than the other?\xe2\x80\x9d the voice asked. \xe2\x80\x9cJust that little observation can teach us a lot about where our mind tends to wander, whether to the past or to the future. And the more our mind learns about itself, the stronger it becomes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping.'b'I stumbled into the luxurious 'b'Four Seasons Hotel in Sydney'b' after having suffered through a night at a particularly ratty Airbnb in the Surry Hills neighborhood, a once-scruffy inner suburb about 15 minutes south of the main tourist waterfront. The gleaming, spacious lobby, where Jorge Sousa, the chief concierge, greeted me, was a cruel contrast to the roach-infested, cat-hair-laden rental where I had spent the night tossing and turning. (No matter how good the reviews are, if it\xe2\x80\x99s suspiciously inexpensive, run for the hills.)'b'Mr. Sousa, born in Mozambique to Portuguese parents, started in the hospitality industry when he moved to Australia in 1986. Working at the now-defunct Gazebo Hotel as a bellman, he remembers being in awe of his chief concierge at the time and becoming inspired to follow the same path: \xe2\x80\x9cHow can you make what people perceive to be impossible, to make it possible? And for me, I just wanted to master that art.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After I related my horror-Airbnb story, it was Mr. Sousa\xe2\x80\x99s turn: Concierges all have war stories about guests\xe2\x80\x99 odd requests. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a guest who came from Indonesia, and he really wanted to kill a goat in a room,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me over a cup of coffee. \xe2\x80\x9cWitchcraft had told him that if he didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill a goat within 24 hours, all his family would die. And he was very serious about this particular matter.\xe2\x80\x9d The request was not accommodated. \xe2\x80\x9cEventually the police had to be called,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sousa said, declining to name the hotel where this had happened.'b'I was not there for any ritual sacrifice, however (though my lodging situation had left me considering all possible options). I was instead there to ask Mr. Sousa to create a daylong itinerary for a fictitious high-rolling guest amounting to $1,000, or roughly 1,320 Australian dollars.'b'I would then endeavor to recreate the itinerary \xe2\x80\x94 with some inevitable tweaks \xe2\x80\x94 on a decidedly more frugal $100. 'b'Sydney'b' is a glamorous city that has nearly everything: world-famous landmarks, a glittering harbor, great beaches and food that holds its own against any in the world. It\xe2\x80\x99s expensive, too, making it a fine challenge for the $100 treatment.'b''b'HIGH'b' The chef Bill Granger opened his first place, 'b'Bills'b', in the Darlinghurst neighborhood of Sydney at age 24. His relaxed, feel-good modern Australian cuisine soon widened its reach in multiple locations. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m crazy for their poached eggs,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Sousa said. A \xe2\x80\x9cFresh Aussie,\xe2\x80\x9d with gravlax, kale, avocado, poached eggs and cherry tomato on sourdough toast will run 28.50 dollars. Spice things up with a Bloody Mary made with Korean chile for an additional 18.50.'b''b'LOW 'b''b'Bourke Street Bakery'b', opened in 2004, has become a go-to spot throughout the Sydney area for pastries, breads, sweets and coffee. I recommend the original Bourke Street location, a shop on the corner with a quaint vibe and cute atmosphere. A bowl of crunchy muesli, poached pears, milk and a dollop of tart yogurt cost 8 dollars. (I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking \xe2\x80\x94 yogurt 'b'and'b' milk? Trust me, it works.) A short black (3 dollars) to caffeinate and one of their lemon tarts (5.50) rounded off the meal. That their food tends to be highly 'b'Instagramable'b' certainly doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt, either.'b''b'HIGH'b' If money is no object, why not see the sights from a helicopter? Mr. Sousa recommends the Sydney Heli Grand Flight from 'b'Sydney HeliTours'b', which covers a lot of ground in a relatively short period. In just 30 minutes, tourists can see some of the city\xe2\x80\x99s notable landmarks, including the Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbor Bridge and Sydney Cricket Ground, as well the coastline and well-known beaches like Manly and Bondi. The tour, which costs 350 dollars per person, includes refreshments and transportation to and from your hotel.'b''b'LOW'b' I certainly couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford the chopper tour, but I was hoping to find an alternative that would also let me see the bridge and opera house. I found my solution, believe it or not, in the city\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'public transportation system'b'. In Sydney, whose lifeblood is the harbor and its series of small inlets and bays, hopping a ferry is as natural as hopping a train in New York City.'b'Using my pay-as-you-go Opal card (you add value as needed; this can be done in person, online and even by phone), I hopped a ferry from Circular Quay to Rose Bay. We pulled out of the wharf, passing the opera house and the bridge. From the upper deck of the ferry, mist cooling our faces on the hot day, we headed east, past 'b'Fort Denison'b', a former penal colony, and had fantastic views of the harbor and skyline. Once we arrived in Rose Bay, I simply stayed on the ferry and enjoyed the ride back to my origin point. Rose Bay was really just an arbitrary destination; there is an entire 'b'network of ferry lines'b' to explore. Total cost to me: about 5.75 dollars. Even better, on Sundays you can ride all day for only 2.50.'b''b'HIGH'b' Mr. Sousa wagered that our high roller would enjoy an expensive seafood lunch \xe2\x80\x94 a likely bet, given Sydney\xe2\x80\x99s location and reputation for excellent fish. 'b'Nick\xe2\x80\x99s Seafood Restaurant'b', overlooking the harbor, offers a seafood platter for two (175 dollars) that showcases a veritable cornucopia of marine delicacies: lobster, mussels, rock oysters, fresh and tempura-battered king prawns, blue swimmer crab, calamari and more.'b''b'LOW'b' Sydney does nearly every Asian cuisine well, and Thai is no exception. 'b'Spice I Am'b' has qualities that every lunch spot should strive for: It\xe2\x80\x99s good, fast and inexpensive. An order of fiery pad kee mao with prawns was hugely filling and cost only 14.50 dollars. The chewy noodles with blazing hot chile (I ordered it \xe2\x80\x9cmedium\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 get mild if you can\xe2\x80\x99t handle spice) and Thai basil brought a refreshing food sweat and energized me for the rest of the day.'b'Another worthy contender is the nahm prik nuum sandwich at 'b'Boon Cafe'b', recommended to me by Pat Nourse, the restaurant critic for Australian Gourmet Traveller'b'. 'b'Boon Cafe is a casual spot on Pitt Street that makes up for its slow service (when I was there, at least) with some wonderful dishes. Take a fistful of fresh herbs, pickled cabbage, a dollop of pork sausage and some sinus-clearing Northern Thai green chile relish and you have a sandwich that contends with some of the best I\xe2\x80\x99ve had.'b''b'HIGH'b' The extraordinary 'b'Sydney Opera House'b', the Danish architect Jorn Utzon\xe2\x80\x99s masterpiece, needs little introduction. But few realize that the Dane, who won the commission of the building in a 1957 competition, never got to see the completed structure. After butting heads with the incoming government over suppliers and the cost of materials in 1966, Mr. Utzon left Australia, the opera house unfinished. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until 1973 that it was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II, in a ceremony Mr. Utzon was not invited to.'b'The 165-dollar backstage tour of the opera house, which includes full breakfast and runs around two and a half hours, allows for a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the workings of the venue, with access to the stage and backstage areas. After that, why not take in a show? The Puccini classic \xe2\x80\x9cLa Boh\xc3\xa8me\xe2\x80\x9d is running through March 24 in the Joan Sutherland Theater. You can expect to pay upward of 260 dollars for a decent seat to witness the trials and travails of Rodolfo, Mimi and Musetta.'b''b'LOW'b' Many recognize the opera house\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive profile, but the building\xe2\x80\x99s appearance changes greatly depending on one\xe2\x80\x99s viewing angle. This is because the opera house is actually a grouping of shells housing multiple performance areas, including a 2,679-seat concert hall and a more intimate studio with 280 fixed seats.'b'I passed on the more elaborate backstage tour for the regular 37-dollar one (33.30 dollars when booked online) \xe2\x80\x94 and found it very enjoyable, thanks in part to Laura Gomez, my group\xe2\x80\x99s entertaining and capable tour guide. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A Flea in Her Ear,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Gomez announced matter-of-factly during one stop on our tour, \xe2\x80\x9cis a farce. A farce involves going in and out of doors, up and down stairs, and usually a lover is in a wardrobe.\xe2\x80\x9d The rest of the tour was interesting, a mix of history and a look into the workings of the performance space. A highlight was being able to sit in on a rehearsal of \xe2\x80\x9cCopp\xc3\xa9lia,\xe2\x80\x9d a comic ballet set to the music of Delibes.'b'Instead of taking in a show at the opera house, which would definitely have blown my budget, I went instead to the 'b'Old Fitz Theater'b', at the Old Fitzroy Hotel, about a half-hour walk from the opera house. There I saw a less-polished but still energetic production of \xe2\x80\x9cBabes in the Woods,\xe2\x80\x9d which has ended its run (there are 10 shows 'b'planned for 2017'b').'b'The sharp-tongued comedy, which featured ridiculous costumes and sets done with the charm (and production value) of a Charlie Brown Christmas pageant, was more complex than the brainless farce it seemed to be during the first 10 minutes. There were some pointed critiques of Australian society in the pages of the script, particularly regarding policy toward indigenous Australians. Audience members can boo loudly, cheer lustily and throw pieces of cabbage and bread at the performers (a policy that nearly backfired during the show I attended thanks to one particularly aggressive person), and cast members peddle 5-dollar tinnies, or cans of beer. For 28 dollars, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Puccini, but it was certainly entertaining.'b''b'HIGH'b' Mr. Sousa calls 'b'Aria Restaurant'b' his \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal favorite.\xe2\x80\x9d Matt Moran, the chef, helms this acclaimed fine dining destination, which showcases modern Australian cuisine and favors local produce. A seasonal tasting menu (320 dollars with wine pairing) might feature roasted lamb loin with labneh and cucumber, coral trout sashimi with kombu and chile, or champagne lobster French toast. In addition to elegant food, the restaurant offers some stunning views of the harbor.'b''b'LOW'b' I had a view with my meal, too, but it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the harbor \xe2\x80\x94 it was the Pacific Ocean. 'b'Coogee Pavilion'b', located right on the beach a few miles outside the center of town, is a multilevel, family-friendly destination with a good seafood and pizza selection, a spacious rooftop bar, and entertaining novelty games appropriate for all ages (giant magnetic wall-mounted Scrabble, anyone?). For about 30 dollars, I got a very decent margherita pizza, which I shared with a friend, as well as a Boag\xe2\x80\x99s, a local beer. There is better food to be had in the city, certainly, but I found that the focus in Australia is frequently more on atmosphere than anything else. That\xe2\x80\x99s where Coogee Pavilion excels: a thoroughly enjoyable, no-worries vibe that captures the spirit of Sydney itself.'b'Years ago, a close friend and I cemented a friendship that began in college by splashing our way around 'b'Hawaii'b', on his home island, Oahu. We visited other islands, too, like Kauai, where we waded into the Pacific at Polihale Beach, a remote 17-mile stretch of white sand at the end of the long, rutted dirt road that seems as far away as you can get from anywhere.'b'We swam in that heaving body of aquamarine, and what I remember most is the profound feeling that the ocean water had weight \xe2\x80\x94 that the powerful, muscular waves that lifted me could reverse their force at any time, pounding me into mush on the sand or sucking me far out to the horizon. It was humbling, and not a little frightening.'b'But we were mesmerized by the pulse of the ocean, alive to the sound of the surf and the scent of the briny air. Daring to risk was part of the thrill of swimming out there.'b'I have come to appreciate open water (an ocean, a big lake) as a challenge, a mode of transport. There is an energy to the ocean in particular, an element of danger that requires a giving over of self, that makes swimming in heavy water a kind of holy communion. I see swimming as a way to get to know a place with an intimacy that I otherwise wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have. To swim in the ocean is to immerse myself in wildness, to feel the way the water rises and falls like breath.'b'Six years ago, I floated in the cerulean water at Tunnels Beach, on the north shore of Kauai, while pregnant with my older son, Felix, my sun-warmed belly poking above the waves as I took in the rippling red-and-green cliffs of the Na Pali Coast. Now I wanted Felix to feel that for himself, outside of me, fully aware of the cool water pulsing on his lanky 5-year-old body. Several months ago, my husband, Matt, and I began our sabbatical summer in Kauai, in the little north shore town of Haena.'b'Over three weeks there, we fell into a languorous but satisfying routine. Every morning we would head over from our rental house to Tunnels Beach, named for the distinctive underwater lava tubes \xe2\x80\x94 those long, cavelike tunnels and coral formations so beloved and frequented by divers who swim around and through them. It has a crescent-shape bay with coral reefs and a broad expanse of calm, waist-deep water ideal for snorkeling and swimming. We would go early and leave by noon, when the sun began to exert maximum scorch and the crowds grew thick. Felix was frightened of the sea at first, but little by little he got comfortable in the gently rolling surf.'b'What came, in quick succession, was curiosity and tentative exploration. He bobbed; he practiced his freestyle and his backstroke. He looked for brilliant pink-and-blue parrotfish. There was giddiness at swimming out to the reef; spontaneous underwater somersaults; leaps, with abandon, to bodysurf to the sand alongside the locals.'b'He loved the feeling that the water here was in some way alive, and different from the stillness of a pool. One day he befriended a 50-something bodysurfer named Dave, who shouted encouragement and expertly propelled himself toward shore with \xc3\xa9lan and grace. That evening, my son drew a picture of himself bodysurfing in the waves with his \xe2\x80\x9cnew friend\xe2\x80\x9d Dave.'b'Perhaps there is a welcoming bonhomie we grant to the other swimmers who populate a spot. Everything else is stripped away, to leave the essential shared experience of the water.'b'The pleasures of swimming in a place can be everyday, routine, familiar. In 1779, a lieutenant of Capt. James Cook admired the native Hawaiians\xe2\x80\x99 swimming abilities with an entry in his ship\xe2\x80\x99s log: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Women could swim off to the Ship, &amp; continue half a day in the Water;\xe2\x80\x9d in Hawaiian, Polynesian and other enduring island cultures of the Pacific, men, women and children were all observed as being \xe2\x80\x9calmost amphibious\xe2\x80\x9d from birth.'b'This is as lovely and pure an image of the freewheeling freedom of swimmers as any I have come across. The tradition of the Hawaiian waterman is alive today, as residents grow up frolicking in the waves \xe2\x80\x94 surfing, swimming and paddling as a matter of course, learning the rules of the ocean. Local swim clubs lead guided ocean swims on the weekends to all comers, swims that are a mile and a half along the beach or to an offshore island. That kind of open-water education is the essence of a childhood in Hawaii. This idea takes hold every time I visit.'b'Every morning at Tunnels I swam a mile or more, zigzagging between reefs and following the locals to what they could show me. Once I tailed two spear fishermen, clad in their dusky-green camouflage wet suits, and spotted four large sea turtles resting 15 feet below at the bottom of the ocean, feasted on by tiny fish known as cleaner wrasse; in a marvel of symbiosis, the wrasse detailed their hard shells by Hoovering up parasites and dead skin. An efficient 45 minutes later, the young fishermen emerged from the sea with the day\xe2\x80\x99s catch in hand: huge mahi-mahi, two each. On other days I swam alongside ropy-armed surfers as far as I could before they paddled beyond the outer reef, where the wind whipped whitecaps across the sea. I treaded water and watched safely from within the reef as they made elegant, sinuous turns across the face of each wave as it broke.'b'We became friendly with a young family who lived nearby and whom we saw often during those mornings. The toddler daughter liked to investigate our snacks and toys, and play with our 3-year-old son, Teddy. The father, nut-brown from the sun, sat in the shallows collecting tiny, intricately patterned shells the size of sesame seeds that he said were once collected only by the holiest of Hawaiian priests.'b'One morning as I was swimming in the coral-punctuated shallows, two men called my attention to a four-foot shark resting on its side in the waist-deep water. It was a juvenile, they said, and it had probably died while trying to find its way back to deeper water through the maze of vividly colored near-shore corals, some boulder-size, others cactuslike and still others resembling giant brains with lobes.'b'Later, a lifeguard in sunglasses and red swim trunks roared up in a dune buggy and dragged the shark onto the beach. Bystanders came around to stare at its smooth gray hide, bloodied nose and clouded-over eyes. The episode didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop any of us from swimming. But it was a sobering reminder, welcome or not, of the ocean\xe2\x80\x99s ever-present dangers: sharks, riptides, razor-sharp reefs.'b'These are risks that we swimmers are willing to take for the egalitarian joys that come from swimming in this ocean. Back in Honolulu, one of my favorite swimming spots is Ala Moana Beach along the downtown waterfront. In the middle of the city, steps from high-rise towers, the smooth, reef-protected ocean at Ala Moana serves as the de facto communal pool.'b'Everybody, and every body, is welcome. To swim there with the locals is to experience the place at fish-eye level: Turn your head makai or toward the ocean, to breathe, and there are surfers paddling out to the break; turn your head mauka or toward the mountains, and there are Japanese brides and grooms in white-columned gowns and trim dark suits having pictures taken on their wedding day. From this perspective, everything feels strangely possible: It is a swim through a flipbook of improbable vacation photos all stitched together.'b'An African safari can be an expensive vacation proposition \xe2\x80\x94 many camps in prime game-viewing areas run close to four figures per person per night, and the multiple flights required to reach them ratchet up the cost even more. But a safari in 'b'Africa'b' does not have to blow the bank, said Jenny Mikkelson, a safari specialist at 'b'Travel Beyond'b', a tour operator in Wayzata, Minn. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are ways to drastically cut down on the cost of a safari,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Here, she shares her advice on keeping a safari getaway affordable.'b''b'KNOW WHEN TO TRAVEL'b' Maximize your budget by traveling in so-called shoulder season, a period that is a few months before or after peak season and varies with different safari regions, including 'b'Botswana'b', 'b'Kenya'b' and 'b'South Africa'b'. In Botswana, for example, the busiest time with the highest prices is between June and October. In May and November, however, prices at many lodges drop by as much as 30 percent or more, and the game viewing is just as rich. To save even more \xe2\x80\x94 up to 50 percent \xe2\x80\x94 consider a trip to Botswana from December through March, known as \xe2\x80\x9cgreen season\xe2\x80\x9d because the normally dry and brown landscape is lush with greenery.'b''b'STICK TO ONE BRAND'b' Most safari-goers, Ms. Mikkelson said, visit multiple camps on the same trip to experience different ecosystems, activities and animal viewing offerings, but few know that if they stay at properties within the same portfolio, discounts may be in store. \xe2\x80\x9cYou often get a break on accommodations (up to 30 percent), free nights, flight transfers between lodges and other perks, which amount to a big savings,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Brands with multiple lodges in Africa include 'b'Andbeyond'b', 'b'Asilia Africa'b', 'b'Nomad Tanzania'b' and 'b'Wilderness Safaris'b'.'b''b'FOR SOUTH AFRICA, GET A QUOTE IN LOCAL CURRENCY'b' Almost all safari lodges and hotels in South Africa are priced in South African rand. This means that tour companies and camps in the country that quote a price for your trip in American dollars have a hedge worked into their pricing because the exchange rate of the local currency may fluctuate before your final payment \xe2\x80\x94 a hedge that is never in the traveler\xe2\x80\x99s favor. \xe2\x80\x9cBe sure the company you\xe2\x80\x99re working with quotes you a price in South Africa rand so when you pay for your trip, you\xe2\x80\x99re getting the price based on the currency that day as opposed to one that may be marked up and hedged,\xe2\x80\x9d Ms. Mikkelson said.'b''b'WATCH FOR PROMOTIONS'b' Ms. Mikkelson says many safari camps have specials that they do not necessarily promote but that can save guests big bucks. These deals may include getting 30 percent off regular room rates for booking early, discounts for stays longer than five nights and add-ins such as a hot-air balloon ride at sunrise if you are celebrating a special occasion. And you are in luck if you are on your honeymoon: Ms. Mikkelson says some lodges give newlyweds 25 percent off the usual daily rate.'b'The new year has already brought about significant changes to our world, including the way some of us travel. It also commemorates, less significantly, the one-year anniversary of my taking over the 'b'Frugal Traveler'b' column. (No applause, please.) The old clich\xc3\xa9 \xe2\x80\x9ctime flies\xe2\x80\x9d rings true: It really does seem like yesterday that I wrote 'b'my first column from Las Vegas'b'. I\xe2\x80\x99ve also spent entirely too much time actually flying this past year. But at least all that airtime has yielded lessons \xe2\x80\x94 some more painful than others. Here are five of them, picked up during my travels through 10 countries and a dozen states in 2016.'b''b'CARRY VALUABLES ON YOUR PERSON'b' When my Megabus from Chicago to Milwaukee 'b'burst into a fireball'b' on the side of the highway, I was among the lucky ones. I had settled on a budget carrier that loudly advertises fares as low as $1 (mine was a still-cheap $11). We quickly realized something was wrong when the bus turned around halfway through the trip and headed back to Chicago, and some passengers noticed a burning smell. A fire had started in the wheel well and, within minutes, had consumed the entire bus, along with people\xe2\x80\x99s luggage.'b'While the experience was harrowing, I was traveling with only a backpack, and so didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose any of my possessions in the ensuing blaze. Others lost thousands of dollars in property, including clothes, laptops and schoolbooks. One man I spoke with lost nearly everything he owned, including credit cards and personal identification. A good rule of thumb, regardless of method of transit, is to carry particularly valuable or irreplaceable property \xe2\x80\x94 phone, 'b'Social Security'b' card, passport and the like \xe2\x80\x94 on your person. No matter how brief the trip \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s only 90 miles between Chicago and Milwaukee \xe2\x80\x94 a lot can happen in a short distance.'b''b' TO EAT LIKE A LOCAL, GET IN LINE'b' Travelers frequently ask me for tips on finding good, cheap meals overseas. I typically recommend thinking like a local: going to grocery stores, farmers\xe2\x80\x99 markets and, if your stomach can handle it, eating street food. Another good tip is simple but effective: Follow the crowds. The idea is that if there\xe2\x80\x99s a long line of locals outside a restaurant, that\xe2\x80\x99s usually a sign that there\xe2\x80\x99s something good being cooked inside.'b'I did that during a trip to 'b'Osaka, Japan'b', with great results. I spotted a long line outside a dingy storefront near the train station. It was approaching lunchtime, so I hopped in line, not knowing what to expect. After a short wait, we were taken upstairs to a cramped, atticlike restaurant with a flat-top grill, behind which stood a man casually ladling a mixture for okonomiyaki \xe2\x80\x94 a pancake with cabbage, dashi, pork, onions and seafood \xe2\x80\x94 onto the grill. It was hearty, satisfying and delicious: a perfect example of the casual home-style specialties Osaka is famous for.'b'The best-case scenario with this approach is that you make a wonderful new food discovery, as I did. Worst-case, you\xe2\x80\x99ve waited for the Japanese equivalent of a Cronut, and at least have a good story to tell when you get home.'b''b'MAKE SURE YOUR RENTAL CAR IS COVERED'b' The question of whether or not to get 'b'rental car insurance'b' baffles many travelers, and while there is no hard and fast rule for every situation, I learned a valuable lesson the hard way. In a remote area of the Big Island of Hawaii, I blew two tires and had to be towed over 100 miles back to the Hilo airport. I had not bought the liability insurance from the rental company and paid for the two tires out-of-pocket. Little did I realize that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the end: Over a week later, I received an email from Hertz demanding more than $1,400 because of scratches on the wheels.'b'What was I to do? Fortunately, the credit card I used to make the rental, a Chase Sapphire Preferred card, came with built-in coverage for the rental car itself (but not liability insurance for other parties). Through a somewhat arduous process of submitting every receipt and document under the sun, I was able to have the card\xe2\x80\x99s insurance cover the cost. Had that failed, I could have asked my personal 'b'auto insurance'b' to step in. The bottom line: Know your coverage before you begin driving. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have personal insurance, you\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely want to make sure you either buy the rental company\xe2\x80\x99s insurance (which can be very expensive) or make the purchase on a credit card that includes vehicle coverage (and you may want to supplement with liability coverage, which often isn\xe2\x80\x99t included).'b''b'WITH AIRBNB, STAY WITH A LOCAL'b' Airbnb is a fraught topic in some major urban centers, particularly New York City, where it\xe2\x80\x99s effectively illegal for short-term rentals of entire apartments (as opposed to sharing a space). But the app is an undeniable force in the travel world. And while it\xe2\x80\x99s definitely nice to have your own space, I\xe2\x80\x99ve found that Airbnbs contribute far more to the value of a trip when they\xe2\x80\x99re shared with a local. If you\xe2\x80\x99re truly looking for a \xe2\x80\x9clocal\xe2\x80\x9d experience, why not let an actual local guide you?'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s important to understand that, strictly speaking, that\xe2\x80\x99s not the job of your host. You\xe2\x80\x99re paying him or her for a place to stay, not to be a tour guide. But more often than not, when I\xe2\x80\x99ve stayed in an Airbnb with a longtime resident (check owner bios on the site, which are frequently full of useful information), particularly a retiree, they\xe2\x80\x99ve been extremely eager to share knowledge and tips, even going so far as to personally take you places. My host 'b'in Moscow'b', Natalya, took me to a local market and gave me advice on bathhouses in the area. When I 'b'traveled to New Zealand'b', I stayed in the home of a kind woman who drove me around the northern island, taught me the names of local trees and plants, and even a bit of New Zealand slang. It\xe2\x80\x99s not something you can expect from every host, but it\xe2\x80\x99s an added perk that can tremendously improve a traveler\xe2\x80\x99s experience.'b''b' GREAT DEALS? BOARD A BOAT'b' It\xe2\x80\x99s easy to focus on flights and hotels, but some of the best bang-for-your-buck deals today are actually found on the open seas. I took a seven-night 'b'cruise to the Dominican Republic'b' in September that cost $250 \xe2\x80\x94 a price so low that some passengers were wondering out loud if they might be allowed to move onto the ship permanently. While taxes and fees (and a single supplement if you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling solo) will certainly raise the price, this cruise aboard Fathom\xe2\x80\x99s Adonia, which includes a room and all food, but not alcohol, is still amazingly cheap. (The lowest price currently available is $299 for an interior cabin.)'b'And it\xe2\x80\x99s not your typical booze cruise. While you\xe2\x80\x99ll still be expected to dance to \xe2\x80\x9cY.M.C.A.\xe2\x80\x9d every now and again, the focus was volunteer work in communities around the Dominican town of Puerto Plata. Passengers were given the option to teach English, help in a women\xe2\x80\x99s cooperative, install cement floors, and plant trees, among other activities.'b'My activity, teaching English, was brief but rewarding. I helped a girl learn the English alphabet and numbers one afternoon in the sweltering heat of her family\xe2\x80\x99s home. The volunteer experience raises questions about the efficacy of untrained passengers coming to work for a very short period of time, but the value of the person-to-person experience was undeniable.'b'In the jacket copy of his 1961 poetry collection \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spice-Box of Earth,\xe2\x80\x9d a 20-something 'b'Leonard Cohen'b' wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cI have to keep coming back to 'b'Montreal'b' to renew my neurotic affiliations.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Soon, the city\xe2\x80\x99s cherished son followed his inclinations toward music, and would eventually achieve global-icon status thanks to his signature talent for such pensive sentiments. The brooding vocals and philosophical lyrics of anthems like \xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHallelujah\xe2\x80\x9d earned him nicknames like the \xe2\x80\x9cgodfather of gloom\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cpoet laureate of pessimism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Somewhere along the way, though, Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s hometown anxieties softened into affection. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel at home when I\xe2\x80\x99m in Montreal \xe2\x80\x94 in a way that I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel anywhere else,\xe2\x80\x9d he told an interviewer in 2006. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it is, but the feeling gets stronger as I get older.\xe2\x80\x9d Proof of that can still be found today along the streets of Montreal\xe2\x80\x99s Little Portugal, which served as his hometown headquarters for the latter half of his life.'b'Artists and immigrants (first Jewish, later Portuguese) have shared this sliver of the greater Plateau neighborhood for close to a century. Today, locals still trade anecdotes about spotting Mr. Cohen at his favorite restaurants or having a friendly chat with him along The Main, Montreal vernacular for Boulevard St.-Laurent, the Plateau\xe2\x80\x99s cultural artery.'b'True to his dust-jacket proclamation, the nomadic Mr. Cohen returned to Montreal sporadically throughout his adult life, and so, until 'b'his death'b' in November at the age of 82, if your timing was fortuitous, you might have seen him on the steps of the gray stone triplex he purchased just off The Main in the early 1970s. With his often-present laptop perched on his knees, it\xe2\x80\x99s where he exchanged pleasantries with neighbors he\xe2\x80\x99d known for decades or called out to acquaintances lingering in the pocket-size Parc du Portugal across Rue Valli\xc3\xa8res.'b'During a recent attempt to retrace Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with my adopted home city \xe2\x80\x94 spurred on by the fact that, until his death, I had not known that we were such close Plateau neighbors, living only a 15-minute walk apart \xe2\x80\x94 I discovered that the best evidence that he reveled in Montreal\xe2\x80\x99s comfortable clasp was found on his feet.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne day he was in back of me at the bakery,\xe2\x80\x9d Ida Ponte, a manager at the 'b'J. Schreter'b' apparel store on The Main, told me as she recalled her visits to another St.-Laurent staple, Les Anges Gourmets. Like many Little Portugal mainstays, Les Anges offers a cross-cultural array of goods, as renowned for its French patisserie as for its Portuguese egg custard tarts, pasteis de natas. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know he was there and he just leans over and whispers to me, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re the only one who knows I\xe2\x80\x99m wearing slippers.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s preferred footwear for padding around Little Portugal \xe2\x80\x94 always the same Foamtreads slippers, purchased at J. Schreter \xe2\x80\x94 illustrated his rapport with the middle-class neighborhood that served as his Montreal home base after a childhood spent in the tonier Westmount enclave. Sotto voce and sly-humored, polite and without airs, Mr. Cohen exuded a big-hearted bonhomie for the people and for the places he loyally patronized.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the thing that stands out more than anything else for me: He liked to wear a very comfortable slipper as a shoe,\xe2\x80\x9d said Steve Schreter, who now owns the business, founded by his father\xe2\x80\x99s cousin. \xe2\x80\x9cIt didn\xe2\x80\x99t prevent him from walking around the street.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In fact, little did. When in town, Mr. Cohen was a creature of habit, returning to a string of family-owned businesses found along The Main, all easily reached by foot. ('b'\xe2\x80\x9cSuzanne,\xe2\x80\x9d'b' his most famous example of Montreal-set songwriting, references the city\xe2\x80\x99s Old Port several miles away.) His favorite locales are, as he was, Montreal institutions.'b'Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s days routinely began with a freshly pulled espresso at Bagel Etc., a 35-year-old diner and cafe where vintage mirrors, signage and art run amok on the brick walls. You might assume the d\xc3\xa9cor was inherited from the antiques shop that once occupied the southern half of Bagel Etc.\xe2\x80\x99s double storefront, but as Simon Rosson, an owner, told me, \xe2\x80\x9csome of it\xe2\x80\x99s from a funeral home.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Beyond bagels \xe2\x80\x94 one or two varieties, delivered from nearby Fairmount Bagels \xe2\x80\x94 the breakfast-and-lunch menu builds on the appealingly scattershot feel of the place. Its famous huevos rancheros are offered alongside sweet and savory blintzes, knockwurst and pepperette, and for dessert, strudel \xe2\x80\x94 which, when I ordered it in December, was charmingly if incongruously accompanied by a tuft of canned whipped cream topped with a single red grape.'b'Mr. Rosson got into the habit of opening early for Mr. Cohen when he starting working at the shop in 2001. \xe2\x80\x9cI was smoking my cigarette outside one morning, and he\xe2\x80\x99s peeking through his window to see if I\xe2\x80\x99ve actually opened the doors,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know he\xe2\x80\x99s not going to eat anything, so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter if I don\xe2\x80\x99t have anything prepared. I can make the guy an allong\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a tall espresso. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I wave him down, like, \xe2\x80\x98Leonard, just come on.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When he was occupying his preferred stool at the counter, television, of all things, became a favorite topic for Mr. Cohen. (Brass nameplates honoring regulars line several booths at Bagel Etc.; Mr. Cohen\xe2\x80\x99s stool marker was presumably swiped by a fan years ago.)'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was always on his laptop. He was talking about Project Free TV, this website to get free TV shows,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Rosson recalled. \xe2\x80\x9cHe says, \xe2\x80\x98Brother\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 always \xe2\x80\x98brother\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98friend\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x98have you seen \xe2\x80\x9cJohn From Cincinnati\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Cohen was referring to a short-lived HBO drama starring his onetime fianc\xc3\xa9e, Rebecca De Mornay.) Ms. De Mornay, he said, had called Mr. Cohen and asked his opinion of the show. Mr. Rosson then told him, \xe2\x80\x9cGive me her phone number, because I want to phone her and say, \xe2\x80\x98What the heck\xe2\x80\x99s going on in this show?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d (He used a bluer expression than \xe2\x80\x9check.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Farther south along the boulevard, Mr. Cohen (who was a vegetarian for a few years in the 1960s) indulged his love for Montreal\xe2\x80\x99s acclaimed smoked meat, or viande fum\xc3\xa9e, a local specialty made from high-fat beef brisket that\xe2\x80\x99s typically salted and cured for a week before being smoked, steamed and hand-sliced to order. \xe2\x80\x9cI like this place because it\xe2\x80\x99s open all night,\xe2\x80\x9d he told the now-defunct Montreal Daily News in 1988, referring to 'b'Main Deli Steak House'b', a scruffy Jewish deli he famously frequented (a newspaper clipping is displayed near the door). \xe2\x80\x9cThe smoked meat tastes great, too, especially after five months on the road.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indeed, the menu appears tailor-made for the ravenous, after-hours crowd; you can get a jumbo hot dog or a 20-ounce \xe2\x80\x9cjumbo rib steak,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as dauntingly hearty dishes like spaghetti with smoked meat. A traditional viande fum\xc3\xa9e sandwich served on mustard-soused slices of rye, however, makes for a decadent lunch on its own.'b'If Mr. Cohen felt a kinship with local proprietors based on common geography and ancestry, another quality they shared was an ability to self-reinvent. When J. Schreter opened in 1928, its customers included peddlers who resold their no-frills apparel to farmers and similar clientele. When Mr. Cohen posed for a photo with the family outside the store in 1986 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cCan I come into your picture?\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Schreter recalls Mr. Cohen asking as he walked by \xe2\x80\x94 their sign still noted \xe2\x80\x9cGros et Detail\xe2\x80\x9d (wholesale and retail) merchandise.'b'Today, J. Schreter\xe2\x80\x99s attractive racks of clothing, shoes and accessories come from fashion-forward brands known for classic styling, like Ben Schwartz Oxford shirts, Tom\xe2\x80\x99s shoes and Herschel backpacks.'b'Nearby, 'b'Quincaillerie Azores'b', where Mr. Cohen purchased items for small home repairs (many executed free by the Pereira family, which owns the business), tells a similar story. Gabriel Pereira arrived in 1956 from the Azores archipelago off the Portuguese coast. In 1968, he opened his hardware store and began serving the construction trade.'b'These days, under the management of Mr. Pereira\xe2\x80\x99s five adult children, the store has become Quebec\xe2\x80\x99s largest seller of roosters of Barcelos. Tour groups schedule stops at Azores to pick up the vibrantly hued, ornamental birds traditionally given in Portuguese culture as good-luck presents for weddings and housewarmings. \xe2\x80\x9cThere used to be a lot of Portuguese families that lived here, but I would say toward the end of the \xe2\x80\x9980s, you would see less,\xe2\x80\x9d said Kevin Pereira, one of the second-generation owners. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Plateau started to be pricey, more expensive. We adapted.\xe2\x80\x9d Housewares and gifts occupy the window displays, including fine examples of Portuguese clay pottery.'b'At 79-year-old 'b'Moishes Steak House'b', a well-known establishment where Mr. Cohen dined several nights a week, the modifications are more subtle. Graffitied canvases contrast with the sumptuous leather, velvet and brick textures of the interior, while an after-9 p.m. menu introduced about five years ago brings a younger demographic through the doors.'b'Moishes also boasts a back story that Mr. Cohen would have appreciated: After immigrating from Romania in the 1920s, Moishe Lighter worked at the restaurant, then called Saffrin\xe2\x80\x99s, when he won it from Mr. Saffrin in a poker game in 1938.'b'Mr. Cohen would always arrive at Moishes with company and greet its current owner, Leonard, one of Moishe\xe2\x80\x99s sons, with the same jovial if mysterious hello: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna get us, Leonard. They\xe2\x80\x99re never gonna get us.\xe2\x80\x9d He would request lamb chops and a red Bordeaux. \xe2\x80\x9cHe loved our lamb chops.

Taiwan offers possibilities for farm-to-table dining that don\xe2\x80\x99t exist in Singapore and Hong Kong. Surrounded by clean waters and dotted with mountains and fertile plains, with more than 20 microclimates and a deeply embedded small farming tradition recently given new life by urbanites going back to the land, Taiwan places its agricultural bounty within easy reach of diners in the capital.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow everyone is talking about local ingredients,\xe2\x80\x9d the Taiwanese chef Andr\xc3\xa9 Chiang said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have everything here, and we should be proud of it.\xe2\x80\x9d Serving ingredient-focused contemporary Taiwanese cuisine, Mr. Chiang\xe2\x80\x99s two-year-old RAW is just one of a growing number of restaurants, ranging from casual to upscale, that are riding the wave of a growing \xe2\x80\x9ceat local\xe2\x80\x9d movement.'b'Anchored by a sinuous cloud-shaped bar hand-carved from two colossal hunks of pine, the dining room at RAW is cavernous and murky, strikingly backlit by a semi-open kitchen. Instagram-friendly pin lights illuminate tables, which are set far apart and have hidden drawers for flatware.'b'The seasonal set menu of eight courses and a few smaller bites (with optional wine pairings), eschews dish names in favor of shortened ingredient lists (\xe2\x80\x98Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99 Rice Pork Mushroom, no commas). Mr. Chiang, who worked in France before he opened Singapore\xe2\x80\x99s acclaimed 'b'Restaurant Andr\xc3\xa9'b', where he spends most of his time, devises the menu at RAW with two Taiwanese chefs, Zor Tan and Alain Huang.'b'Every dish on the menu is Taiwanese \xe2\x80\x9cin form, structure, color or flavor,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Chiang said. A skewered baby corn cob coated with kernels from a mature cob and slicked with deeply smoky barbecue sauce winked at the sort of fare you might find in Taipei\xe2\x80\x99s night markets, while Beef Tongue Cracker, an oblong crisp with shavings of velvety ox tongue arranged atop a smear of caramelized onions, confit egg yolk with vinegar for dipping, was a sly nod to ox tongue crackers, a classic Taiwanese snack named for their shape. That Rice Pork Mushroom dish? Pure comfort food, served steaming and fragrant in a miniature clay pot, grains glistening with lard, infused with fungal earthiness and enhanced with chunks of tender meat.'b'At a nearby table an elegantly dressed Taiwanese woman, obviously perplexed by a shallow bowl containing a single sheet of dried squid, laughed aloud as it separated into curly noodles when a server poured hot kombu broth over. She ate every bite.'b''b'RAW, No. 301 Le Qun Third'b''b' Road; 886-2-8501-5800; 'b'raw.com.tw'b'. Lunch and dinner tasting menu, 2,680 Taiwanese dollars (about $87) 'b''b' per person, plus 10 percent service charge.'b''b'Tairroir, which opened last May on the sixth floor of a building next to RAW, is, in appearance at least, its polar opposite: intimate (just eight tables) and elegant (white-on-white dining room, sleek copper bar). The French training of Kai Ho, the Taiwanese chef, is reflected in both his restaurant\xe2\x80\x99s name (a mix of Taiwan and terroir) and in refined plating, with color and texture highlighted in smears, dabs, dots and drizzles.'b'But Mr. Ho is quick to add: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not French. I\xe2\x80\x99m Taiwanese. And I do my own thing.\xe2\x80\x9d The result is a set menu (six or eight courses) that crosses Taiwanese ingredients with French technique. During my lunch only one dish, warm pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e accompanied by buttery mushroom brioche, bowed toward the west; others were unequivocally Taiwanese in spirit if not form. In Mr. Ho\xe2\x80\x99s hands taro cake, a Chinese New Year favorite, became a spoonable mash to be stirred together with a sous-vide egg, the combination\xe2\x80\x99s richness cut by dried sakura shrimp and crispy shallots.'b'A magnificent dessert combined moist purple cakes tasting of concentrated blueberries with a powerfully lemony mousseline, bracingly tart yogurt \xe2\x80\x9csnow\xe2\x80\x9d and honeycombed pong tang, a traditional Taiwanese hard candy.'b'When it comes to sourcing ingredients Mr. Ho said he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnot as hard-core as some chefs. I\xe2\x80\x99m not at the farm every day.\xe2\x80\x9d But he estimates that about 90 percent of what he uses in the kitchen is local; on the day we met he was excitedly planning a visit to a fish farmer in nearby Yilan county to investigate a tip about local caviar.'b''b'Tairroir, 6F, No.'b' 'b'299 Le Qun Third'b''b' Road; 886-2-8501-5500; 'b'tairroir.com'b'. Tasting menu (lunch) 1,650 or 2,350 Taiwanese dollars and (dinner) 3,200 or 5,000 dollars per person, plus 10 percent service charge.'b''b'MUME, which opened around the same time as RAW and shares its capital-letters-only naming approach (mume is the botanical name for the plum blossom, Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s national flower), channels a Nordic sensibility, with a cozy dining room gently lit by the glow of a marble bar and Scandinavian-style bentwood chairs flanking tables lit by low-hanging pendant lights. \xe2\x80\x9cModern European casual fine dining,\xe2\x80\x9d in the words of Richie Lin, an owner and one of three chefs, captures the spirit of the place \xe2\x80\x94 elegant and suitable for a special night out, welcoming and wallet-friendly enough to be your neighborhood hangout.'b'After Mr. Lin experienced some frustration with the scarcity of local ingredients in Hong Kong, where he was born and had worked (he grew up in Canada), Taiwan appealed as fertile ground on which to pursue his goal of cooking with the seasons, alongside two other expat chefs: Kai Ward (Australian) and Long Xiong (American). MUME is \xe2\x80\x9ca chance to discover what is unique and special about Taiwan,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand to showcase it to the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nordic influence is on the menu, too, in a starter of warm country sourdough with beer butter and smoked beef fat butter, modeled after a popular bread course at Noma. After that, the menu divides into Snack, Smaller, Bigger, Sweeter. I would return in a heartbeat for baby potatoes, which are thickly dusted with dried shiitake crumbles. The mushroom crumbs bear a whiff of the forest floor and notes of coffee and bitter chocolate that deepen when mixed with the accompanying cultured butter.'b'The Taiwan salad is a stunner: 30 ingredients that change by the day (I identified nasturtium leaves, flower petals, tiny broccoli florets, pickled cherry tomatoes and roasted carrots), dressed not with vinegar or citrus but umami, in the form of salted black beans. There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of showmanship in crisp-tender blush prawns bathed in coral sauce made with prawn head fat and layered with jicama batons and wisps of fresh dill; frozen ricotta is dusted over the bowl, releasing a dry ice cloud. Each mouthful is a shock of brine and milk and grassiness, amplified by crunch and cold.'b''b'MUME, No.'b' 'b'28 Siwei Road; 886-2-2700-0901. Average dinner for two is 2,900 dollars, plus 10 percent service charge.'b''b'Before arriving at YEN (yet another all-caps venture), the Hong Kong-born Hoi Ming Wo cooked in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia. In Osaka, he led the Xiang Tao restaurant to its first Michelin star. But he had never been to Taiwan, so before starting as executive chef he traveled the island to eat, and inspiration struck: \xe2\x80\x9cI realized that, hey, there are a lot of really great local ingredients,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I knew that was where I wanted to focus at YEN.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Atop the W Hotel, YEN is as stylish as one would expect: bold colors (deep violet and pink), inventive artwork (wall sculptures incorporating kitchen tools), a wall of windows overlooking Taipei\xe2\x80\x99s urban sprawl. Much of the long menu is composed of dishes one might find in a restaurant of similar caliber in Hong Kong: succulent roast meats and fowl, steamed fish priced by the pound, double-boiled soups. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll also unearth gems, examples of what Mr. Wo describes as Taiwanese-Cantonese fusion.'b'Delicate cones filled with crispy green apple sticks and pan-fried slices of mullet roe are all crunch and tartness with a bracing hit of piscine saltiness. Mi tai mu, an iconic street dish of stubby rice flour noodles made like spaetzle and usually eaten in soup, are here served in a Cantonese-style lobster broth whose sumptuousness is bolstered by rafts of sweet loofah gourd.'b'For a main dish Mr. Wo steams chunks of lobster from Penghu (islands in the Taiwan Strait) \xe2\x80\x94 very tender, unlike Boston lobster, he said \xe2\x80\x94 and sets them in a shallow bowl in the center of a creamy \xe2\x80\x9cocean\xe2\x80\x9d of egg white; a tangle of bird\xe2\x80\x99s nest adds crunch. There\xe2\x80\x99s nothing Taiwanese about YEN\xe2\x80\x99s custard buns, but order them anyway: Served warm, dusted with semi-bitter cacao and shaped like mushrooms, they ooze golden eggy custard.'b''b'YEN, 31F, W Hotel, No. 10 Zhongxiao East Road, Section 5; 886-2-7703-8768; 'b'yentaipei.com/en'b'. An average meal for two is 3,500 dollars.'b''b'I\xe2\x80\x99d never been a fan of hot pot until several years ago, when a friend in Taipei introduced me to fermented cabbage hot pot at a restaurant called Lao Zhou. Eighteen months ago Han Chen, a native of Taichung, on the country\xe2\x80\x99s western coast, who managed Lau Zhou for his uncle, struck out on his own and opened Mr. Meat, where he melds a passion for fermentation and a reverence for Taiwan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgrannies\xe2\x80\x9d (Mr. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s term for small producers of traditional ingredients) with a pure love of meat.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFermented ingredients have sourness without acidity and combine well with meat,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fat smooths the ferment while the ferment brings out the meat\xe2\x80\x99s sweetness.\xe2\x80\x9d Diners choose from a selection of broths made with seasonal ferments (cabbage in fall, garlic in winter, kimchi in spring, tomato in summer). The individually sized hot pots come preassembled, ready to cook at personal burners.'b'Fermented garlic soup sounds stinkier than it tastes; on a cool December day it was salve for the soul, bracing, reviving, appetizing. Packed with vegetables (taro, bamboo, radish, white cabbage), bean curd three ways (skin, frozen, preserved), meatballs, dumplings and flavorings like red dates and wolfberries, it made a fine base for a selection of thinly sliced meats.'b'Taiwan produces little beef or lamb, so Mr. Chen imports some red meats from Europe, the United States and Australia. But there\xe2\x80\x99s also gamy cherry duck (a Taiwanese breed), gui ding chicken (tastier than your average bird) and Taiwanese black pork. It would be unwise to pass on a side order of Granny\xe2\x80\x99s Braised Carrot Minced Meat, an insanely luscious pork ragu made according to a recipe provided by Mr. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s grandmother-in-law, served over rice.'b'Before opening his restaurant Mr. Chen traveled Taiwan in search of exceptional ingredients. In Meinong, a center of Hakka culture, he found a husband and wife making tofu skin with soy milk heated over a wood fire; in Tainan, a woman making fine fish dumplings filled with pork. Some are named on the menu, like Master Wu of Tainan, a classical painter-turned-fermentation specialist.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI see the restaurant as a platform. I love the ingredients and I want you to know who made them,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Chen said. \xe2\x80\x9cMake the grannies happy, make the grannies proud.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Mr. Meat Hot Pot and Butchery, rear entrance No.'b' 'b'85 Lane 31, Dunhua South Road Section 2; 886-2-2703-5522; 'b'www.mrmeat.co'b'.
