b'Dave Fleischer \xe2\x80\x94 a short, bald, gay, Jewish 61-year-old with bulging biceps and a distaste for prejudice \xe2\x80\x94 knocked on the front door of a modest home in a middle-class neighborhood on the west side of Los Angeles. It was an enthusiastic knuckle-thump, the kind that arouses suspicion from dogs in yards halfway down the block but, crucially, can also be heard by humans watching cable news at high volume.'b'If he had his way, Fleischer would knock on doors with a golf ball. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what the Mormons use,\xe2\x80\x9d he said on this sunny, bird-chirping Saturday in February. Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s staff at the Los Angeles-based Leadership Lab \xe2\x80\x94 which goes door to door to reduce bias against L.G.B.T. people, with a current focus on transgender discrimination \xe2\x80\x94 didn\xe2\x80\x99t take to the golf-ball suggestion, but Fleischer wanted me to know that he is \xe2\x80\x9cnot opposed to stealing a good idea from the Mormons.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A gray-haired Hispanic woman named Nancy cracked open the front door, though not enough to let her little dog eat our ankles. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re out talking to voters about an important issue \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer began, only to have Nancy excuse herself and walk away. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure she would return; the last two voters he\xe2\x80\x99d met pleaded busyness. But after shooing the dog into another room, Nancy appeared in her doorway again. She smiled shyly and asked Fleischer, the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s director, how she could help him. Had he been completely honest, he might have said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to make you less prejudiced. It could take awhile.\xe2\x80\x9d But instead he began with a simple question: If she were to vote on whether to \xe2\x80\x9cinclude gay and transgender people in nondiscrimination laws,\xe2\x80\x9d would she be in favor or opposed?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn favor,\xe2\x80\x9d she assured him. Fleischer asked her to rate that support on a scale from zero to 10. \xe2\x80\x9cA 10,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have friends who are gay.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A typical canvassing conversation might have ended there. Nancy, it seemed, was a supporter \xe2\x80\x94 no need to worry about her. But Fleischer is wary of what he calls the \xe2\x80\x9canti-discrimination declaration.\xe2\x80\x9d At the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s two-hour pre-canvass training that morning, volunteers were warned about \xe2\x80\x9cfake 10s,\xe2\x80\x9d people who think of themselves as against discrimination \xe2\x80\x94 many of them Democrats \xe2\x80\x94 but who can nonetheless be swayed by emotion-based appeals that provoke prejudice and fear.'b'Those appeals worked last November in Houston, where the same voters who elected a lesbian mayor in 2009 repealed a city ordinance protecting transgender people from discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations. Armed with a \xe2\x80\x9cno men in women\xe2\x80\x99s bathrooms\xe2\x80\x9d message, anti-L.G.B.T. groups argued that transgender people (or those pretending to be) would pose a threat to children in public restrooms. One group aired a 'b'lurid television ad'b' of a man following a frightened, wide-eyed young girl into a bathroom stall. Though there was currently no ballot measure in Los Angeles to worry about, there was a palpable urgency to the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s work. A few days before, the Human Rights Campaign released 'b'a report'b' warning about 44 anti-transgender bills filed in 16 states. Then, last month, the North Carolina General Assembly passed a bill preventing cities and counties from enacting their own anti-discrimination legislation, stripping existing protections.'b'At the door, Fleischer asked Nancy if she knew any transgender people. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t. He then did something few political consultants would advise: He introduced her to the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s favorite argument. He handed her a small video player, on which she watched a Baptist minister in Houston make the case about bathrooms. Fleischer then returned to his scale, asking Nancy what number felt right for her now. \xe2\x80\x9cI know I\xe2\x80\x99m in favor of gays, because I\xe2\x80\x99ve worked with them and socialized with them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think they\xe2\x80\x99re wonderful. But for transgenders? Give me a five.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nancy wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the only person to significantly decrease her support after watching the video. Across the street, a man in his late 30s who said he was liberal and pro-L.G.B.T.-rights moved to a five from an eight, explaining that he was deeply worried about \xe2\x80\x9cthe bathroom issue.\xe2\x80\x9d The man\xe2\x80\x99s concern seemed informed by his experience in a New York City nightclub; he hinted at his discomfort standing at a urinal next to a drag queen. Nancy had no such seemingly relevant personal experiences, nor did she appear particularly concerned about bathroom safety. For her, the video seemed to clarify that Fleischer was specifically asking her about transgender people, a group she had no experience with and seemed to have little inherent empathy for. To get Nancy to a true 10 capable of withstanding opposition messaging, Fleischer needed to help her \xe2\x80\x9ctap into her own empathy and connect emotionally to transgender people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fanned out across the neighborhood were more than three dozen Leadership Lab volunteers, many of them local college students, as well as progressive activists from around the country hoping to learn about changing voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds. Over the last six years, Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s unorthodox canvassing technique has attracted the attention of social scientists, liberal groups and even presidential-campaign consultants. It has also attracted controversy. In 2014, Science published a study claiming to show that an approximately 20-minute conversation with a gay or lesbian canvasser trained by Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s team could turn a gay-marriage opponent into a supporter. But Science 'b'retracted the study'b' five months later, after the lead author couldn\xe2\x80\x99t produce his data and admitted to lying about aspects of the experiment\xe2\x80\x99s design.'b'The fraudulent study called into question the validity of the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s deep-canvassing approach. Had it all been wishful thinking? Maybe, as The Wall Street Journal suggested, Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s efforts merely \xe2\x80\x9cflattered the ideological sensibilities of liberals.\xe2\x80\x9d But this week, 'b'a new study published in Science'b' by David Broockman, an assistant professor of political economy at Stanford, and Joshua Kalla, a graduate student in political science at Berkeley, appears to serve as vindication of Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s work. Leadership Lab-trained volunteers were 'b'found to be successful at reducing transgender prejudice'b' in front-door conversations, the effects persisting months later in follow-up surveys.'b'Betsy Levy Paluck, an associate professor at Princeton who studies bias, believes the study will have broad implications for those in her field. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do social scientists know about reducing prejudice in the world? In short, very little,\xe2\x80\x9d she writes in the same issue of Science, adding that the new study\xe2\x80\x99s results \xe2\x80\x9cstand alone as a rigorous test of this type of prejudice-reduction intervention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fleischer is planning more interventions. Though he has devoted much of his political and community-organizing career to L.G.B.T. issues, he believes this kind of canvassing could change people\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on everything from abortion and gun rights to race-based prejudice. He also hopes it will usher in a new era of political persuasion. \xe2\x80\x9cModern political campaigns have focused mostly on communicating with people who already agree with them and turning them out to vote,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer says. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what we\xe2\x80\x99ve learned by having real, in-depth conversations with people is that a broad swath of voters are actually open to changing their mind. And that\xe2\x80\x99s exciting, because it offers the possibility that we could get past the current paralysis on a wide variety of controversial issues.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'It took a 'b'devastating loss at the ballot box for Fleischer to see the political wisdom in heart-to-hearts with strangers. In 2008, he was in Ohio mobilizing African-American and Latino voters for Barack Obama when California residents passed Proposition 8, banning same-sex marriage in the state. Fleischer headed west to work with the Los Angeles L.G.B.T. Center, which houses the Leadership Lab, and proposed an unusual idea to his new colleagues: Canvassers should talk to Prop 8 supporters about why they had voted against same-sex marriage. Then they should try to change the voters\xe2\x80\x99 minds.'b'The idea grew out of Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s own experience as a \xe2\x80\x9cJewish, liberal gay kid\xe2\x80\x9d in Chillicothe, Ohio. He likes to say that he has been talking to people who disagree with him since he was 4. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I would have only talked to people who agreed with me, I would have only talked to my mom and dad,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cInteracting with people different than me was a normal thing, and certainly not undesirable or scary. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost the opposite of growing up today in the age of Facebook and political polarization, where it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to always be among like-minded people, your self-isolation complete before you have your first beer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At first, Fleischer and his team tried cerebral arguments and appeals to fairness in their doorway conversations with same-sex-marriage opponents who didn\xe2\x80\x99t express deep religious objections. \xe2\x80\x9cThat failed miserably,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Eventually, the canvassers tried eliciting more emotional experiences. They urged voters to talk about anyone they knew who was gay or lesbian \xe2\x80\x94 and, more important, to speak about their own marriages. \xe2\x80\x9cThat changed everything,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer told me. \xe2\x80\x9cMost people consider marriage the most important and meaningful thing they ever did. Talking about marriage brought up deep emotion. If marriage was the most valuable thing in their own life, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they also want their gay friends \xe2\x80\x94 or gay people \xe2\x80\x94 to experience it, too?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though Fleischer thought his new approach was working, he wanted to know whether the persuasion lasted. During a 2013 trip to New York City, he visited the Columbia Univer\xc2\xadsity political-science professor Donald Green, whose experiments on voter behavior \xe2\x80\x94 including his findings that canvassing is a more effective mobilization tool than telephone calls or direct mail \xe2\x80\x94 partly inspired a focus on building a ground game, a strategy mastered by the Obama campaign.'b'Green was skeptical that the canvassers were as persuasive as they thought they were. His previous research suggested that \xe2\x80\x9cpeople don\xe2\x80\x99t change their mind very easily, and when they are persuaded to think differently, the effect is usually temporary,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. But he also knew that political persuasion had not been studied often. \xe2\x80\x9cRemarkably, we don\xe2\x80\x99t know very much about what forms of campaign communications are most persuasive,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Green connected Fleischer with Michael LaCour, then a U.C.L.A. graduate student in political science and statistics, who said he could design a study to assess the long-term effectiveness of Leadership Lab canvassers at increasing support for same-sex marriage among voters in Los Angeles who had supported Prop 8. LaCour, joined late in the process by Green as a co-author, published the results in the December 2014 issue of Science. The study claimed to find that though both gay and straight canvassers were effective at the door, only voters contacted by gay canvassers remained persuaded nearly a year later.'b'The study made international news and seemed to confirm what many gays and lesbians believed in their guts: that knowing a gay person is a powerful antidote to anti-gay bias. It also seemed to bolster the \xe2\x80\x9ccontact hypothesis\xe2\x80\x9d theory of prejudice reduction, which finds that personal contact decreases bias against a minority group. Previous research, though, including a study of teenagers in an Outward Bound program assigned to either mixed-race or all-white groups, suggested that lasting prejudice reduction happened after weeks of regular contact. LaCour appeared to be breaking new ground, showing that one brief but memorable interaction could reduce prejudice.'b'Broockman and Kalla were intrigued by LaCour\xe2\x80\x99s findings and hoped to replicate it for an experiment measuring the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s transgender canvassing. But the more they analyzed LaCour\xe2\x80\x99s study design and results, the more problems they found. Yes, Leadership Lab volunteers had spoken to voters in Los Angeles about gay marriage. But when pressed, LaCour couldn\xe2\x80\x99t produce any evidence that he had conducted the follow-up surveys of voters that would have been essential to measuring canvassing\xe2\x80\x99s long-term influence. He also admitted to lying about having received funds for his study from several organizations, including the Ford Foundation.'b'A shocked and embarrassed Green requested that Science retract the study; soon after, Princeton rescinded a teaching offer to LaCour. News of the retraction stunned Fleischer, who worried that the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s marriage canvassing would be tainted by association. He vowed to keep at it, but soon there was no need. When the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage nationwide in 2015, Fleischer and his team could turn their focus to the next L.G.B.T. battlefield: transgender rights.'b''b'Though there is'b' scant research on transgender prejudice, what is known suggests transgender people face \xe2\x80\x9cwidespread prejudice and discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d Aaron Norton and Gregory Herek wrote in their 'b'2012 study'b' of heterosexual attitudes toward transgender Americans. The year before, 'b'a survey'b' of more than 6,000 transgender and gender-nonconforming people revealed that an astonishing 41 percent had tried to commit suicide.'b'To test whether transphobia could be overcome during a face-to-face encounter, Broockman and Kalla measured a 2015 canvassing effort in Miami by volunteers from the Leadership Lab and SAVE, a local L.G.B.T. organization. The groups feared a backlash against a recent ordinance that prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. The experiment divided voters into a \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment\xe2\x80\x9d group engaged in a conversation intended to reduce transgender prejudice and a \xe2\x80\x9cplacebo\xe2\x80\x9d group targeted with a conversation about recycling. Before the canvass conversations, both groups completed what they believed to be an unrelated online survey with dozens of social and political questions, including some designed to measure transgender prejudice. After the canvass, the groups filled out four follow-up surveys, up to three months later.'b'Broockman and Kalla found that the treatment group was \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderably more accepting of transgender people\xe2\x80\x9d and that a single, approximately 10-minute conversation with a stranger \xe2\x80\x9ccan markedly reduce prejudice for at least three months.\xe2\x80\x9d Unlike LaCour\xe2\x80\x99s invented finding that the messenger matters more than the message, Broockman and Kalla found that both transgender and nontransgender canvassers were effective. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s too bad that the takeaway was that only gay people could persuade people about gay marriage,\xe2\x80\x9d Broockman says about LaCour\xe2\x80\x99s retracted study. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone basically ignored the canvassing aspect, and that the message and the quality of the conversation at the door is what seems to matter.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Broockman and Kalla point to Leadership Lab canvassers\xe2\x80\x99 ability to engage voters in two prejudice-reduction behaviors at the door: \xe2\x80\x9cperspective taking\xe2\x80\x9d (the ability to empathize with another\xe2\x80\x99s experience) and \xe2\x80\x9cactive processing\xe2\x80\x9d (deep or effortful thinking). Both were on display during many of the canvass conversations I observed, including the one with Nancy, the woman who moved to a five from a 10 after watching the opposition video.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs this the first time you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought about transgender people?\xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer asked her soon after she backtracked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, I would say so,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI know it exists, and I hear stories, and I see them on TV. But I don\xe2\x80\x99t have any friends like I do my gay friends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Fleischer nodded and removed a picture of his friend Jackson from his wallet. \xe2\x80\x9cFor me, I never had a transgender friend I was really close to until I was 56,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, handing Nancy the picture. \xe2\x80\x9cJackson grew up as a girl, but he knew even when he was 5 or 6 that he was really a boy. It was only in his 20s that he started to tell his folks the truth, and he started making the transition to living as a man. He\xe2\x80\x99s married to a woman now, and he\xe2\x80\x99s so much happier. And he can grow a better beard than I can!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nancy laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s the thing \xe2\x80\x94 they\xe2\x80\x99re happier when they come out, whenever everybody knows,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She seemed to be connecting Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s experience to that of her gay friends.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight, because otherwise you have the biggest secret in the world, and everyone thinks something about you that\xe2\x80\x99s not true,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer said, before pivoting to a story about Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s being demeaned by a waiter in a restaurant. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like seeing people mistreat Jackson. To me, protecting transgender people with these laws is just affirming that they\xe2\x80\x99re human.\xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer then steered the conversation to Nancy\xe2\x80\x99s experiences with discrimination. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve probably had a time when people have judged you unfairly?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, yes,\xe2\x80\x9d Nancy said. Over the next few minutes, she recounted several instances of racism after moving to Los Angeles from Central America with her husband. Still, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear emotional in retelling the experiences. Fleischer wasn\xe2\x80\x99t surprised; people rarely feel safe enough at first to express deep hurt. It usually isn\xe2\x80\x99t until Fleischer opens up about his own experience \xe2\x80\x94 including feeling different in his small, conservative Ohio town \xe2\x80\x94 that voters feel safe to \xe2\x80\x9cget vulnerable, too,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. Nancy had mostly dismissed Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chow did that make you feel?\xe2\x80\x9d questions, but his personal story prompted a shift. As Fleischer returned to the discrimination she had faced, Nancy paused and said, \xe2\x80\x9cIt felt terrible.\xe2\x80\x9d A few minutes later, when he asked her if she saw a connection between \xe2\x80\x9cyour experience and how you want to treat transgender people,\xe2\x80\x9d she said she did. \xe2\x80\x9cI see transgender people as the same as I see myself,\xe2\x80\x9d Nancy told him. She ended a solid 10, a rating he was confident could survive opposition messaging.'b''b'Earlier that morning'b', Leadership Lab volunteers sat on stackable chairs and watched video clips of front-door encounters on a projector screen. Fleischer\xe2\x80\x99s team videotapes many of its conversations with voters, then \xe2\x80\x9canalyzes the tape like a football team might so we can figure out what\xe2\x80\x99s working and what\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d explained a field organizer, Steve Deline.'b'Knocking on a stranger\xe2\x80\x99s door is scary, and a lot of that morning\xe2\x80\x99s training session was spent boosting the confidence of first-time canvassers. The leaders worked to keep the mood relaxed and optimistic. Fleischer does improv in his spare time, and the training sometimes felt like a well-oiled comedy routine. When the subject turned to potentially awkward initial encounters with voters, the Leadership Lab staff member Laura Gardiner and the longtime volunteer Nancy Williams (who is transgender) did some front-door role-playing.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHi, my name is Laura, and I\xe2\x80\x99m with the Leadership Lab,\xe2\x80\x9d Gardiner told Williams, channeling a shy first-time canvasser. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you have a few minutes today to talk about transgender people?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Williams played a busy voter. \xe2\x80\x9cNo, I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to teach my hamster to speak Finnish today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Gardiner turned to the volunteers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to avoid asking for permission,\xe2\x80\x9d she told them. \xe2\x80\x9cJust dive in. Treat it like the most normal thing in the world. Like, of course we\xe2\x80\x99re on your doorstep on a Saturday talking about transgender issues!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Moments later, Williams reminded the volunteers to be open and nonjudgmental. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re asking voters not to discriminate, to be less prejudiced, and we need to walk that walk,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat means not making assumptions based on the voter\xe2\x80\x99s age, race or their religion. Some folks may have a crucifix on the door. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t tell you about the person inside.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On this particular day, volunteers would be canvassing in a predominantly black neighborhood, so Gardiner reminded them to be sensitive to experiences of race-based discrimination. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat an African-American person has faced because of their race is not the same as the discrimination that I\xe2\x80\x99ve faced for being bisexual, or that my friend has faced for being transgender,\xe2\x80\x9d she told the group. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there is a similarity, because at the root there\xe2\x80\x99s the feeling of being judged, of having someone make assumptions about you, and that does not feel good.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But sometimes the gulf between the volunteer and the voter can seem insurmountable. After the first canvass I attended, the Leadership Lab project manager Ella Barrett seemed uncharacteristically sullen. When I asked how her day went, she shook her head and recounted a series of disheartening conversations with voters she couldn\xe2\x80\x99t persuade. In one, a social worker (\xe2\x80\x9ca social worker!\xe2\x80\x9d Barrett marveled) announced that being transgender is a mental illness; in another, a man matter-of-factly said he hoped to develop a \xe2\x80\x9cstraight pill\xe2\x80\x9d to change gay people.'b'Though not all voters would engage emotionally, I was surprised by how many did. Canvassers often had to politely extricate themselves after 20 minutes \xe2\x80\x94 voters were sad to see them go. \xe2\x80\x9cIf only I could have 10 minutes with Ted Cruz,\xe2\x80\x9d Fleischer said once. He was only half joking. Fleischer has an unwavering confidence in his ability to persuade most people to be \xe2\x80\x9cmore empathetic and less prejudiced,\xe2\x80\x9d and his optimism is shared by progressive groups who train with him. The day before one canvass, representatives from an animal rights group told me they hoped to better understand how to help people connect emotionally to animal welfare.'b'Fleischer is especially interested in learning whether deep canvassing can affect people\xe2\x80\x99s thinking on two issues \xe2\x80\x94 racial prejudice and abortion rights. Beginning in 2014, the Leadership Lab teamed up with Planned Parenthood to canvass in support of pro-choice policies. Though the abortion debate is less obviously rooted in prejudice than transgender discrimination, Fleischer and his canvassers noticed that many voters reacted negatively to a short video of a middle-aged woman recounting having an abortion when she was 22. People would often be \xe2\x80\x9cvery judgmental\xe2\x80\x9d of the woman on the video or any woman who had had an abortion, Fleischer said. To combat that, canvassers tried to get voters to reflect about challenging decisions they had made in their own sex lives or relationships \xe2\x80\x94 or times they were judged harshly. Volunteers also encouraged people to talk about anyone they were close to who had an abortion.'b'Eager to know if his abortion canvassing was persuasive, Fleischer asked Broockman and Kalla to measure it. But the researchers found that the persuasion attempts had \xe2\x80\x9czero effect,\xe2\x80\x9d Broockman said. Still, Fleischer isn\xe2\x80\x99t ready to give up. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause abortion is such a politically polarized issue,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cit could just be that we have to get better at making voters trust us and open up.\xe2\x80\x9d But it could also be that the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s transgender canvassing success is an anomaly. While a discussion of transgender rights can trigger deeply ingrained feelings about sex and gender roles, the issue is also a fairly recent political consideration for many people. Melissa Michelson, a political-science professor at Menlo College in Atherton, Calif., who studies voter mobilization and public attitudes on L.G.B.T. issues, told me that changing people\xe2\x80\x99s minds about transgender rights might simply come down to \xe2\x80\x9cwhich side gets to a voter\xe2\x80\x99s door first to do the persuading.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'What\xe2\x80\x99s the best 'b'way to convince a voter at the door? Though most political canvassing today is focused on mobilizing supporters, an increasing number of researchers, think tanks and campaign operatives have \xe2\x80\x9cturned their attention to persuasion in the last few years,\xe2\x80\x9d says Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s Donald Green.'b'Jeremy Bird, a Hillary Clinton adviser who was the national field director for Obama\xe2\x80\x99s 2012 re-election effort, told me that his team conducted a number of experiments to try to have a greater impact when canvassing. \xe2\x80\x9cWe studied everything, from the kinds of conversations we should be having to the characteristics that made a voter persuadable,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe trained our volunteers to connect with voters at the door on a personal and values level, not to talk at them with scripted talking points. I think people don\xe2\x80\x99t talk enough about the focus on persuasion we had, because the story line became, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, they won because turnout was so high.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Becky Bond, a Bernie Sanders campaign adviser and an admirer of the Leadership Lab\xe2\x80\x99s work, says that the Sanders campaign has focused on marshaling the enthusiasm of volunteers to persuade people. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t think of a campaign that\xe2\x80\x99s put more volunteers on the ground in a primary season to have quality, face-to-face conversations with voters,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me.'b'Still, the Leadership Lab is unusual in its focus on quality over quantity. A typical state or national campaign, even one with a ground-game focus, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want its volunteers spending 10 or 15 minutes at a door. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\xe2\x80\x99re talking about having real, quality conversations with voters, you can\xe2\x80\x99t bring that to scale without a really large number of people,\xe2\x80\x9d says Tim Saler, a Republican strategist at Grassroots Targeting, which works to mobilize and persuade voters. \xe2\x80\x9cTechnology has helped a bit with the scale challenge, but there\xe2\x80\x99s always the question: Do you knock on as many doors as possible, or do you knock on fewer doors and have potentially more fruitful interactions?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s also a lot that can go wrong when fresh-faced canvassers descend on unfamiliar neighborhoods. In 2004, for example, some 3,500 orange-hat-wearing Howard Dean supporters (many bused in from around the country) managed to annoy Iowa voters days before the state\xe2\x80\x99s Democratic caucus. \xe2\x80\x9cThe curse of the orange hats,\xe2\x80\x9d read a headline in Salon. There are other potential problems. \xe2\x80\x9cCanvassers can get mugged, they can get lost, they can get attacked by wild geese,\xe2\x80\x9d Michelson told me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know if they\xe2\x80\x99re at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s on their iPhone, and you can\xe2\x80\x99t always be sure what they\xe2\x80\x99re saying to voters. That lack of control scares campaigns. It\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to put all your volunteers in a cozy phone bank where everyone gets to hang out and eat pizza.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though Fleischer prefers talking to voters face to face, he isn\xe2\x80\x99t opposed to sequestering volunteers in a phone bank to help L.G.B.T. activists in another state. In 2014, Fleischer and his team modified their canvassing work to persuade and mobilize voters by phone. Leadership Lab volunteers spoke with 3,330 residents in Pocatello, Idaho, a small, heavily Mormon city facing a ballot referendum that would have reversed a local nondiscrimination ordinance protecting gay and transgender people. The effort helped defeat the anti-L.G.B.T. ballot measure by a mere 80 votes.'b''b'After a long 'b'day of canvassing on that Saturday, tired but exuberant volunteers returned for a debriefing. One canvasser stood up and spoke of moving a man to a seven from a three. Another \xe2\x80\x94 a tattooed student who identifies as gender-nonconforming \xe2\x80\x94 proudly recalled persuading a voter \xe2\x80\x9cwho clearly had no experience with anyone who identified as being outside the gender binary. He said I blew his mind, and that he would never forget the conversation we had!\xe2\x80\x9d Meg Riley, a 60-year-old Unitarian Universalist minister from Minnesota who volunteers with a racial-justice group, recounted her eventful day. Her second conversation, she said, was with a black man in his 50s who was a seven on the 10-point scale. The man\xe2\x80\x99s daughter, though, would have none of it: She practically pushed him out of the way to tell Riley they were a 10. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m with Black Lives Matter, and I know a lot of trans people,\xe2\x80\x9d the woman told Riley. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re a 10! This family is a 10!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Several of Riley\xe2\x80\x99s conversations proved poignant. She told voters about her own transgender child, Jie, now an adult. She recounted that when Jie was 3, the toddler responded to a question about possible Christmas presents by asking: \xe2\x80\x9cCould Santa turn a girl into a boy?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Riley\xe2\x80\x99s devotion to Jie had a visible impact on several voters, including the mother of a 7-year-old girl. The woman eventually told Riley that she had voted against gay marriage in California, but that she now regretted that choice. \xe2\x80\x9cI made a mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. On the issue of transgender rights, the woman seemed mostly supportive but stopped at a nine. She said she was trying to evolve on the issue, though. As Riley prepared to leave for the next house on the block, the woman called out. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me a few years, and I know I\xe2\x80\x99ll be a 10!\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''b''b'Forget the images'b' of men in hard hats standing before factory gates, of men with coal-blackened faces, of men perched high above New York City on steel beams. The emerging face of the American working class is a Hispanic woman who has never set foot on a factory floor. That\xe2\x80\x99s not the kind of work much of the working class does anymore. Instead of making things, they are more often paid to serve people: to care for someone else\xe2\x80\x99s children or someone else\xe2\x80\x99s parents; to clean another family\xe2\x80\x99s home.'b'The decline of the old working class has meant both an economic triumph for the nation and a personal tribulation for many of the workers. Technological progress has made American farms and factories more productive than ever, creating great wealth and cutting the cost of food and most other products. But the work no longer requires large numbers of workers. In 1900, factories and farms employed 60 percent of the work force. By 1950, a half-century later, those two sectors employed 36 percent. In 2014, they employed less than 10 percent.'b'For more than a century, since the trend was first documented, people have been prophesying a dire future in which the working class would no longer work. In 1964, a group of prominent liberals wrote President Johnson to warn of a \xe2\x80\x9ccybernation revolution\xe2\x80\x9d inexorably creating \xe2\x80\x9ca permanent impoverished and jobless class established in the midst of potential abundance.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Machines have taken the jobs of millions of Americans, and there is every indication that the trend will continue. In October, Budweiser successfully tested a self-driving truck by delivering beer more than 120 miles to a warehouse in Colorado. In December, Amazon opened a small convenience store near its Seattle headquarters that has no cashiers. Customers \xe2\x80\x94 for now, Amazon employees only \xe2\x80\x94 are billed automatically as they leave the store. In January, Bank of America opened branches in Denver and Minneapolis that are staffed by a lone employee, A.T.M.s and video terminals. And Americans are making a growing share of purchases online: about 8.4 percent of retail sales in 2016. These changes are driven by consumer preferences, not just by corporate cost-cutting imperatives. People like shopping in bed in the middle of the night. People like that computers make fewer mistakes. And people grow accustomed to computers. A few years ago, I watched a woman walk up to a bank teller and ask where she could find an A.T.M. The teller asked if she could help. No, the woman said, she just needed to withdraw some money.'b'But the forecasters were wrong in the most important respect. Workers continue to find work, but now the jobs are in service. Taking care of aging baby boomers, in particular, has become by far the largest driver of job growth in the American economy. Among the occupations the Bureau of Labor Statistics expects to grow most rapidly over the next decade: physical-therapy assistants, home health aides, occupational-therapy assistants, nurse practitioners, physical therapists, occupational-therapy aides, physician assistants. ... You get the idea. Nine of the 12 fastest-growing fields are different ways of saying \xe2\x80\x9cnurse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 1950, service work made up about 40 percent of working-class labor in the United States. By 2005, that share had climbed to 56 percent, according to data from a 2013 analysis by the economists David Autor at M.I.T. and David Dorn at the University of Zurich. The available evidence, Autor said, suggests that this trend has continued \xe2\x80\x9cvery rapidly\xe2\x80\x9d over the last decade, increasing the share of American workers who work in the service industries.'b'The rise of service-sector employment reflects the fact that Americans on average have more money to spend and that we are spending relatively less of that money on physical goods, because those goods have become cheaper. It took 10.5 hours of work at average wages to buy a bicycle in 1979; it took just four hours in 2015. Most Americans don\xe2\x80\x99t want a second and third bicycle, so that leaves more money for other purposes. And increasingly, the money is spent on services: help around the home, entertainment and vacations and, most of all, education and health care.'b'These jobs are difficult to mechanize or to perform with greater efficiency. Convalescents cannot be trained to eat more quickly. A phlebotomist cannot draw blood from two arms at once. Robots, as yet, cannot change diapers. Moreover, consumers may have an emotional investment in seeing this caring work performed by people rather than machines. They may be willing to pay for a personal touch.'b'Another limitation on our ability to program computers to do the work of people is summarized by the observation of the Hungarian scientist Michael Polanyi that \xe2\x80\x9cwe can know more than we can tell.\xe2\x80\x9d Consider the work of a security guard, who is basically tasked with sounding the alarm if something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem right. Technology improves security, but it is not easy to write a formula approximating intuition.'b'The Cassandras, however, were right to warn about poverty in the midst of abundance. Personal-service providers \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cservants,\xe2\x80\x9d as they once were called \xe2\x80\x94 tend to be poorly paid. There is little job security; the benefits are meager; the work is physically demanding and emotionally draining. It is not particularly surprising that women and immigrants have been more likely to take these jobs than native-born men. For many of the caretaking service jobs, less than 10 percent of the work force is male.'b'The wages of service work increasingly determine the welfare of the American working class and, to a substantial degree, the broader economy. But politicians have paid little attention. That\xe2\x80\x99s partly because Americans continue to view service work as a way station, not a way of life. Teenagers get their first job at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s; mothers dip back into the work force as receptionists; seniors make a little extra money as Walmart greeters. The reality is that these are the kinds of jobs millions of Americans hold for their entire working lives. And increasingly, these are the jobs their children will perform, too.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x94Binyamin Appelbaum 'b''b'Santa Clara, Calif. \xe2\x80\xa2 The Home Health Aide'b''b'By Elise Craig'b''b''b'Two major events'b' in Ofelia Bersabe\xe2\x80\x99s life persuaded her to become a home health aide. In 2008, the Bay Area electronics company where she worked for 21 years as a sample-department supervisor let her go in a mass layoff. And that same year, her mother, whom she followed to the United States from the Philippines nearly two decades earlier, died. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she passed away in my arms, I felt that I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t given her the full attention I wanted to,\xe2\x80\x9d Bersabe said. \xe2\x80\x9cI promised myself that I would concentrate on taking care of women, especially seniors. In that way, I feel like I\xe2\x80\x99m still taking care of her.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Nine years later, at age 69, Bersabe is among nearly a million Americans who work as home health aides, a field that is expected to grow 38 percent by 2024, faster than most other occupations, thanks in large part to the aging baby-boom population. Already a senior herself, Bersabe works 65 hours a week caring for two elderly clients with dementia. She spends five 12- and 14-hour night shifts in her clients\xe2\x80\x99 homes, providing companionship, reminders to take medicine and light housekeeping for one client, and everything from bathing and dressing to diaper changing for the other.'b'Having two jobs is partly a necessity and partly a hedge; should one of her clients die, she can still rely on income from the other. She also needs the money. Because she is a member of the Service Employees International Union Local 2015, the agencies that Bersabe works for pay her $16.13 and $11 an hour. California\xe2\x80\x99s current minimum wage is $10.50, but the living wage for someone like Bersabe is $11.29.'b'Bersabe is grateful for the money and has no complaints about her wages, but she acknowledges that making a living in the Bay Area\xe2\x80\x99s technology bubble is tough. She lost her house after the 2008 layoff, and she and her husband, who works nights as a security guard, now share a three-bedroom apartment rental behind Levi\xe2\x80\x99s Stadium, where the 49ers play, with two other elderly couples.'b'The gratitude Bersabe\xe2\x80\x99s clients show her \xe2\x80\x94 one kisses her when she arrives \xe2\x80\x94 is incredibly fulfilling, she said, but the work is hard. Dementia patients can be very unpredictable. \xe2\x80\x9cI have a very tame cat, and when they start to have sun-downing\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the late-afternoon confusion that can be a symptom of dementia \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI have a wild tiger,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not the person herself, it\xe2\x80\x99s the sickness.\xe2\x80\x9d Once, when a client began to get agitated and yell at Bersabe, she sneaked around to the front door and rang the doorbell. The client welcomed Bersabe as an old friend that she hadn\xe2\x80\x99t seen in a long time.'b'Bersabe expects to work through her 70s and 80s and maybe even into her 90s. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll work as long as I can stand on my own two legs,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAs long as I can drive and walk and God permits me, I\xe2\x80\x99ll enjoy the job I love.\xe2\x80\x9d Bersabe has no intention of being a burden to her three children, who have families of their own and are scattered from Kentucky to the Philippines. \xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, I am thinking, when the time comes, who is going to take care of me?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother my kids. I want them to see me as a kicking woman, like I was before.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Elise Craig is a freelance writer and editor based in San Francisco.'b''b'Brooklyn \xe2\x80\xa2 The Hair Braider'b''b'By Jazmine Hughes'b''b''b'On a recent 'b'visit to Jennifer\xe2\x80\x99s Beauty World, in Flatbush, Brooklyn, Sonia Ufot started by detangling my tightly coiled hair and blow-drying it pin-straight, then she parted a small section into an individual plait, wrapped a section of filler hair around the root and braided it straight down for 16 inches. She repeated this step around 80 more times, over the course of about six hours, all that time spent either standing or hunched over on a high stool. \xe2\x80\x9cIt takes time and patience for you to be able to stand on your feet for hours to braid somebody\xe2\x80\x99s hair,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cso you really have to love doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ufot, 38, has known how to braid since she was 15; she picked up the skill in Warri, Nigeria, where she was born. A family friend owned a braiding shop, and she visited every day, watching the women do their work and, eventually, persuading them to let her practice on their customers\xe2\x80\x99 heads. She majored in economics at Delta State University in Nigeria, but while she was at school, she found out she had thyroid cancer and eventually moved to the United States for treatment. She started braiding hair for the money and never returned to economics. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s more money doing hair,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. And because she\xe2\x80\x99s in such high demand, Ufot can work 12 to 15 hour days, sometimes seven days a week, depending on appointments. She charges between $100 to $250 for each style, depending on its intricacy. She hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone on vacation in five years.'b'Unlike most people trained in cosmetology, braiders, many of whom are immigrants, don\xe2\x80\x99t use chemicals, sharp objects or heat; just a comb, oil, water and their hands. Individual states legislate the requirements for becoming a licensed hair braider; in several, braiders \xe2\x80\x94 even those with a pre-existing knowledge of braiding \xe2\x80\x94 are required to complete more than 2,000 hours of training at cosmetology schools, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars and whose classes have almost nothing to do with styling black women\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Many cosmetology schools don\xe2\x80\x99t even offer braiding instruction.'b'In 2016, Iowa ended its cosmetology-license requirement for hair braiders, allowing them instead to pass basic health-and-sanitation exams with the state; Nebraska, too, recently ended its laborious stipulation of 2,100 hours of cosmetology training for natural hair braiders. In New York, braiders are required to obtain a natural-hair license, which allows the stylists to perform the chemical-free techniques of styling black hair \xe2\x80\x94 for example, shampooing hair, applying extensions, making dreadlocks, braiding \xe2\x80\x94 and not much else. It costs about $70 and mandates schooling, which costs more. But many braiders operate without licenses.'b'Ufot wants to go to cosmetology school; her goal is to enroll by year\xe2\x80\x99s end, if she can get enough financial aid. She figures it will cost her about $15,000, so she\xe2\x80\x99ll continue braiding and attend night classes as long she can get someone to look after her 6-year-old daughter. She told me that she wants to learn how to do all types of hair \xe2\x80\x94 dyeing, perms \xe2\x80\x94 and dreams of owning her own shop. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to get my cosmetology license so I\xe2\x80\x99m able to do all of the things,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me, laughing. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be able to cut white people\xe2\x80\x99s hair!\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Jazmine Hughes is an associate editor for the magazine.'b''b'Cicero, Ill. \xe2\x80\xa2 The Fast-Food Worker'b''b'By Ben Austen'b''b''b'Adriana Alvarez'b' 'b'was'b' leaving her McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s at the end of a daylong shift in 2014 when a man stopped her in the parking lot. She\xe2\x80\x99d noticed him inside, buying coffee, and now he asked if she\xe2\x80\x99d heard about the Fight for $15. Laughing, she said $15 an hour for fast-food work sounded crazy. She was racing to pick up her son Manny from day care, but she talked with the guy later that evening. She told him that she earned $8.50 an hour, just 25 cents above the Illinois minimum wage. She\xe2\x80\x99d been at the same McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s in Cicero, a largely Latino town west of Chicago, for about four years. In all that time, she had one raise: 10 cents. The man explained that she\xe2\x80\x99d been cheated even out of her low pay: Workers at restaurants had been required, illegally, to punch out before tallying up their registers or breaking down French-fry boxes. \xe2\x80\x9cI think about it now,\xe2\x80\x9d Alvarez says. \xe2\x80\x9cGod, I was stupid.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A few weeks after meeting the organizer, Alvarez said, she and her co-workers handed in a petition demanding that the store manager show them more respect in front of customers. Not only did the yelling stop, she said, but they soon received a raise of as much as 75 cents. \xe2\x80\x9cPushing works,\xe2\x80\x9d Alvarez says she learned. In March 2014, she joined her first rally, a multicity coordinated Fight for $15 day of action.'b'Alvarez is now 24 and still works at the same McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s. Nationally, jobs in retail and food services outnumber those in manufacturing by more than two to one. The country\xe2\x80\x99s largest private employers include Walmart, McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s, Kroger and the conglomeration of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. These chains are no longer places just for teenagers to work part time: The average age of a fast-food employee has climbed to 29; like Alvarez, a third of them have spent some time in college.'b'Fight for $15 doesn\xe2\x80\x99t operate like a traditional union: There are no contracts with employers, and Alvarez and others pay no dues. The Service Employees International Union has been its primary source of funding from its inception in New York City, in 2012. Yet Fight for $15 organizers take credit for winning wage increases for 22 million workers in America. Although the federal minimum wage of $7.25 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t budged since 2009, numerous cities and states since 2012 have raised their base pay to $12, $13 and even $15 an hour. Under President Trump, the effort is sure to face additional hurdles. But Fight for $15 helped lead the campaign to derail Trump\xe2\x80\x99s first pick for labor secretary, Andrew Puzder, organizing workers from his fast-food chains to march on their stores and to share their stories of wage theft. Low pay is an issue that crosses party lines: Two of every five U.S. workers earn less than $15 an hour.'b'Today Alvarez makes $11 an hour at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s. She has never been put on the schedule for a full 40-hour week; she receives no benefits, health coverage or overtime. Yet the raise has allowed her to replace the moldering floorboards in her basement apartment. And Alvarez has been transformed in other ways by the labor fight. She has emerged as one of its spokeswomen, and the job has taken on a new significance. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen people say we should go back to school, I say the adjunct professors who joined us went to school,\xe2\x80\x9d Alvarez said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow come they\xe2\x80\x99re not doing better? I\xe2\x80\x99m not just serving customers. I\xe2\x80\x99m also serving these innocent ladies\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 her co-workers \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cwho might not be conscious of their rights.

Every year, for example, Culver has to undergo a Department of Transportation physical, because he has sleep apnea.'b'In recent years, online giants like Amazon have pushed for ever-faster delivery times, sometimes delivering orders on the same day. As consumers increase their online shopping \xe2\x80\x94 total retail sales in the United States increased only 2.9 percent last year, but online sales rose 15.1 percent \xe2\x80\x94 distribution networks have adapted by integrating more and more consumer destinations into their systems. Mark Merz, a spokesman for O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly, attributes part of the company\xe2\x80\x99s success to \xe2\x80\x9chaving inventory immediately available when a customer needs those parts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Though O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly extended its reach to 4,829 stores in 47 states last year and revenue surpassed $8.5 billion, that growth hasn\xe2\x80\x99t led to an expansion of its work force or changed the nature of its jobs. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve been short-staffed for over six months,\xe2\x80\x9d Culver says. \xe2\x80\x9cGuys are doing extra work and taking on extra stores for their routes.\xe2\x80\x9d Culver, who belongs to the Teamsters Local 120, says he is not paid by the amount of time it takes him to complete his deliveries but according to the route driven, which varies from year to year. Culver says he made roughly $53,000 last year, earning almost $23 an hour. \xe2\x80\x9cOur wages haven\xe2\x80\x99t really gone up in the same way that other jobs\xe2\x80\x99 wages have gone up,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to go to special school to get my license, and how we\xe2\x80\x99re treated and looked at hasn\xe2\x80\x99t really changed in 20 years.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Culver, who is 56, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t expect that technology will eliminate work like his. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t see how automatic truck drivers are going to work,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are so many variables.\xe2\x80\x9d O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly still needs people to operate the electric pallet jacks and hydraulic liftgates at the rear of their delivery trucks, still relies on backs and arms to unload and inspect orders. Despite the toll the work has taken on Culver \xe2\x80\x94 two operations to fuse vertebrae in his neck and a lower-back operation \xe2\x80\x94 he says he likes the job. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy doing this, I enjoy what I do,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI hope I can make it to 65.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Jaime Lowe is a freelance writer and a frequent contributor to the magazine.'b''b'Las Vegas \xe2\x80\xa2 The Customer-Service Rep'b''b'By Eric Steuer'b''b''b'When Sandi Dolan'b' moved to Las Vegas in 2014, to escape the cold Colorado winters, she\xe2\x80\x99d been working primarily as a customer-service representative for more than a decade in the insurance industry. Dolan is remarkably upbeat, and she says she genuinely enjoys helping strangers solve problems. But she said that day after day of calls about accidents and claims made for a pretty depressing gig. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one ever wants to talk to their insurance company,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s never a good phone call.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Not long after landing in Las Vegas, Dolan started looking for a job. She found a call-center opening with Zappos, the online shoe-and-apparel retailer. \xe2\x80\x9cI actually didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about the company,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut after I was hired, I started talking to locals, and people were like: \xe2\x80\x98You have no idea, do you? We all tried to get in there.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Zappos has more than 500 people on its customer-service team, about a third of the company\xe2\x80\x99s total staff. Most employees work together in the company\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters, a 10-story building downtown that used to be Las Vegas\xe2\x80\x99s city hall. Employees like Dolan, who work the phones, start at $14 an hour, about a dollar less than the median wage earned by the more than 2.5 million Americans who work as customer-service representatives. But Dolan, who makes slightly more than that, points out that, unlike at many other companies, most Zappos workers are full-time employees who receive benefits like health insurance and retirement plans.'b'At Zappos, employees are encouraged to interact with co-workers throughout the business and eat together on campus. The company frequently hosts events, ranging from product demonstrations to scavenger hunts, which are open to all employees. Dolan said this is one thing that makes her current work so much better than previous jobs. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been in places where I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even allowed to take a break with someone if they were a different pay grade than I was,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Another difference from Dolan\xe2\x80\x99s previous call-center jobs is that Zappos reps aren\xe2\x80\x99t limited in the amount of time they are allowed to spend on each conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cAt other jobs, I\xe2\x80\x99d be stressed because I\xe2\x80\x99d have to resolve each call in about five minutes in order to make my numbers,\xe2\x80\x9d Dolan said. She knows she could be making more money somewhere else, but she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t enjoy her day as much. \xe2\x80\x9cI figured I\xe2\x80\x99d do this for six months just to get something local on my r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 so I could look for something else,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked for a job since I stepped foot in here.

The bus travels 40 miles southwest to Washington Court House, population about 14,000, and drops its passengers near a plant owned by the SugarCreek Packing Company, which produces pork and poultry products like bacon bits and sausage patties. Just before 4, Sebatutsi, 40, changes into the uniform of a meat cutter: cap, gloves and scrubs. Then he takes his place in a line of men and women from Myanmar, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Bhutan and rural Ohio. Sebatutsi fled war in Congo as a teenager and spent most of his life in Rwanda\xe2\x80\x99s sprawling Gihembe refugee camp before being relocated to Ohio in 2015. Once the shift starts, he pushes meat through cutting machines. \xe2\x80\x9cYou push again and again,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me through a translator. \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t require a lot of knowledge.\xe2\x80\x9d There are three breaks per nine-hour shift: 15 minutes early on, a 30-minute meal break, then 10 minutes toward the end. At 1 a.m. he takes the bus home. When he arrives, his wife and children are sleeping. He works seven days a week, making $11.50 an hour, time and a half on Saturdays and double on Sundays. \xe2\x80\x9cI am so lucky,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'Central Ohio is particularly welcoming to refugees, having resettled more than 17,000 since 1983. In November 2016, the region became a flash point for those opposed to resettlement when a Somali-born Ohio State University student was killed by police after attacking pedestrians. Still, in early February, the Columbus mayor, Andrew Ginther, signed an executive order supporting the resettlement of refugees. His reasons were economic as well as altruistic. Nearly 12 percent of Columbus is foreign-born. According to a recent study from the New American Economy, a nonprofit research-and-advocacy group, Columbus-area immigrants pay $1.2 billion a year in taxes and have an annual spending power of $3.2 billion. They work as doctors and engineers, open small businesses employing thousands, perform manual labor in warehouses and frequently do the jobs that many other Americans will not, like meatpacking.'b'SugarCreek is one of many meatpacking businesses nationwide that have turned to refugees. Last spring, the company approached Community Refugee and Immigration Services (CRIS), a Columbus refugee- resettlement agency. \xe2\x80\x9cThey needed people,\xe2\x80\x9d said CRIS\xe2\x80\x99s Marcus Gorman, who arranges employment for the newly resettled. \xe2\x80\x9cThey had a lot of opportunities for entry-level workers, and they were accustomed to working with folks that spoke little to no English.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, Gorman said, about 65 of CRIS\xe2\x80\x99s clients work at SugarCreek. Since Sebatutsi started last November, he has opted to work every day, which he said is the best part of the job. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of overtime, and you can make money.\xe2\x80\x9d But, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s also the worst thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He is no longer able to join his family at church. All that pushing, slicing and packaging is repetitive, but it\xe2\x80\x99s far better than life in Gihembe. \xe2\x80\x9cThe kids can ask you for something, you cannot provide,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut here you work, you take care of your problems, you do something for yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Abe Streep is a contributing editor for Outside and a contributing writer for The California Sunday Magazine.'b''b'Dalton, Ga. \xe2\x80\xa2 The Carpet Whisperer'b''b'By Lizzie O\xe2\x80\x99Leary'b''b''b'The warehouse'b' where Guadalupe Guido works is so bright inside that it feels like noon no matter the time of day. Huge metal racks hold row after row of carpet that will be trucked from this plant in Dalton, Ga., all over the United States. Dalton calls itself the Carpet Capital of the World, and everyone in Guido\xe2\x80\x99s family \xe2\x80\x94 her mother, father, sister and herself \xe2\x80\x94 work for one of Dalton\xe2\x80\x99s carpet companies.'b'Guido, who is 23 and goes by Lupe, has been working at Engineered Floors for almost two years. She has risen quickly, starting on yarn machines, before driving a Hyster forklift, working as a production clerk and now serving as a tufting scheduler. She creates orders, dictating the type of yarn to use and how much footage of carpet each job will need. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout this person,\xe2\x80\x9d she said of her role, \xe2\x80\x9cthere really is no show.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the political sphere, manufacturing work is often associated with men, and specifically white men. But women have always worked in carpets in Dalton and at Engineered Floors. And Dalton is about 50 percent Latino, which is reflected in the work force here. Many people in the city came from Mexico in the 1970s and \xe2\x80\x9980s to work in the industry, including Guido\xe2\x80\x99s parents, Jose and Martina.'b'Lupe Guido was born in Dalton and dreamed initially of becoming a lawyer. \xe2\x80\x9cI talk a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a laugh. But at 18, she wanted independence and her own money and went to work at Mohawk Industries, one of the largest carpet companies in the city, where her mother still works. It was not what her parents had in mind. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I was growing up, it was always: \xe2\x80\x98Go to school, go to school,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be working how I\xe2\x80\x99m working.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But the carpet industry, like most of American manufacturing, has undergone radical changes. The hardest and most dangerous jobs are now performed by machines that are mostly run by computers, and those computers are watched over by people like Guido.'b'Engineered Floors is new in comparison to Mohawk or Shaw Industries, the two companies that have dominated Dalton for decades. But Guido has been able to move up quickly. She earns $15.50 an hour, up from $11 an hour when she started in 2015. At the end of each year, she gets a $500 bonus.'b'Guido said she would like to stay at Engineered Floors if she can. To do so requires vigilantly managing her time so that she can move up. She\xe2\x80\x99s awake at 6 a.m., clocks into her job at 7 and works a 10-hour shift until 5 p.m. After dinner with her fianc\xc3\xa9, who also works in the carpet industry, Guido spends her nights studying for a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree in human-resource management at Georgia Northwestern Technical College. One day, she wants to be a department manager or a plant manager. \xe2\x80\x9cThe way I\xe2\x80\x99ve been growing and growing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want for that to stop.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Lizzie O\xe2\x80\x99Leary is the host of the radio program \xe2\x80\x9cMarketplace Weekend.\xe2\x80\x9d More reporting by O\xe2\x80\x99Leary and the producer Eliza Mills about 'b'the carpet industry'b' in Dalton, Ga., is on Marketplace Weekend.'b''b'Las Vegas \xe2\x80\xa2 The Hotel Cleaner'b''b'By Amanda Fortini'b''b''b'Most mornings,'b' Wendy Almada \xe2\x80\x94 a guest-room attendant, or G.R.A., at the Aria Resort and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip \xe2\x80\x94 puts on a pair of latex gloves and tackles the bathroom first. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t like to do beds,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI like to clean bathrooms.\xe2\x80\x9d Next she yanks off the sheets, bags them and makes up the bed. She dusts, vacuums, empties the garbage. If a light bulb is out or the carpet needs to be shampooed, she puts in a work order. She scans the room for any last detail that she might have overlooked, then clocks out and moves on to the next one. She cleans 13 rooms a day, with suites counting as two or three.'b'Sometimes the job is that straightforward, but often she opens the door to find what all G.R.A.s dread: a \xe2\x80\x9ctrashed\xe2\x80\x9d room. \xe2\x80\x9cThey eat and they leave all the trash everywhere: cans, food,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, gesturing with her hands. She was seated at a folding table in a trailer parked in the lot of the Las Vegas Culinary Workers Union. \xe2\x80\x9cEspecially the bachelor party. Oh, my God, those are bad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Because she is a member of the union, the job pays her $17.65 an hour. The Culinary Workers Union Local 226, chartered in 1935, is the largest union in Nevada, representing 57,000 men and women from 167 countries (its membership is 56 percent Latino and 81 percent people of color), among them cooks, bartenders, cocktail servers, porters, bellmen and guest-room attendants. The average wage of a culinary-union worker is $23 an hour, compared with the $10 an hour made by a nonunionized Las Vegas hospitality worker or the $6 an hour Almada, who is 42 and who moved to the United States from the Mexico border town of Agua Prieta (she got her green card when she was 11, and became a citizen when she was 22), was paid at her last job in a coffee-cup-making factory in Tucson.'b'She said she was fired from that job for taking two months\xe2\x80\x99 maternity leave, which prompted her and her (now former) husband to move to Las Vegas. They had heard that there were jobs at the casinos, where 90 percent of the hospitality work force on the Strip belong to the culinary union. But it was only after they divorced and she needed to support herself and her three children that Almada applied for her job at the Aria.'b'That was six years ago. Almada enumerates all the ways that the job and its attendant union membership has improved her life: free health insurance and pharmacy benefits; a pension; job security; and soon a $20,000 down payment she will use to buy her first house. Initially she didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the benefits and regulations the union conferred. This is a common reason workers can still be taken advantage of, particularly those who don\xe2\x80\x99t speak English. For the past seven months, though, Almada has been on an extended, contractually allowed, union-sanctioned leave of absence to serve as an organizer at Mandalay Bay Casino; she is teaching other workers to read and understand their own contracts. \xe2\x80\x9cI never had these rights in Arizona,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I had my little one, they fired me and nobody helped me.

While serving a three-year sentence, he resolved that he would change his fate.'b'With the help of a former prosecutor who took an interest in his rehabilitation, Awan found his way into Operation Exit, a program founded in 2014 in which the city of Boston partners with unions to channel residents with criminal backgrounds into the trades. Having sampled carpentry, sheet-metal work and other options, Awan, who had always been fascinated by welding but doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like heights, chose pipe fitting over iron work.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s plenty of politics in the building trades, but there\xe2\x80\x99s also an ethos of craft meritocracy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not what you look like, it\xe2\x80\x99s what your clevis hangers look like,\xe2\x80\x9d Awan said, referring to the brackets used to support pipes. \xe2\x80\x9cAll at the same level, nothing crooked. It\xe2\x80\x99s about your work ethic.\xe2\x80\x9d He\xe2\x80\x99s already planning to get his 5-year-old son into the local when he\xe2\x80\x99s old enough.'b'Awan, who is 28 and currently a second-year apprentice making $30 an hour plus benefits, can become a journeyman in three years, and he looks forward to continuing up the scale of seniority and pay toward the top rate of $50 or so an hour. He still lives near the Four Corners section of Dorchester where he grew up, but he\xe2\x80\x99s shopping for a house outside the city. \xe2\x80\x9cYou come from no money for food, nothing, to where you\xe2\x80\x99re buying a house, buying a car,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYour son needs a school uniform, you can get him one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Boston\xe2\x80\x99s mayor, Martin Walsh, intends Operation Exit to enable this kind of transformation of prospects and consciousness. Walsh, who also grew up in Dorchester and had his own troubles (a bullet grazed his leg) before putting his life on course in the building trades, says: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve had 80 graduates come through this program, and we\xe2\x80\x99re expanding from the building trades into coding and culinary arts. Some of these guys were impact players on the street. It has an effect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Programs that reduce crime by connecting offenders and potential offenders to meaningful work are getting more attention across the country. Some, like Operation Exit, focus on re-entry after prison; others, like the Chicago CRED initiative recently started by the Emerson Collective and Arne Duncan, the former U.S. secretary of education, try to reduce gun violence by teaching job and life skills to young men adrift from both school and the labor market. It takes a significant investment of time and resources to shift a life from a dead-end trajectory to a viable future in this way, but Awan testifies to the approach\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m no surgeon or big-time prosecutor,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut for me \xe2\x80\x94 a product of his environment, taken from my mother at 9, incarcerated at 18, sweeping and mopping in the hole in prison for 19 cents an hour, living like a peasant \xe2\x80\x94 this here is a lottery ticket.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Carlo Rotella is the director of American studies at Boston College and the author, most recently, of \xe2\x80\x9cPlaying in Time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''b''b''b'I'b'n Philadelphia, before the first game of the N.B.A. season, Russell Westbrook worked through his warm-up routine. He was loose and laughing but \xe2\x80\x94 as always \xe2\x80\x94 precise. Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s internal clock had driven him to be the first player out on the court, a full three hours before tipoff, and he was performing his routine in front of a largely empty arena. He started with chip-ins and free throws, easy stuff to get his body going, and then moved on to his signature shot: the pull-up jumper. Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s pull-up is one of modern basketball\xe2\x80\x99s most recognizable weapons \xe2\x80\x94 if not yet quite on the level of Kareem\xe2\x80\x99s skyhook or Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s turnaround or Dirk\xe2\x80\x99s one-legged fadeaway, then at least at the edge of that territory. The move is a surprise attack. Westbrook is unreasonably fast and aggressive, a flying, screaming whirlwind of ferocious highlight dunks, and he charges the hoop with so much raging menace that defenders have no choice but to scramble backward to try to stop him. That\xe2\x80\x99s when he hits them with the pull-up: He stops instantly and \xe2\x80\x94 while the defender\xe2\x80\x99s momentum continues to drag him backward \xe2\x80\x94 leaps perfectly straight into the air, like a fighter pilot ejecting from his cockpit to escape an explosion, except that Russell Westbrook 'b'is'b' the explosion: He is the explosion and the control all at once. The whole thing seems to defy the laws of motion. Growing up in Los Angeles, Westbrook practiced this move so many tens of thousands of times on the playground that he and his father referred to it as \xe2\x80\x9cthe cotton shot,\xe2\x80\x9d because they always expected it to go through the net.'b'Now, in Philadelphia, in front of the ushers and ball boys, Westbrook practiced his cotton shot. He backed up almost to half-court, squared his huge shoulders, dipped, charged, stopped, rose, fired \xe2\x80\x94 and missed. He backed up and tried again. Again he missed.'b'It was only warm-ups, but everything surrounding Westbrook in that moment seemed historic, and the misses struck me as a bad sign. I watched him shoot 11 times from the same spot and make only three. At one point, he missed five in a row. Russell Westbrook was cold. The cotton shot, at a very inconvenient moment, seemed to have turned to iron.'b'As season openers go, this game was unusually loaded with expectations. It was a sort of Independence Day: the first game of Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s professional career without Kevin Durant as his teammate. For eight seasons, Westbrook and Durant were one of the great inscrutable duos in all of sports, superstars with wildly opposing personalities and playing styles, overachieving together in Oklahoma City, one of the smallest markets in the N.B.A. Durant was basketball\xe2\x80\x99s greatest prodigy since LeBron James, a mild-mannered, long-limbed scoring genius with a baby face and a golden jump shot. Westbrook was the scowling underdog on a never-ending mission to prove the entire universe wrong.'b'On the scale of creative tension, Westbrook-Durant fell somewhere between Lennon-McCartney and Goofus-Gallant. They clashed and blended, encouraged and diminished one another, in ways that were hard to parse. Durant led the league in scoring; Westbrook led the league in turnovers. Durant was the metronome; Westbrook the guitar solo. Durant was the scenic cliff; Westbrook the waterfall raging primally over the top of it. Occasionally, TV cameras would catch the two of them squabbling during a timeout, but they always appeared at the media table together afterward to insist that they were friends and brothers. Durant once called Westbrook his \xe2\x80\x9chype man\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the Flavor Flav to his Chuck D. The whole relationship was a puzzle. Were they real friends, work friends, secret rivals, frenemies, secret real-world frenemies? On sports TV, Westbrook and Durant inspired as much talking-head bloviation as a celebrity affair.'b'The most surprising thing about the partnership, however, was how well it worked. Westbrook and Durant turned the Oklahoma City Thunder, against all odds, into one of the reigning powers in the N.B.A. In 2012, when both stars were still only 23 \xe2\x80\x94 an age at which most players are just beginning to find their footing \xe2\x80\x94 the Thunder made it all the way to the finals. In a six-year span, they reached the Western Conference finals four times. (It took major injuries to keep them out.) The only thing Durant and Westbrook never did together was win a championship. They came agonizingly close, including last season, when they held a 3-1 lead in the playoffs against the mighty Golden State Warriors. But they never could quite push over the top. Still, it seemed inevitable that their day would eventually come.'b'Until last July, when Durant blew everyone\xe2\x80\x99s minds by leaving Westbrook, suddenly and gracelessly, to join the aforementioned Warriors, making their superteam even more super. Just like that, Westbrook was on his own. The hype man was out front. And anyone who knew anything about basketball was dying to see what would happen next. It seemed less like a question of sports than a Zen koan: What is the sound of one hand clapping?'b'If anyone could answer that, could explore its full range of sonic possibilities, it was Russell Westbrook. The sound might be wonderful or terrible, or wonderfully terrible, or it might be nothing at all. The only certainty was that we were all about to hear it, at maximum volume, for an entire season.'b''b'That night in 'b'Philadelphia, Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s poor warm-up shooting carried over into the game, not only for himself but also for his teammates. He was setting players up for easy shots \xe2\x80\x94 layups and open threes \xe2\x80\x94 but they kept blowing them. When Westbrook tried on his own, his luck was no better. He missed tough contested jumpers, drove into crowds of defenders and was blocked, forced passes and threw the ball away. The 76ers were widely expected to be the worst team in the league this season, but after five minutes they led the Thunder 16-5. The Philadelphia crowd was going crazy.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe scared!\xe2\x80\x9d the people behind me kept screaming.'b'This storm of negativity triggered one of those Westbrook moments when he seems to pop out of space-time. Off a Sixers turnover, Westbrook took the ball near half-court, charged toward the rim, drew a hard foul and still somehow exploded forward, twisting between two defenders, to toss in a layup from a steep angle. He stood there for a second after the whistle, berating the crowd. A courtside fan \xe2\x80\x94 a bespectacled white man in a bulging Allen Iverson jersey \xe2\x80\x94 screamed back at Westbrook and flipped him off with both hands.'b'Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s face, in happy moments, is smooth and boyish, with deep dimples and a classic beauty mark on his cheek; his facial hair grows in tiny sparse wisps that suggest an eighth grader who hasn\xe2\x80\x99t yet learned how to shave. (Westbrook claims that he has never actually shaved.) But now his sweet face changed. The bright, round eyes narrowed and darkened; the lips twisted into a sneer. Westbrook, when he needs it, has weapons-grade powers of stinkface, and he unleashed their full nuclear payload on the fan. He pointed him out to the referees in disgusted disbelief. Security came to escort the man away. Westbrook was still shaking his head in fury as he stepped up to make the free throw, and on the next few possessions he seemed lit up by anger, driving and passing and scoring so relentlessly that the fans behind me stopped taunting him and grew quiet, then started complaining about the man in the Iverson jersey, asking why the hell he had thought it was a good idea to antagonize Westbrook in the first place. Animated by rage, Westbrook carried his team, and by halftime the score was tied. Westbrook walked off the floor cursing fiercely.'b'The second half brought plenty more to be angry about. No one but Westbrook could create anything, and no one could finish the things he created. After OKC\xe2\x80\x99s center, Steven Adams, managed to miss an easy alley-oop Westbrook had set him up for, the crowd started chanting: \xe2\x80\x9cK.D. LEFT YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d ('b'clap, clap, clap-clap-clap'b') \xe2\x80\x9cK.D. LEFT YOU!\xe2\x80\x9d So Westbrook started shooting, and \xe2\x80\x94 just as he had in warm-ups \xe2\x80\x94 he missed and he missed, but still he didn\xe2\x80\x99t stop. At all times, Westbrook surfs right on the perilous line between confidence and recklessness, and tonight he was surfing and wiping out hard, only to get back up and immediately wipe out again.'b'With just under three minutes left and the Thunder trailing by 3 points, Westbrook dribbled hard at the basket and, without any apparent shadow of self-doubt, stopped to rise for a pull-up jumper \xe2\x80\x94 precisely the shot I had watched him clank so many times before the game. Now, however, he made it, and then with around a minute left he did it again, giving the Thunder the lead, and in the end, as the crowd gurgled on its own disappointment, the Thunder won by 6 points. Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s final stat line was dangerously overstuffed: 32 points, 12 rebounds, nine assists. He should probably have had closer to 15 assists, but that stat depends largely on the skill of the players around you, and with this group, nine seemed like a minor miracle.'b'After the game, Westbrook sat at his locker wearing only a towel, with the veins bulging out of his legs so hard he looked like a map of the human circulatory system. (Joe Sharpe, the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s head trainer, told me that Westbrook could probably be a bodybuilder if he wanted to.) Slowly, while the media watched in silence, Westbrook started getting dressed. He put on underwear covered with the words \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Not?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s personal slogan, which he invokes to justify everything from his fashion choices to his shot selection. (As he tweeted once, apropos of nothing: \xe2\x80\x9cWHYNOT?!!! #whynot #whynot\xe2\x80\x9d) He pulled on a pair of skinny black jeans, ripped at the knees, then a bright yellow sweatshirt that said, on the front, \xe2\x80\x9cParanormal: Out of the Ordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d Over this he put on a denim jacket.'b'It was, I thought, an interesting outfit.'b'But there was one more piece, and it was the coup de gr\xc3\xa2ce: Over his jeans, Westbrook pulled on a kilt.'b'He rubbed some Vaseline on his face and turned to face the media for an official round of questions. As usual, he spoke to the reporters without ever looking at them. It was as if he were being interviewed by the locker-room door, with which he maintained fierce eye contact, with occasional follow-up questions from the ceiling tiles or the carpet.'b'Why are you wearing a kilt? someone asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook said.'b'And so began life after Kevin Durant.'b''b'Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s season has'b' a chance to be historic because of one magical statistic: the triple-double. A triple-double means, simply, that a player has reached double figures in three major categories during the course of a game \xe2\x80\x94 almost always points, rebounds and assists. If that sounds like dry math, it is not. In the N.B.A., the triple-double is a sacred threshold of excellence.'b'Triple-doubles are difficult and rare. You don\xe2\x80\x99t stumble into one \xe2\x80\x94 it takes a special kind of player, a dominant generalist. Even the outliers capable of achieving them tend to get only a handful per year; Magic Johnson, the modern king of the stat, got 18 in his best season. A triple-double is not a statistical parlor trick, like hitting for the cycle in baseball. It actually captures the essence of basketball, the way the game allows every player to do everything on the floor whenever the opportunity arises. To get a triple-double, a player has to control the action physically, strategically and socially; he has to become a funnel through which the energy of an entire game pours.'b'Westbrook has always had the potential to ring up triple-doubles, and in past seasons he has put together impressive flurries of them. This season, he has gone bananas. Some games, it feels as if Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s stats are moving in fast-forward \xe2\x80\x94 as if he is pulling numbers out of wormholes that only he can access. One night, Westbrook generated 10 assists in only 15 minutes; another, he finished with 26 points, 11 rebounds and 22 assists \xe2\x80\x94 totals not seen since Johnson himself. For years, the popular narrative stressed how much Durant was sacrificing to fit in next to Westbrook. It has become clear that the opposite was certainly just as true.'b'Westbrook is now playing against history. The Holy Grail of triple-doubling is not just to pile up a ridiculous number of them but to actually 'b'average'b' a triple-double for an entire season. This has only happened once, in 1961-62, when Oscar Robertson averaged 30.8 points, 12.5 rebounds, and 11.4 assists \xe2\x80\x94 numbers straight from the mouth of God. Until recently, his feat seemed as untouchable as DiMaggio\xe2\x80\x99s 56-game hitting streak or Wilt\xe2\x80\x99s 100-point game. Matching Robertson\xe2\x80\x99s record is doubly tricky because not only was he an aberrant superfreak, he also happened to play in an unusually fast era, when teams flew up and down the court generating extra possessions in which to rack up gaudy statistics. Today\xe2\x80\x99s players are limited by the modern game\xe2\x80\x99s slow pace. Even LeBron James, the greatest player of his generation and someone whose gifts seem precision-engineered to produce triple-doubles \xe2\x80\x94 size for rebounding, vision for assists, speed and agility for scoring \xe2\x80\x94 has never come close to averaging one for an entire season. That\xe2\x80\x99s how basketball works: There are unavoidable trade-offs, pragmatic allocations of resources. Averaging a triple-double is like having a helicopter that is also a boat that can also write the Great American Novel. It is more than just an engineering impossibility \xe2\x80\x94 it is an existential cheat.'b'When Durant left last summer, some fans speculated that Westbrook might have a chance to pull this madness off. Rational people, myself included, responded with scornful laughter. It was absurd, particularly for a player who was only 6-foot-3 and surrounded by mediocre shooters. To actually average a triple-double would be not only historic and impressive but also a little weird, almost disturbing.'b'But this is where we have to take into account Russell Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s personality.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a different dude,\xe2\x80\x9d Anthony Morrow, a Thunder shooting guard, told me.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s weird, yeah,\xe2\x80\x9d Steven Adams said. He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cBizarre.\xe2\x80\x9d He paused again. \xe2\x80\x9cNot normal.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Westbrook is not merely a superelite athlete (he is commonly referred to as the most athletic player in the N.B.A.); he also has a highly unusual mind. He is moody, stubborn, loyal and fiercely private, a control freak and a perfectionist. Outside a very small circle of family and friends, he refuses to be known. The triple-doubles, their sheer unreasonableness, are as much a reflection of this personality as of any particular basketball skills. Each time he registers one it is like a signal \xe2\x80\x94 a ping from the sealed box of his private mind.'b''b'Russell Westbrook III'b' grew up 1,300 miles from Oklahoma City, in Los Angeles. He was born in 1988, under the smiling moon of Magic Johnson. Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s father, Russell Westbrook Jr., worked at a bread factory and played basketball in his free time on the local playgrounds. When I asked Westbrook III what kind of player his dad was, he burst into laughter.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPlayer?\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cPlayer!?\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if he had never thought of his father that way before. \xe2\x80\x9cMan, they argued the whole time,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I remember most. They played for five minutes and argued for 40 minutes. All day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s father was strict and devoted, determined above all to keep his family out of the way of trouble. When Westbrook showed an interest in basketball, his father devised endless drills that they ran through, just the two of them, for hours at a time. They focused on the midrange jumper, the cotton shot, practicing it off one foot and two feet, on the move and standing still. Westbrook learned to identify all the possible ways you can mess the shot up: being off balance, moving too fast, not having your feet set. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of times, I make it when those things are not right,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all my dad. That\xe2\x80\x99s all him and myself, basically.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Westbrook constantly invokes his family \xe2\x80\x94 his parents, his brother, his wife \xe2\x80\x94 to explain why he is the way he is, but he won\xe2\x80\x99t allow reporters to talk to them. When I asked if I could speak with his father or brother, he told me he would ask his mother instead \xe2\x80\x94 and then added, immediately: \xe2\x80\x9cMy mom never talks. She never talks. She doesn\xe2\x80\x99t like to talk.\xe2\x80\x9d (I never spoke with her.)'b'As a high school player, Westbrook was spectacularly unheralded. He was the shortest kid on his team, not even able to dunk until his senior year. Although he already possessed most of the qualities that would eventually make him great \xe2\x80\x94 the crazy speed and fearlessness, the motor that never stopped \xe2\x80\x94 basketball was fundamentally a game of size, and Westbrook didn\xe2\x80\x99t have it. A lifetime of arguing on playgrounds looked as if it might be his best case.'b'Then came a miraculous growth spurt. Toward the end of high school, Westbrook shot up seven inches, from 5-foot-8 to 6-foot-3. Suddenly, all his intangible gifts were attached to formidable size. Westbrook was still not an elite recruit \xe2\x80\x94 it was too late for that \xe2\x80\x94 but he was good enough to earn a last-minute scholarship to U.C.L.A. after one of its star players declared unexpectedly for the N.B.A. draft. Westbrook was a bench player, a defensive specialist; his job was to enter the game and wreak havoc. During his freshman year, he averaged only nine minutes and 3 points a game. That same year, at the University of Texas, the freshman Kevin Durant was playing 36 minutes a game and averaging 26 points and 11 rebounds \xe2\x80\x94 by many reckonings, the greatest freshman year in N.C.A.A. basketball history.'b'During his sophomore year, Westbrook played more of a central role at U.C.L.A., and his powerful dunks made him a hero of ESPN highlight reels. Still, no one was in danger of confusing him with Kevin Durant, who was by then winning N.B.A. Rookie of the Year. Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s second-year averages remained relatively modest \xe2\x80\x94 13 points, four assists, four rebounds \xe2\x80\x94 but it was enough to entice the Seattle SuperSonics (soon to be, scandalously, the Oklahoma City Thunder) to take him in the 2008 N.B.A. draft. They picked him fourth, a position almost everyone else thought was a serious reach. As a Seattle Times columnist put it the day after the draft: \xe2\x80\x9cEquipped with two first-round picks, they came away with Westbrook and Serge Ibaka. That\xe2\x80\x99s like getting two free airline tickets and booking trips to Gary, Ind., and Kosovo.\xe2\x80\x9d No one was more surprised on draft night than Westbrook himself, who was afraid he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to be picked at all. \xe2\x80\x9cI was like: Damn, am I gonna be the only one left in the greenroom?\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is about to be embarrassing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In theory, in the beginning, Westbrook and Durant seemed like a perfectly complementary pair: the scrappy defensive specialist next to the once-in-a-generation scorer. Westbrook could defer to Durant on offense and cover his shortcomings on defense. Instead, Westbrook took over the team.'b'He had few of the skills that defined a traditional point guard: panoramic vision, flawless ball-handling, a deadly outside shot. But his personality was more suited to leading than Durant\xe2\x80\x99s was. This, in fact, was a major part of why the team drafted Westbrook, for his unique psychological profile: his ability to withstand crushing stress and pressure and doubt without losing confidence or focus. Many of Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s elite skills were mental, and he would need them right away. The Thunder started his rookie season 3-29, and there were serious debates about whether they were the worst team ever. Westbrook led the league in turnovers, and the team\xe2\x80\x99s ownership was widely reviled for stealing the franchise from Seattle. Even when the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes changed the following season, when they made the playoffs and almost beat the world-champion Lakers, and then the following season, when Westbrook averaged 22 points a game and became an All-Star and the team made it all the way to the Western Conference finals \xe2\x80\x94 even then, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly easy. A narrative was beginning to develop: Westbrook was a volatile, reckless ball hog, an inferior player who refused to defer to the clearly superior Durant.'b''b'Mo Cheeks is 'b'the Russell Westbrook whisperer. Cheeks was a legendary 1980s point guard for the 76ers, an unheralded prospect who turned himself, through the power of scrappiness, into a recurrent All-Star and an N.B.A. champion, the point guard for Dr. J and Moses Malone and Charles Barkley. Cheeks joined the Thunder as an assistant coach in Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s second year, and Westbrook has been his special assignment ever since.'b'Early on, Cheeks and other coaches bullied Westbrook around the floor while he dribbled to improve his ball-handling. When Westbrook had emotional outbursts in the middle of games, Cheeks was the one to talk him down. They still work together early every morning: Westbrook is always the first player to the gym, hours before practice starts, and he will pull Cheeks out of the morning coaches\xe2\x80\x99 meeting so they can run through shooting and post moves.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a driven man,\xe2\x80\x9d Cheeks told me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a very disciplined person. Never late, always on time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked Cheeks if he\xe2\x80\x99d ever been around a player like Westbrook.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI \xe2\x80\x94 I \xe2\x80\x94 I don\xe2\x80\x99t know many with that explosiveness,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe power and the speed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What about Barkley? Or Allen Iverson?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCharles was powerful, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the speed of this guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Cheeks said. \xe2\x80\x9cIverson\xe2\x80\x99s a good name. He played like that \xe2\x80\x94 that same ferociousness, same competitive drive.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But Iverson, infamously, was not a fan of practice, and Westbrook treats every practice as if it\xe2\x80\x99s Game 7 of a playoff series. This is something that surprised Billy Donovan, the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s head coach, when he joined the organization last season. Even at the beginning of a morning walk-through, when the coaches were just trying to get everyone loosened up, Westbrook would take his first touch of the ball and explode as if he\xe2\x80\x99d been shot out of a cannon to throw down a tomahawk dunk. He is like this always. \xe2\x80\x9cWe play 82 games,\xe2\x80\x9d Donovan said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are gonna be nights when your team just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have it. Four games in five nights, you\xe2\x80\x99re tired, you\xe2\x80\x99re beaten down, it\xe2\x80\x99s a long trip, there\xe2\x80\x99s flight issues. Russell is so unique that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t happen to him. It\xe2\x80\x99s nuts.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my 39th year,\xe2\x80\x9d Cheeks said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve asked many people, and no one really has had an explanation for this guy. This guy plays with power and speed all the time. Like, all the time. This is kind of a \xe2\x80\x98cool\xe2\x80\x99 league. You don\xe2\x80\x99t play like that all the time. He does it 'b'all'b' the time. Practice. Preseason games. A lot of guys make the All-Star team, but how many have been two-time All-Star M.V.P.?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The answer is: Several, but only Russell Westbrook has been unreasonable enough to do it in consecutive years. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think I\xe2\x80\x99m good enough to relax and be cool,\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook told me. \xe2\x80\x9cJust be chillin\xe2\x80\x99 and be cool.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked Semaj Christon, one of the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s backup point guards, what it was like to guard Westbrook in practice every day.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a problem,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not fun,\xe2\x80\x9d Anthony Morrow told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI done seen him literally hurt people, on offense, and it\xe2\x80\x99s not an offensive foul.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the swirling cloud of contradiction that surrounds Westbrook, one paradox stands out. He often looks, on the court, like a force of pure chaos: a wild, petulant, fire-breathing hothead. And yet he is also, especially in his personal life, relentlessly devoted to order and control. He builds his days around a series of inflexible routines: calls to his parents, a designated parking spot, morning shooting on Court 3. He expects every room to be neat and clean, at work and at home.'b'Before games, Westbrook always eats a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich, and it must be prepared just so: bread cut on a diagonal, fillings spread very thin. (In Oklahoma, the team chefs know exactly how to do it, but on the road Westbrook can\xe2\x80\x99t trust anyone, so he makes it himself.) Three hours before tipoff, Westbrook warms up; at T-minus-60 minutes he goes to chapel. When the pregame countdown clock hits precisely 6:17 \xe2\x80\x94 never a second more or less \xe2\x80\x94 Westbrook leaps off the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s bench and screams, \xe2\x80\x9cTwo lines,\xe2\x80\x9d initiating the team\xe2\x80\x99s final layup drill. I asked Westbrook if there was some kind of numerology behind this \xe2\x80\x94 a June 17 birthday, a favorite Bible verse. \xe2\x80\x9cNo particular reason,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI just do it. Nothing special.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Westbrook is unbelievably attuned to the tiniest details of his shoes. He has his own personal rack at the practice facility. \xe2\x80\x9cMost guys, I can just bring a pair of shoes,\xe2\x80\x9d the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s equipment manager, Wilson Taylor, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cRussell wants a certain pair. He knows which are for games, which are for practice. He determines which shoes are coming on a road trip.\xe2\x80\x9d When Nike sent Westbrook its latest model, the Jordan 31, he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t happy with the sole flexibility, so he asked the company to build him a special hybrid using the previous model\xe2\x80\x99s sole. Even in that custom shoe, however, the insoles aren\xe2\x80\x99t thick enough for Westbrook, so Taylor replaces each of them by hand.'b'On the court, what looks like madness is often deliberate. Westbrook is obsessive about studying film. He insists on knowing every play from every position. Steven Adams told me that Westbrook occasionally wakes him up in the middle of the night, on the team plane, to show him an angle he might have missed. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t gonna lie, bud,\xe2\x80\x9d Adams said. \xe2\x80\x9cWatching video, especially after a game, at like 2 in the morning \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s rather hard to stay up. He maintains the same focus. It\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Everyone had stories like these. I got the feeling that Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s personality, the sheer intensity of his presence, is an energy field that seeps into every square centimeter of the Thunder organization. When Westbrook is around, everyone is aware of him, and he is never not around. Players arrive at the gym in the morning to find Westbrook already there. Sometimes they come in at night to put up extra shots, and Westbrook will already be there again, in the weight room, working out. You can begin to imagine how Kevin Durant, a talent with equal or greater claim to the organization but not nearly Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s force of personality, might have been driven to look for his own space elsewhere.'b'Although everyone who works with Westbrook gushes about him endlessly \xe2\x80\x94 he is loyal and generous and as real as a human could ever possibly be, they say \xe2\x80\x94 he also has a talent for keeping the people around him slightly on edge. He has a foulmouthed, teasing charm, and a formidableness that makes people think twice, and often a third and fourth time, before mentioning something they\xe2\x80\x99re not sure he\xe2\x80\x99ll like. Perhaps this tension is another way Westbrook has found to maintain focus, in himself and in others \xe2\x80\x94 the social equivalent of grinding a blade across a rough stone to keep it sharp.'b''b'I first met'b' Westbrook while writing an article for this magazine in 2012, and we did not exactly hit it off. He kept me waiting for over an hour for an interview that was spectacularly unproductive; despite my best efforts to keep our conversation going, it petered out in less than 10 minutes, some of which time Westbrook actually spent on the phone telling a friend that he was currently doing an interview but would be done with it very soon. It felt almost as if he were performing some kind of art project.'b'He shut down questions with ruthless efficiency. The P.R. staff had mentioned to me that Westbrook was famous in the organization for giving everyone nicknames: Alfalfa, Ace Ventura, Snakes on a Plane. I asked him what nicknames he\xe2\x80\x99d given his teammates.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose are my secrets,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t let out secrets.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The most revealing thing took place afterward, when Westbrook went into the P.R. office to banter with the staff. He sat down to look over a stack of contracts. (Westbrook handles most of his own business; he often sits in the back of the practice facility to pay his bills.) He admired a new addition to the room \xe2\x80\x94 a big, free-standing, color-coded season schedule \xe2\x80\x94 and asked the P.R. guys if he could have it. They said no, they were using it to plan the season, but they would be happy to get another one printed out especially for him. Westbrook asked why he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t just take this one right now, and then they could get another schedule printed for themselves. That way he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have to wait. He was the player, he said. Shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t he have priority?'b'Even in the middle of the P.R. office, in other words, Westbrook was having a P.R. problem. He was being a jerk. Watching this performance in person, however, even immediately after my unsuccessful interview, I could see why everyone liked him anyway. Westbrook wasn\xe2\x80\x99t only a jerk, or at least not uncomplicatedly a jerk. By traditional social standards, saying the things Westbrook was saying is bad manners. But that\xe2\x80\x99s in the same way that, by traditional basketball standards, it\xe2\x80\x99s a bad idea to charge into a one-on-four fast break and pull up for a contested free-throw-line jumper. He was a social gambler as well as a basketball gambler, one of those people who know how to play on the line between charisma and rudeness, teasing and affection, especially among people he likes.'b'Westbrook started to sign his stack of documents. He held the pen in his left hand.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLittle-known fact about Russell,\xe2\x80\x9d one of the P.R. guys said to me. \xe2\x80\x9cHe shoots with his right hand, it says he\xe2\x80\x99s right-handed in the media guide, but he writes with his left.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s head snapped up. He looked straight at me, where I was leaning against the door frame.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t put that in your article,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'I told him we could make a deal: I would keep it out of my article if he would tell me one of his teammates\xe2\x80\x99 nicknames.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t get to bargain with me,\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook said \xe2\x80\x94 and then he added a curse word with so much venom it made me laugh out loud. He went back to signing papers with his left hand.'b''b'A month into'b' the 2016 season, Westbrook arrived in New York agonizingly close to the impossible Oscar Robertson dream: averaging a triple-double. The only stat holding him back was rebounding. He was at 9.9 per game \xe2\x80\x94 an extremely high number, historic in itself for a point guard of his size, frankly a little unrealistic. But still: single digits. The statisticians had crunched and crunched and determined that at Madison Square Garden that night, Westbrook would need to pull down 11 rebounds in order to get his average up to 10.'b'Rebounding has always been one of Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s superpowers. He is athletic enough to leap through vast spaces, strong enough to bully people in close combat and, most important, persistent enough to get himself, with unholy urgency, to the places around the rim most likely to yield rebounds. I have seen Westbrook streak in from a distant corner of the floor to tip in a missed 3-pointer off the glass \xe2\x80\x94 a hurtling, perfectly timed run that looked almost like a center fielder\xe2\x80\x99s sprinting back to leap and steal a home run just as it cleared the wall.'b'In the end, every rebound comes down to one small coordinate somewhere near the basket: a grapefruit of space that materializes suddenly, unpredictably, and then disappears in a second, almost like the golden snitch in quidditch. Westbrook is frighteningly good at getting to that elusive point before anyone else, almost regardless of his starting position, and making it his own. He owns the grapefruit of space.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome of these rebounds over power forwards and centers \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s will,\xe2\x80\x9d Morrow told me. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see it in his eyes. It\xe2\x80\x99s just a level of focus and will that I have never seen before. Never. Nobody. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been around a lot of focused dudes, but to be consistently like that \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s crazy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At Madison Square Garden, Westbrook needed 11 rebounds to cross the sacred threshold, and started with the Knicks\xe2\x80\x99 first shot: It came off the back of the rim, and Westbrook casually took it out of the air with his left hand. Three minutes later, a 3-pointer rattled in and out and popped directly into Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s hands. The ball seemed to seek him out, over and over, and when it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, he was perfectly willing to go out of his way to get it. In the second quarter, Westbrook rained down a storm of stats on the Knicks that included a series of crucial and difficult rebounds, several of which looked even more impressive because they came at the expense of Kristaps Porzingis, New York\xe2\x80\x99s gigantic young center, who at 7-foot-3 is a full foot taller than Westbrook. Twice, Porzingis blocked Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s shot only to see Westbrook end up with the ball; another time, Westbrook sprang off both feet and violently snatched a rebound out of Porzingis\xe2\x80\x99s very high hands.'b'By the end of the first half, Westbrook had already collected nine rebounds and was on the brink of a triple-double, which Knicks fans were openly cheering for him to get. The triple-double arrived 79 seconds into the second half, at which point the journalists around me started tweeting furiously that, at only 20 minutes of game action, it was the fastest triple-double of the modern era \xe2\x80\x94 until the Thunder P.R. staff pointed out that, as a matter of fact, Westbrook did one the previous year in under 18 minutes. (Westbrook now holds the second-, third- and fourth-fastest triple-doubles in N.B.A. history.)'b'Even with his triple-double secured, Westbrook would not stop rebounding. My favorite of the night was his 14th: he drove, drew three defenders, passed to a teammate for a wide-open jump shot and ended up deep out of bounds. Instead of just hanging out there, admiring his handiwork, Westbrook turned, tracked the shot with his eyes, saw that it was falling short and, at precisely the moment the ball hit the front of the rim, exploded into the air with shocking intensity. It did not look like a normal professional basketball player trying to get his hand on a ball to extend a possession late in the third quarter of the 19th game of the season. It looked like a man in the middle of a winner-takes-all dunk contest against the Devil himself to prevent the incineration of planet Earth. It looked as if Westbrook were insulted by the very concept of distance, and so he annihilated it, soaring and spearing the ball out of the air from between two waiting Knicks. Spike Lee, courtside, was standing to celebrate the initial missed shot, but when Westbrook came flying in to seize it, he clutched his head in exasperation and hopelessness and despair.'b'By the time the game ended, Westbrook had 27 points, 14 assists and 17 rebounds \xe2\x80\x94 far more than he needed. He was officially averaging a triple-double, and then some.'b'This came in the middle of what would turn out to be a streak of seven straight games with triple-doubles \xe2\x80\x94 a feat so outrageous it was last done by Michael Jordan in 1989. Westbrook and his numbers became a leaguewide spectacle. A few weeks later, after hundreds of questions about it, Westbrook expressed annoyance at the whole phenomenon.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHonestly, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he told reporters, \xe2\x80\x9cthis triple-double thing is kind of getting on my nerves. People think if I don\xe2\x80\x99t get it, it\xe2\x80\x99s like a big thing. When I do get it, it\xe2\x80\x99s a thing.\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cFor the 100th time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t care.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But this of course was hard to believe, because Westbrook cares about everything.'b''b'In Oklahoma City'b' in December, on a day off between his triple-doubles, Russell Westbrook sat on the Rolling Thunder Book Bus. This is a staple of the team\xe2\x80\x99s community-outreach program: a school bus that has been converted into a mobile library. That afternoon it was parked, under the wide blue Great Plains sky, in front of a suburban elementary school. Westbrook was there early, long before the kids started lining up, before even the team\xe2\x80\x99s P.R. director arrived. He sat in the bus\xe2\x80\x99s driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat, sheltered from the Oklahoma wind, waiting, passing the time by cranking the tall doors open and closed with a lever near the steering wheel.'b'Open, closed, open, closed.'b'Eventually, a line of third graders formed, and Westbrook prepared himself by stockpiling, methodically in his left hand, a supply of bookmarks and bracelets, which he would hand to the kids as they came through. One by one, the students walked to the bus door. When they saw Westbrook sitting at the top of the stairs, they were variously awed or thrilled or confused or stoic.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you really Russell Westbrook?\xe2\x80\x9d a little boy asked him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI met you at a gas station before!\xe2\x80\x9d one girl said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was at the game last night!\xe2\x80\x9d another said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was, too!\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook answered.'b'He directed the third graders toward their favorite reading: Captain Underpants, Goosebumps, Bunnicula, Bad Kitty. (The Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s backup point guard, Semaj Christon, was in the back, helping them find specific books.) \xe2\x80\x9cHave fun in school,\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook told everyone as they left the bus.'b'Midway through the session, a boy stepped onto the Book Bus with one of his shoelaces dragging behind him.'b'Westbrook looked down at the floor.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTie your shoe, man,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The boy looked down, too, then kept walking to the back of the bus and picked a book.'b'When the boy re-emerged, Westbrook handed him a bracelet and a bookmark.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave fun in school,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd tie your shoe up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The boy walked off the bus, shoelace still flopping around.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t forget to tie your shoe!\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook shouted out the door.'b'From that point on in his Book Bus session, Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s focus was locked onto the children\xe2\x80\x99s shoelaces, a strangely high percentage of which seemed to be loose. \xe2\x80\x9cYour shoe is loose,\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook would say as a child walked onto the bus. \xe2\x80\x9cTie your shoe up.\xe2\x80\x9d He was cheerful but firm; he seemed genuinely concerned. Dozens of kids passed through the bus, and Westbrook scrutinized each of their shoes, and not a single loose lace was allowed to pass without comment. Over and over, he told the kids to tie their shoes. Even when the laces were not all the way untied, just trending in that direction, Westbrook pointed it out: \xe2\x80\x9cTie your shoes up.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if he had identified a public safety epidemic that he was single-handedly going to fix, one child at a time.'b'One boy stepped onto the bus with both of his shoes intentionally untied, laces dragging like catfish whiskers.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou like to wear your shoes like that, huh?\xe2\x80\x9d Westbrook said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s what I used to do, so I get it. But you gotta tuck \xe2\x80\x99em in.\xe2\x80\x9d And before the boy could go back and get his book, Westbrook actually knelt down on the floor of the bus and tucked the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shoelaces into the sides of his shoes.'b'After a while, the Book Bus session ended, and the kids and the players took a photo together outside, and then all the kids returned to their classrooms, laces safely snug on their feet, and Russell Westbrook drove off in a white Cadillac sedan, flexing his mind-muscle on other problems.'b''b'Sometimes a place'b' and a person align in unexpectedly powerful ways. For its entire existence, Oklahoma City has suffered from a particularly nasty case of a particularly American curse: volatility. It was founded in 1889, in one chaotic afternoon, with a land run that brought the population instantly from zero to 10,000. Its economy is a never-ending cycle of oil-industry booms and busts. Its weather features killer tornadoes erupting suddenly out of placid skies. Even Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x99s formerly stable earth has, in recent years, begun to spasm: activities associated with hydrofracking, source of the region\xe2\x80\x99s most recent economic boom, have kicked off an escalating series of earthquake swarms.'b'The departure last summer of Kevin Durant \xe2\x80\x94 a pillar of stability for almost 10 years, a player who had talked all his career about how he wanted to stay with the Thunder forever \xe2\x80\x94 was magnified, for locals, by the knowledge of this history. This is what happens in OKC. Talented people leave, dreams die, booms go bust. Especially when things seem to be at their best, everything tends to fall apart.'b'After Durant left, there was endless speculation that Westbrook would leave, too, and it would have been hard to blame him if he had. Looking around the league, Westbrook would have seen almost nothing but bigger cities with stronger teams and better restaurants and livelier fashion scenes \xe2\x80\x94 any one of which would have bent over backward for the chance to add him to its mix. Instead, Westbrook signed a contract extension to stay in Oklahoma. It was, in some ways, a crazy choice, unreasonable on many levels, which made it of course the perfect Westbrook thing to do.'b'Westbrook once told me that growing up in Los Angeles, he had no idea Oklahoma City even existed. And yet he has become, in his odd balance of chaos and control, his volatile lurching toward greatness, a sort of human embodiment of the place. Westbrook was already beloved in OKC, but his decision to stay turned him into a legend. The city was hung with banners saying \xe2\x80\x9cWHY NOT?\xe2\x80\x9d and the tallest skyscraper lit up with Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s name: \xe2\x80\x9cTHANK YOU RUSS.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are people in Oklahoma City who hold themselves differently because of Russell Westbrook,\xe2\x80\x9d Sam Presti, the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s general manager, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean that literally. They stand up straighter. People, not necessarily athletes, draw confidence from him and his disregard for the judgment or labeling from others. I\xe2\x80\x99m confident that there are a lot of people in this city that go into job interviews saying to themselves: \xe2\x80\x98Come on, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got this \xe2\x80\x94 be Westbrook, think Westbrook.\xe2\x80\x99 And that might actually help them get the job, and if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, they walk out feeling sorry for the person that missed the opportunity to hire them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This is the lesson of Russell Westbrook. In a deeply imperfect world \xe2\x80\x94 a world where a shooting touch will suddenly abandon you at the worst possible moment, where your teammates might not be good enough to make a win possible, where an economy might suddenly collapse for no apparent reason, where the decency of strangers cannot be presumed \xe2\x80\x94 in a world like that, Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s approach to life might actually be the most rational one. You control the things you can control (family, daily routines, the occasional big choice) and outside that you fling yourself with wild abandon, every day, at every object that seems worthy of pursuit. In the absence of guarantees, in the absence of certainty, in the new American volatility, we can bank on only one thing: total presence, total sincerity, total effort, all the time. That is the sound of one hand clapping.'b'Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s critics have been very loud for many years. They are quieter today, but they\xe2\x80\x99re still out there, disputing the magnitude of his triple-doubles by pointing to his high turnover rate and his low shooting percentage, his inefficiencies, his mistakes. But, as Billy Donovan, the Thunder\xe2\x80\x99s head coach, told me, this is missing the point. \xe2\x80\x9cBefore you go to the criticism,\xe2\x80\x9d Donovan said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have to understand Russell Westbrook. The No. 1 thing for him is how hard he competes. It starts there. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean he plays a perfect game, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he never turns the ball over, doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t miss a defensive assignment. But when the ball is loose on the glass or on the floor, when it requires energy and passion and fire \xe2\x80\x94 Russell is bringing that. So many players live with regret: They could have done a little bit more, been more committed, worked harder. I think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a great level of peace when his time is done. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to be able to move on with his life. He\xe2\x80\x99s going to have peace in his heart.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Through 41 games,'b' the official halfway point of the season, Russell Westbrook was actually doing it: He was averaging a triple-double \xe2\x80\x94 30.7 points, 10.5 assists, and 10.7 rebounds. Stat-heads calculated that, if you adjusted Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s numbers to reflect the pace of the Oscar Robertson era, they would look like nothing we\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen in the history of anything: nearly 50 points, 17 rebounds, 17 assists. Historical comparisons are impossible to draw in such a linear way, of course. But still. It is possible that we are witnessing, in real time, a performance as aberrant as anything any of the primordial basketball legends (Wilt, Oscar, Bill Russell, Pistol Pete) ever did. We may as well start broadcasting Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s games in grainy black and white.'b'And the second half of the season may actually be better. Westbrook\xe2\x80\x99s self-mythology \xe2\x80\x94 his belief that he is an underdog \xe2\x80\x94 was no doubt stoked last month when he learned that, despite all his exorbitant numbers, despite his decision to stay in Oklahoma, despite the game-winning shots and the surprising success of his relatively untalented team, he was not chosen to start in this year\xe2\x80\x99s All-Star Game. His spot was taken by a player more popular with N.B.A. fans, the ever-sunny Steph Curry \xe2\x80\x94 Kevin Durant\xe2\x80\x99s new point guard. So Westbrook did what he does and launched himself into his next triple-double.'b''b''b''b''b''b'O'b'ne night in September 2014, when he was chief executive of Breitbart News, Stephen Bannon hosted cocktails and dinner at the Washington townhouse where he lived, a mansion near the Supreme Court that he liked to call the Breitbart Embassy. Beneath elaborate chandeliers and flanked by gold drapes and stately oil paintings, Jeff Sessions, then a senator from Alabama, sat next to the guest of honor: Nigel Farage, the insurgent British politician, who first met Sessions two years earlier when Bannon introduced them. Farage was building support for his right-wing party by complaining in the British press about \xe2\x80\x9cuncontrolled mass immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d Sessions, like other attendees, was celebrating the recent collapse in Congress of bipartisan immigration reform, which would have provided a path to citizenship for some undocumented people. At the dinner, Sessions 'b'told a writer for Vice'b', Reid Cherlin, that Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s site was instrumental in defeating the measure. Sessions read Breitbart almost every day, he explained, because it was \xe2\x80\x9cputting out cutting-edge information.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Bannon\xe2\x80\x99s role in blocking the reform had gone beyond sympathetic coverage on his site. Over the previous year, he, Sessions and one of Sessions\xe2\x80\x99s top aides, Stephen Miller, spent \xe2\x80\x9can enormous amount of time\xe2\x80\x9d meeting in person, \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloping plans and messaging and strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d as 'b'Miller later explained'b' to Rosie Gray in The Atlantic. Breitbart writers also 'b'reportedly'b' met with Sessions\xe2\x80\x99s staff for a weekly happy hour at the Union Pub. For most Republicans in Washington, immigration was an issue they wished would go away, a persistent source of conflict between the party\xe2\x80\x99s elites, who saw it as a straightforward economic good, and its middle-class voting base, who mistrusted the effects of immigration on employment. But for Bannon, Sessions and Miller, immigration was a galvanizing issue, lying at the center of their apparent vision for reshaping the United States by tethering it to its European and Christian origins. (None of them would comment for this article.) That September evening, as they celebrated the collapse of the reform effort \xe2\x80\x94 and the rise of Farage, whose own anti-immigration party in Britain represented the new brand of nativism \xe2\x80\x94 it felt like the beginning of something new. \xe2\x80\x9cI was privileged enough to be at it,\xe2\x80\x9d Miller said about the gathering last June, while a guest on Breitbart\xe2\x80\x99s SiriusXM radio show. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s going to sound like a motivational speech, but it\xe2\x80\x99s true. To all the voters out there: The only limits to what we can achieve is what we believe we can achieve.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The answer to what they could achieve, of course, is now obvious: everything. Bannon and Miller are ensconced in the West Wing, as arguably the two most influential policy advisers to Donald J. Trump. And Jeff Sessions is now the attorney general of the United States. The genesis of their working relationship is crucial to understanding the far-reaching domestic goals of the Trump presidency and how the law may be used to attain them over the next four years. Bannon and Sessions have effectively presented the country\xe2\x80\x99s changing demographics \xe2\x80\x94 the rising number of minority and foreign-born residents \xe2\x80\x94 as America\xe2\x80\x99s chief internal threat. Sessions has long been an outlier in his party on this subject; in 2013, when his Republican colleagues were talking primarily about curbing illegal immigration, he offered a proposal to curb 'b'legal'b' immigration. ('b'It failed in committee'b', 17 to one.)'b'Talking to Bannon on air in September 2015, Sessions, who has 'b'received'b' 'b'awards'b' from virulently anti-immigrant groups, 'b'described'b' the present day as a dangerous period of \xe2\x80\x9cradical change\xe2\x80\x9d for America, comparing it to the decades of the early 20th century, when waves of immigrants flooded the country. He said that the 1924 immigration quota system, which barred most Asians and tightly capped the entry of Italians, Jews, Africans and Middle Easterners, \xe2\x80\x9cwas good for America.\xe2\x80\x9d Bannon is also uncomfortable with the changing face of the country. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen two-thirds or three-quarters of the C.E.O.s in Silicon Valley are from South Asia or from Asia, I think \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he said'b' on the radio with Trump in November 2015, vastly exaggerating the actual numbers. \xe2\x80\x9cA country is more than an economy. We\xe2\x80\x99re a civic society.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At a time when other, more libertarian conservatives had begun to embrace critiques of the criminal-justice system, each man saw crime as yet another way that the fabric of society was deteriorating. While Bannon was chief executive, Breitbart created a specific tag for articles called \xe2\x80\x9cblack crime\xe2\x80\x9d and ran article after article demonizing the Black Lives Matter movement (calling protesters \xe2\x80\x9cblood-lusting junkies\xe2\x80\x9d) and showing Latino immigrants as violent (\xe2\x80\x9cOne Sex Offender Illegal Alien Caught After Another Alleged Offender Legalized\xe2\x80\x9d). The site also frequently covered Sessions\xe2\x80\x99s condemnations of criminal-justice reform. Opposing a bipartisan bill to reduce sentences for some nonviolent drug offenses, Sessions said last May that Republican supporters of the legislation \xe2\x80\x9cin no way represent the conservative movement\xe2\x80\x9d and warned against \xe2\x80\x9csigning death warrants for thousands of American innocent citizens.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the Republican primary season progressed, it became clear to Sessions and Bannon that Trump could be the vessel for their brand of Republicanism. Back in August 2015, Bannon emailed a friend, 'b'according to The Daily Beast'b', that while he felt good about other candidates like Ted Cruz, he was ready to pick Trump, because he was \xe2\x80\x9ca nationalist who embraces\xe2\x80\x9d Sessions\xe2\x80\x99s immigration plan. Six months later, Sessions became the first senator to endorse Trump for president. Last August, Sessions 'b'helped create'b' a new immigration policy for Trump, which called for reducing immigration by, among other things, tightening the rules about visas for high-skilled workers. That same month, Bannon took over Trump\xe2\x80\x99s campaign.'b'Their shared view was central to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Inaugural Address, which, 'b'according to The Wall Street Journal'b', Bannon and Miller principally wrote. For a president taking office amid peacetime and economic growth, the speech offered a singularly dark vision. Trump spoke of \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican carnage\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a country made increasingly dangerous by \xe2\x80\x9cthe crime and the gangs and the drugs,\xe2\x80\x9d its economy ravaged by production abroad, its borders infiltrated by marauders. The speech was a perfect distillation of the foreboding view of America broadcast by Breitbart \xe2\x80\x94 a land in disarray and decline that has reached the point of crisis.'b'In fact, violent crime has been 'b'declining sharply'b' for 25 years; with a small uptick in 2015, it remains low. The number of undocumented immigrants has 'b'fallen slightly'b' in the last decade, and these newcomers are 'b'less likely'b' to commit violent crimes than people who were born here. Evidence shows that immigrants are an engine of economic growth and entrepreneurship. While they take a small bite out of the wages of native-born workers without a high school diploma, they provide an overall boost to productivity that increases the pay of more educated workers by up to 10 percent, 'b'labor economists say'b'. As for the \xe2\x80\x9ctotalitarian threat\xe2\x80\x9d that, according to Sessions, Americans face from radical Islam, since Sept. 11, white supremacists and other non-Muslim extremists have killed nearly twice as many Americans as radical Muslims, 'b'according to the New America Foundation'b'.'b'Why would the Trump administration paint a picture so starkly at odds with reality? It\xe2\x80\x99s simple: A vision of the nation besieged provides clear justification for policies that will advance Sessions, Bannon and Miller\xe2\x80\x99s divisive nationalism. In the administration\xe2\x80\x99s early moves, we can already see the contours beginning to take shape. An executive order presented as an emergency measure to protect the country from terrorists winds up barring immigrants coming here to study or work from seven countries that have not been a source of terrorist attacks in the United States since Sept. 11. Another order refers to immigrants who \xe2\x80\x9cpose a risk to public safety\xe2\x80\x9d and then makes millions of the undocumented people in the country a priority for deportation. Impending catastrophe grants the president broad powers, and those powers are used broadly.'b'It is through the Justice Department that the administration is likely to advance its nationalist plans \xe2\x80\x94 to strengthen the grip of law enforcement, raise barriers to voting and significantly reduce all forms of immigration, promoting what seems to be a longstanding desire to reassert the country\xe2\x80\x99s European and Christian heritage. It\xe2\x80\x99s not an accident that Sessions, who presumably could have chosen from a number of plum assignments, opted for the role of attorney general. The Department of Justice is the most valuable perch from which to transform the country in the way he and Bannon have wanted. With an exaggerated threat of disorder looming, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s top law-enforcement agency could become a machine for trying to fundamentally change who gets to be an American and what rights they can enjoy.'b''b'The Department of'b' Justice employs a staff of 115,000, including more than 10,000 lawyers. Besides encompassing the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration, the department administers the federal prison system; prosecutes financial fraud, federal environmental crimes and national-security violations; and oversees the country\xe2\x80\x99s 93 United States attorneys (who prosecute federal crimes throughout the country). The department also includes two critical sites for setting legal policy. The Office of the Solicitor General decides the positions the federal government takes in the appeals courts and before the Supreme Court, and the Office of Legal Counsel advises the president about the legality of his actions and executive orders, passing judgment like an internal court.'b'The traditional explanation for the founding of the Department of Justice in 1870 has heroic overtones: Congress and President Ulysses S. Grant were purportedly determined to enforce Reconstruction and protect the civil rights of former slaves. But in recent years, a more pragmatic narrative has taken hold. As the Fordham law professor Jed Handelsman Shugerman explains it, the story is really about cutting costs, weeding out cronyism and reining in radical Republican lawyers who wanted to aggressively enforce the policies of Reconstruction. In a 2014 article 'b'in The Stanford Law Review'b', Shugerman points out that the creation of the Justice Department reduced the federal legal staff by one-third. While a handful of determined lawyers successfully prosecuted Ku Klux Klan members in the early years, for the most part, Shugerman told me, \xe2\x80\x9cthe D.O.J. handcuffed the federal government\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers from doing more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the time, lawyers worked all over Washington, in the State Department, the Interior Department and elsewhere. But it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the opening in 1934 of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s current headquarters, an imposing building the size of a large square block, that the department became a strong institutional presence. Justice Department lawyers flexed their muscles defending the New Deal, and the agency expanded in scope.'b'For all the vast sweep of the Department of Justice as a whole, much of its influence over the major political conflicts of our time, and certainly those poised to dominate the next four years, is concentrated within the civil rights division, charged as it is with ensuring equal protection under the law. With a staff of roughly 700, the division is basically the watchdog of the government and also a kind of police of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s police, because it has the power to investigate departments for violations of civil rights law. It can also sue localities for discrimination in housing, education and employment, on the basis of sex, national origin, religion or disability as well as race. The division also protects the rights of people in prison and mental institutions.'b'When the division was founded in 1957, it was staffed by a handful of lawyers who largely refrained from directly challenging Jim Crow in the South. But when Robert F. Kennedy became attorney general in 1961, things changed. He \xe2\x80\x9chad his own ambitions,\xe2\x80\x9d Shugerman says. \xe2\x80\x9cEven as J.F.K. tried to steer the ship down the middle, R.F.K. pulled it toward civil rights.\xe2\x80\x9d In the 1970s and early \xe2\x80\x9980s, the civil rights division\xe2\x80\x99s ranks grew, attracting top law-school graduates to nonpartisan civil-service jobs. Many of them hoped to serve in the tradition of lawyers like John Doar, a Republican from Wisconsin who lived in a dorm for weeks with James Meredith, the first African-American student to attend the University of Mississippi, during his struggle to register for classes in 1962. \xe2\x80\x9cMost of us were liberals, and we were passionate about fighting the country\xe2\x80\x99s long history of racial injustice,\xe2\x80\x9d says William Yeomans, who worked in the division for 24 years, beginning in 1981.'b'Political battles over the priorities of the division have been escalating for decades. During Democratic presidencies, the division has moved to challenge intentional discrimination by individuals (like a landlord who turns away an African-American couple and then rents to a white one) and has sought to combat policies that disproportionally affect minorities, even if it\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to prove they\xe2\x80\x99re racially motivated (like a low-income housing program that funnels African-American recipients into mostly minority areas). Republican administrations since the Reagan era, by contrast, have tended to bring individual rather than broad suits while also treating civil rights as race-neutral or colorblind and opposing affirmative action. They have also been equally likely to sue on behalf of white and black people who say they face unequal treatment. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Republican view of civil rights focuses on the protection of the individual,\xe2\x80\x9d says Robert Driscoll, chief of staff of the civil rights division during George W. Bush\xe2\x80\x99s first term. The Republican approach has caused tension with the career staff. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever the G.O.P. is in office, there\xe2\x80\x99s a certain amount of heat on whoever is in charge,\xe2\x80\x9d Driscoll says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe career people hated us when I was there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'During the Obama administration in particular, the civil rights division began to take on a whole gamut of institutions. Under the leadership of Tom Perez, it went after banks, arguing that Wells Fargo and Bank of America systematically steered African-American and Latino homeowners toward subprime loans, and winning the 'b'largest settlements'b' in the history of the Fair Housing Act, totaling about $570 million. In 2014, Vanita Gupta arrived from the A.C.L.U. to lead the division, and under her direction, the department addressed prisons and schools, working to 'b'reduce solitary confinement'b', 'b'discouraging the arrest of students'b' for disciplinary infractions and 'b'instructing schools'b' across the country to let transgender students use the bathrooms of their choice. (Sessions led the charge in the Trump administration to 'b'rescind the order'b' about bathroom access.) Another significant power Perez and Gupta exercised was oversight of local police forces, investigating 25 departments for problems like excessive use of force, unlawful arrests and racially discriminatory policing. Twenty of those investigations ended in consent decrees, a form of agreement that entails monitoring by the courts.'b'In this way, the Justice Department under Obama used civil rights enforcement \xe2\x80\x94 or the potential for it \xe2\x80\x94 to check private, local and state entities that otherwise would have escaped federal intervention. But Sessions can pull back on such oversight, even to an extent (if he chooses) beyond that of his Republican predecessors. Invoking Trump\xe2\x80\x99s nightmare vision of America as beset by lawlessness, the department can unbind the hands of law-enforcement agencies around the country. On issues like immigration and voting rights, with public perceptions influenced by inflated tales of criminality (improper use of benefits, voter fraud), a Sessions-led Department of Justice can both feed the narrative of crime and react to it, through heightened investigations and prosecutions. A civil rights system built up to protect the minority from the majority could quickly turn into the reverse.'b''b'Crime \xe2\x80\x94 especially urban crime \xe2\x80\x94'b' lies at the heart of the new nationalist message, in part as an argument for why liberal-run cities, with their dense, diverse, polyglot communities, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t serve as a model for the nation as a whole. Since the outset of his campaign, Trump has exaggerated the violence and poverty of \xe2\x80\x9cinner cities,\xe2\x80\x9d painting them as war zones and blaming Democrats for the destruction. The politics behind this sort of language are not new: For 50 years, Republican candidates for president have won by stoking fear of crime, promising to \xe2\x80\x9crestore order and respect for law in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d as Richard Nixon put it in 1968. But Trump has been fixated on the issue, ignoring actual crime statistics to 'b'inaccurately blame'b' African-Americans for most white homicides and falsely claim that the murder rate is at its highest point in 47 years.'b'While many conservative figures kept their distance from Trump during the campaign, one group embraced him wholeheartedly: law-enforcement unions. The rank and file did, too. A survey before the election by Police Magazine found that 84 percent of officers who planned to vote backed him, while just 8 percent supported Hillary Clinton. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s views on the Black Lives Matter movement, which many cops have seen as unfair and a danger to policing minority neighborhoods, no doubt played a part. Last summer, Trump called the movement a \xe2\x80\x9cthreat,\xe2\x80\x9d blaming it for the deaths of officers and adding, \xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have to perhaps talk with the attorney general about it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Today the test is how Trump\xe2\x80\x99s new attorney general will view the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility, conferred by Congress in 1994 after the beating of Rodney King, to investigate local police departments for a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern or practice\xe2\x80\x9d of civil rights violations. With more than 12,000 police departments across the country, the division couldn\xe2\x80\x99t exercise anything approaching true national oversight even if it wanted to. (Perez and Gupta\xe2\x80\x99s total of 25 investigations was equal to that of the Clinton Justice Department over eight years; the Bush administration initiated 21.) But the Obama Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to enter cities like Chicago, Baltimore and Ferguson, Mo., after high-profile encounters between the police and African-Americans meant that officers everywhere had to reckon with the possibility of federal investigation \xe2\x80\x94 at a time when many of them already felt under siege.'b'Consider Chicago, which throughout the campaign was Trump\xe2\x80\x99s exemplar of a city rife with \xe2\x80\x9ccarnage.\xe2\x80\x9d Chicago has been 'b'reeling'b' from a major spike in gun violence and killings, but it is also a city with a sordid history of police abuses. Under Gupta, the civil rights division opened an investigation into the city\xe2\x80\x99s police department in 2015, after the release of a video of the killing of Laquan McDonald, a 17-year-old who was shot 16 times by an officer while the teenager was walking away. After hundreds of hours of interviews with police officers, residents and city officials, the civil rights division issued an unsparing 'b'set of findings'b' in January, faulting the police department for routinely using excessive force (especially against African-Americans and Latinos), a deficient system for investigating police misconduct and a poor structure of supervision, promotion and training. The Chicago Fraternal Order of Police 'b'welcomed'b' the parts of the report about training and promotion. But the union objected to the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s implication that race affects police decision-making, arguing that officers are simply targeting criminal behavior in high-crime areas, not African-Americans and Latinos.'b'Now the police have an attorney general who has been unwilling to give credence to their critics. Confronting Gupta in November 2015 at a Senate hearing called the War on Police, Sessions suggested that the civil rights division was going \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond fair and balanced treatment\xe2\x80\x9d of law enforcement. Sessions has also 'b'called'b' court-monitored consent decrees, which the Justice Department has used to settle school desegregation cases in addition to police investigations, \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most dangerous, and rarely discussed, exercises of raw power.\xe2\x80\x9d The problem, in other words, isn\xe2\x80\x99t what the police are doing. It\xe2\x80\x99s that the federal government is interfering.'b'In appearing to categorically oppose consent decrees and signaling a lack of interest in broad new investigations, Sessions appears to be going further than even police groups do. \xe2\x80\x9cNo officer worth his badge would say \xe2\x80\x98no investigations\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89if an investigation is warranted,\xe2\x80\x9d James Pasco, executive director of the Fraternal Order of Police, told me. But that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean the police wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t like the Justice Department to back off in Chicago, where no consent decree was negotiated before Obama\xe2\x80\x99s and Gupta\xe2\x80\x99s departures, and it\xe2\x80\x99s now up to Sessions to decide what an agreement of any kind should look like, or whether it should exist at all.'b'The question for the country is what happens if local police departments, relieved of the realistic prospect of federal oversight, feel their hands are untied in tense situations. On an evening in January when Fox News ran a segment on the recent spike in murders in Chicago, Trump tweeted a few minutes later that he could \xe2\x80\x9csend in the feds!\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to know what Trump meant, but he was not talking about protecting civil rights. The next time a disturbing video of a police shooting surfaces, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy to imagine Trump and Sessions supporting the police without question and directing a crackdown on protesters, especially if they\xe2\x80\x99re mostly black. That would connect the Trumpist edition of law and order to the apparent project of undermining the rights of minorities and their claim on the national conscience.'b''b'Another way'b''b' in which'b' the Department of Justice could move to advance the Sessions and Bannon agenda is through its approach to voting laws. The civil rights division\xe2\x80\x99s powers in this area flow mostly from the Voting Rights Act, which Congress passed in 1965 to help African-Americans vote. Section 5 of the act gave the Justice Department unusual authority to review any proposed change to an election practice in a state or county with a history of low minority registration, mostly in the South. The division\xe2\x80\x99s voting section has largely seen its role ever since as safeguarding the rights of minority voters. During both Democratic and Republican administrations, Justice Department lawyers used Section 5 to block localities from redrawing district lines or closing polling places \xe2\x80\x94 and to block strict voter-ID laws from taking effect.'b'But in 2013, in a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision in 'b'Shelby County v. Holder'b', Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. argued for the majority that Section 5 was no longer necessary because \xe2\x80\x9cthings have changed dramatically\xe2\x80\x9d in the South. After the ruling, however, Southern states rushed to make it more difficult for people to vote. Hundreds of polling places were closed throughout the region, and Texas and North Carolina passed strict voter-ID laws. North Carolina also ended same-day registration and out-of-precinct voting and reduced the early-voting period to one week from two.'b'The Obama Justice Department responded by joining civil rights groups in suing Texas and North Carolina, claiming the laws had the effect of discriminating against minority voters. Matching voter rolls to the records in state and federal databases, experts hired by the Justice Department determined that more than 600,000 voters in Texas lacked the required ID and that they were disproportionately black and Latino. An appeals court ruled against Texas last July. Nine days later, a second appeals court struck down North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s law, saying the restrictions \xe2\x80\x9ctarget African-American voters with almost surgical precision.\xe2\x80\x9d Obama urged other states to heed the lesson in his final speech as president: \xe2\x80\x9cWe should be making it easier, not harder, to vote.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Trump and Sessions are poised to do precisely the opposite, creating a rationale for restricting voting instead of expanding it. On Monday, the Justice Department switched positions by 'b'dropping the key claim'b' that Texas passed its voter ID law with the intent to discriminate. Over the last few months, the president has claimed that millions of people voted illegally in November. In fact, just 'b'four cases'b' of in-person voter fraud have been identified from the 2016 presidential election, and a Loyola Law School 'b'study in 2014'b' discovered only 31 credible allegations of fraud in a sample of one billion votes. Pressed for evidence by Bill O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly on Fox, Trump promised that Vice President Mike Pence would lead a commission to investigate the nation\xe2\x80\x99s voting rolls. A week later, Stephen Miller 'b'falsely insisted'b' on TV that \xe2\x80\x9c14 percent of noncitizens\xe2\x80\x9d are registered to vote \xe2\x80\x94 portraying the country as vulnerable to shadowy foreign hordes who undermine the very core of American democracy.'b'Raising the alarm about illegal voting furthers the Republican Party\xe2\x80\x99s current strategy for preserving power. For more than a decade, Republican state legislators have used the myth of widespread fraud to justify tightening voting and registration rules. This year, 46 new bills to restrict access to voting and registration have been introduced in 21 states, 'b'according to the Brennan Center for Justice'b'. Making it harder to vote tends to help Republicans win office, in part because it tends to have a disproportionate impact 'b'on minority voters'b', who are 'b'less likely'b' to have a required form of ID and who generally support Democrats. Over the next four election cycles, the national share of eligible voters who are minorities is 'b'projected'b' to rise steadily, to about 40 percent from about 30 percent. Bluntly put, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s supporters, who were 90 percent white, can continue to put Republican candidates over the top only if an increasing number of minority voters stay away from \xe2\x80\x94 or are kept away from \xe2\x80\x94 the polls.'b'The Republican hunt for voter fraud has 'b'a history'b'. After George W. Bush narrowly beat Al Gore in 2000, his attorney general created an election-integrity task force, spurring United States attorneys to search for voter fraud. One of them, David Iglesias, a Republican in New Mexico, looked into more than 100 complaints but couldn\xe2\x80\x99t find enough evidence for a single prosecution. He was fired in 2006 along with eight other United States attorneys. 'b'An investigation'b' by the Justice Department later found that most of the dismissals were a serious abuse of executive power, because they were a response to the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 refusing to bring unsubstantiated voter-fraud charges or politically motivated charges against Democratic officials, or both as in Iglesias\xe2\x80\x99 case. Congressional hearings related to the firings took down Alberto Gonzales, Bush\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general at the time.'b'Bush appointees in the civil rights division were also caught trying to illegally push out career civil rights lawyers and replace them with conservatives. In an internal email, one Bush appointee, Brad Schlozman, wrote to another Republican: \xe2\x80\x9cMy tentative plans are to gerrymander all those crazy libs right out of the section.\xe2\x80\x9d By the end of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s term, most of the career attorneys had been pushed out or had left. \xe2\x80\x9cThey attacked everything we were supposed to stand for,\xe2\x80\x9d says Joe Rich, who spent 36 years in the division.'b'During Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency, new career lawyers were hired, but Sessions could try to transfer them or lay them off. The Heritage Foundation has called for reducing the civil rights division\xe2\x80\x99s budget by $58 million, or about one-third.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not clear yet who will lead Sessions\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights division. In the short term, Sessions has put the division in the hands of conservatives who have a record of defending voting restrictions. Tom Wheeler, the acting head, advised Texas Republicans when they wrote their voter-ID law. John Gore, the No. 2, has defended jurisdictions against voting rights challenges at the law firm Jones Day in Washington, working frequently with Michael Carvin, a founder of the conservative legal movement in the Reagan Justice Department. (Sessions also worked for that Justice Department as a United States attorney in west Alabama, and in 1985 'b'he prosecuted'b' three black civil rights activists for voter fraud. The case, which collapsed at trial, was one reason he was not confirmed for a federal judgeship the following year.)'b'In 2012, Gore and Carvin defended Florida when it was sued \xe2\x80\x94 by the Justice Department as well as civil rights groups \xe2\x80\x94 over an effort to purge the rolls of noncitizens. Florida was implementing the 1993 Motor Voter law, which, in addition to improving access to registration, instructed states to remove people, within limits, from the rolls if they had moved away or died. The state wrongly flagged thousands of American citizens, most of them Latino. Florida 'b'lost the suit'b' on appeal and stopped the purge. Now Gore will help decide the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s position if another state is suspected of expunging voters unlawfully. And he or other Sessions appointees could shift the work of the career lawyers in the voting section to push states to go through their voter rolls. Though keeping the rolls up to date is a good idea in theory, when states flag voters who have a Latino name or are naturalized citizens, the burden is on the voters to prove the state has erred. Otherwise they can\xe2\x80\x99t vote.'b''b'To turn back 'b'the clock on immigration, Sessions, Bannon and Trump would have to prevent more immigrants from coming in and remove those who are here. Trump\xe2\x80\x99s Jan. 27 executive order banning refugees and travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries, reportedly overseen by Bannon and Miller, was the initial bid to shut the door. On Feb. 20, the Department of Homeland Security announced the new guidance that vastly broadened the definition of who is considered a priority for deportation.'b'It falls to immigration agents at the Department of Homeland Security, not the Department of Justice, to pick people up. But Sessions has a major role to play. To begin with, he oversees the nation\xe2\x80\x99s immigration courts. The Feb. 20 guidelines call for the Justice Department to send a surge of judges to the border to turn people around with a type of speedy removal, entailing only the barest form of legal process \xe2\x80\x94 a practice that Trump just expanded far beyond what any president has authorized (and which now applies in the interior of the country as well). Sessions also has the authority to streamline appeals, by expanding a cursory form of review used during the Bush years, and to overturn Obama-era decisions that have made it easier to receive asylum or get legal counsel.'b'Democratic mayors and governors have vowed not to cooperate with a federal crackdown, and Trump has responded with an order asking the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to withhold federal funds from them. It will be up to Sessions to decide how far to go in trying to cancel grants that cities receive from his department (for drug treatment and crime prevention, for example).'b'Detention and deportation on a mass scale would be a gargantuan task \xe2\x80\x94 divisive, enormously costly and legally fraught. The only feasible way to get millions of undocumented immigrants out of the country, as Trump has promised, is to create a climate that induces immigrants to leave on their own. \xe2\x80\x9cYou basically would have [to] self-deport,\xe2\x80\x9d Sessions 'b'said on CNN'b' last fall. That means \xe2\x80\x9cleveraging fear,\xe2\x80\x9d as Kamal Essaheb, policy director for the National Immigration Law Center, puts it. The Feb. 20 guidelines direct immigration agents to \xe2\x80\x9crefer appropriate cases for criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d Those cases would go to federal prosecutors and could lead to yearslong prison terms. An estimated eight million people go to work in this country every day without papers. Sending a rash of them to prison could do more than the threat of deportation to send laborers across the country packing.'b'Sessions has supported an experiment in self-deportation before. In June 2011, when he was a senator, Alabama enacted the 'b'most restrictive'b' immigration law in the country. Called H.B. 56, it gave law enforcement the authority to ask for a driver\xe2\x80\x99s papers, mandated the arrest of people who lacked proper documents and required people to show proof of citizenship when they interacted with a government agency. Residents were required to provide identification to renew a mobile-home license or register a child for school.'b'Immigrants 'b'left Alabama'b' for fear of being arrested; others were afraid to send their children to school. Laura Ingraham, the conservative radio host, invited Sessions on her show to discuss H.B. 56 that fall. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think it\xe2\x80\x99s bad\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9call these Hispanic kids have disappeared from schools?\xe2\x80\x9d she asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll I would just say to you is it\xe2\x80\x99s a sad thing that we\xe2\x80\x99ve allowed a situation to occur for decades in which large numbers of people are in the country illegally,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'Sessions answered'b'.'b'Many business leaders opposed H.B. 56 for taking away their workers and customers. The law was projected to cost the state between $2 billion and $11 billion in lost G.D.P. in its first year, according to 'b'an estimate'b' by a University of Alabama economist. One farmer challenged a state legislator to pick his tomatoes for him. But in 'b'an interview'b' in The Daily Caller, Sessions claimed that the opposition to H.B. 56 was \xe2\x80\x9can effort by leftist, activist immigration advocates.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cIncredibly, the Department of Justice has joined in on that aggressively.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At the time, the Obama Justice Department was suing Alabama in federal court over the immigration restrictions alongside a coalition of churches and civil rights groups. Concerned about the impact on families, Obama\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers argued that Alabama was going further than federal law allowed. \xe2\x80\x9cOur visions of immigrant rights and civil rights were inextricably intertwined,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Perez, then head of the civil rights division, told me. In court, the plaintiffs invoked a 1982 Supreme Court decision, 'b'Plyler v. Doe'b', which found that undocumented children have a constitutional right to an education.'b'In November 2013, the Justice Department succeeded in permanently blocking most of H.B. 56. The civil rights divisions of the Department of Justice and the Department of Education followed with a letter in 2014 to every school district in the country, warning against any policy that could dissuade students from enrolling because of their families\xe2\x80\x99 immigration status. The Justice Department also defended Obama\xe2\x80\x99s actions to allow young people brought to the United States as children, called Dreamers, and their close relatives to work or go to school without fear of deportation. Sessions could review that directive and call for withdrawing it, perhaps as a misuse of prosecutorial discretion. In other words, the Justice Department, especially in the last few years, has operated in several ways to make undocumented families more secure. Sessions can repurpose the machinery to do something else entirely.'b''b'Before Sessions was'b' confirmed as attorney general, Sally Yates, a holdover from the Obama administration, was serving in that role. When Trump issued his refugee and travel ban on Jan. 27, she refused to defend the order in court, saying she was not convinced that his order was lawful or consistent with the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to \xe2\x80\x9cstand for what is right.\xe2\x80\x9d Trump quickly fired Yates amid a predictably partisan debate over whether she was acting on an important principle or failing to do her job.'b'In almost all circumstances, the top law-enforcement official in the executive branch is expected to side with the chief of that branch \xe2\x80\x94 the president. Yet we want the attorney general to exercise his or her own judgment when we fear presidential wrongdoing. Nixon\xe2\x80\x99s attorney general, Elliot Richardson, and then the acting attorney general who was next in line, William Ruckelshaus, are celebrated for resigning when Nixon ordered them to fire the special prosecutor who was investigating his role in the Watergate break-in. Sessions is already facing questions about his independence for not recusing himself from any F.B.I. investigation of the Trump campaign\xe2\x80\x99s ties to Russia. Because Sessions was an architect of the particular nationalist vision that drives Trump\xe2\x80\x99s approach to policing, voting and immigration, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine what the president (or Bannon) would want to do in those arenas that Sessions would not be ready to defend. Unlike Yates, he is in accord with their aims. He can simply perform the attorney general\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary duties, by doing his utmost to ensure Trump\xe2\x80\x99s orders survive legal scrutiny.'b'What can stop Trump, Bannon and Sessions from using the Justice Department to achieve their goals? So far, judges across the country have prevented Trump from carrying out his refugee and travel ban, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve accepted lawsuits against him for review.'b'Over time, however, more federal judges will be Trump appointees. It\xe2\x80\x99s not just Neil Gorsuch\xe2\x80\x99s nomination to the Supreme Court that\xe2\x80\x99s important for determining the legal fate of Trumpism. Rulings by lower court judges set expectations and establish rationales. Because of the high number of vacancies and older judges, Trump may be able to appoint a greater share of federal judges than any first-term president in 40 years.'b'Judges are supposed to be entirely independent of the president even if he appoints them. The Constitution depends on it. And there are other constraints. The Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s career staff exerts a strong pull toward the center. The public\xe2\x80\x99s restive mood and high level of engagement so far matter, too. It\xe2\x80\x99s no sure thing that Sessions, Bannon and Trump will succeed in carrying out their shared vision. But they\xe2\x80\x99re likely to work together, as long as they\xe2\x80\x99re each in office, to test how far the country will let them go.'b''b''b''b''b''b'L'b'ast summer, early in the morning, I stood out in the main square of Florence to watch the tourists come in. It was quiet. A Zamboni-like street cleaner drove its rounds, leaving wet circles on the paving stones. A vendor unpacked tarp-wrapped souvenirs from the back of his white van. When the crowds began to arrive \xe2\x80\x94 tour groups from Japan, China, Germany, Spain \xe2\x80\x94 they seemed less like people than like weather. They surged into the square, pooling and drifting. They clicked selfies in front of the statues. A small herd of Segways rolled past, one rider singing fake opera at the top of his lungs. I watched a tour group from Arizona (clearly identifiable by their neck badges) approach the white figure of Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s David, towering on a pedestal in front of City Hall. One of the tourists pointed to it and said, in a tone of amused contempt: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s the most famous statue in the world, and they just leave it outside. No big deal \xe2\x80\x94 just hose off the pigeon crap.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The implication was clear: Italy was a backward country, incapable of protecting its cultural treasures. To be fair, the tourist was not the first person to make this accusation. In his history \xe2\x80\x9cThe Italians,\xe2\x80\x9d Luigi Barzini writes that one of the basic pleasures Italy reliably provides for visitors is \xe2\x80\x9cthat of feeling morally superior to the natives.\xe2\x80\x9d I sometimes felt this pleasure myself. The inefficiency of the Italian bureaucracy, whether selling you a postage stamp or fixing a street, was often marvelous to behold. And indeed, the statue the man was pointing at had obviously suffered from standing outside: The marble was striped with dirt.'b'But the tourist was, in one very important respect, wrong.'b'He was pointing not at the actual David but at a full-scale marble replica. Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s real statue did once stand in this spot, but it was moved, for its own protection, 143 years ago. The original is now in a museum across town, shielded from the elements, perfectly safe.'b'Or at least that\xe2\x80\x99s how we like to think of it. We are conditioned to believe that art is safe, beyond the reach of the grimy world. We don\xe2\x80\x99t hang the Mona Lisa next to an archery range. We put her in a fortress: walls, checkpoints, lasers, guards, bulletproof glass. There are scholars, textbooks, posters \xe2\x80\x94 a whole collective mythology suggesting that the work will live forever. But safety is largely an illusion, and permanence a fiction. Empires hemorrhage wealth, bombs fall on cities, religious radicals decimate ancient temples. Destruction happens in any number of ways, for any number of reasons, at any number of speeds \xe2\x80\x94 and it will happen, and no amount of reverence will stop it.'b''b'Few humans on'b' earth know this melancholy truth better than the citizens of Florence. They are born into a profound intimacy with decay. The city was the epicenter of the Renaissance \xe2\x80\x94 home to such art-history superheroes as Giotto, Brunelleschi, Donatello, Cellini and Leonardo da Vinci \xe2\x80\x94 and the relics of that period have been under siege, more or less constantly, ever since. In 1497, the fanatical monk Savonarola sent his followers door to door to gather the city\xe2\x80\x99s nonreligious art, books, clothing, musical instruments, then piled it all 50 feet high in the central square and set it on fire: the infamous Bonfire of the Vanities. (The spectacle was such a success that he repeated it the following year.) In 1895, earthquakes shook Florence so hard that citizens, fearing aftershocks, spent the night sleeping out in the streets. The 20th century brought Nazis and Mafia car bombs. This November will mark the 50th anniversary of the great Florentine flood of 1966, an inundation that overtook much of the city center, killing dozens of people and destroying old masterpieces.'b'Today, the perpetual engine of Florentine destruction seems only to be getting bolder. Its latest target is its most ambitious yet: the mascot of the Renaissance, shining ideal of the human form, one of the most celebrated artworks in this or any other city \xe2\x80\x94 Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s David.'b'The trouble is the David\xe2\x80\x99s ankles. They are cracked. Italians first discovered this weakness back in the 19th century, and modern scientists have mapped the cracks extensively, but until recently no one claimed to know just how enfeebled the ankles might be. This changed in 2014, when a team of Italian geoscientists published a paper called \xe2\x80\x9cModeling the Failure Mechanisms of Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s David Through Small-Scale Centrifuge Experiments.\xe2\x80\x9d That dry title concealed a terrifying story. The paper describes an experiment designed to measure, in a novel way, the weakness in the David\xe2\x80\x99s ankles: by creating a small army of tiny David replicas and spinning them in a centrifuge, at various angles, to simulate different levels of real-world stress. What the researchers found was grim. If the David were to be tilted 15 degrees, his ankles would fail.'b'The seed of the problem is a tiny imperfection in the statue\xe2\x80\x99s design. The center of gravity in the base doesn\xe2\x80\x99t align with the center of gravity in the figure itself; when the base is level, in other words, the David\xe2\x80\x99s body is slightly off-balance. There is, as the article nicely puts it, \xe2\x80\x9can eccentricity of the loads.\xe2\x80\x9d This places extra pressure on the David\xe2\x80\x99s narrowest part: his ankles. As long as the statue is perfectly upright, the eccentricity of the loads is tolerable. But there is very little margin for error. If you tilt the base even slightly, the stress on the ankles sharply increases.'b'Now it just so happens that, for a very long time, before he was moved into his protective museum, the David was leaning slightly. No one is sure exactly why. He stood, for more than 300 years, in the spot where I saw the tourist from Arizona scoff at the dirty replica. Popular legend says the lean was caused by a thunderclap in 1511, part of a violent storm that Florentines interpreted as a bad political omen, but more likely it was a result of the ground shifting slightly, for regular ground-shifting reasons \xe2\x80\x94 something like the force that tilts the famous tower of Pisa or the one that sucks constantly at the city of Venice.'b'For several hundred years, the David leaned at an angle of several degrees. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sound like much, but when you\xe2\x80\x99re dealing with six tons bearing down every second of every minute of every day of every year of every century, it is plenty. Hairline fractures worked their way slowly through the stone. The right leg is significantly worse than the left. As the tilt of the statue increases, the stress will move higher and higher up that leg, until \xe2\x80\x94 at the moment of failure \xe2\x80\x94 it will break off just below the knee.'b'But what would make the David tilt? The big fear is tremors, tremors of all kinds: traffic rumbling, the nearby construction of a high-speed train tunnel, the steady concussion of tourists\xe2\x80\x99 feet and \xe2\x80\x94 most of all \xe2\x80\x94 earthquakes. Florence sits near several active fault lines, and every so often the city takes a seismic hit. In December 2014, a rash of 250 earthquakes rattled the countryside around Florence. Most were minor, and none hit the city directly, but still \xe2\x80\x94 Florentines could feel the motion.'b'My mind could not stop imagining it. An earthquake hits the center of Florence. Liquid waves roll under the rigid city: The church bells ring out of time, terra cotta tiles rain down from the Renaissance rooftops, priceless paintings rattle off the walls of the Uffizi. Meanwhile, inside the Accademia Gallery, the David\xe2\x80\x99s pedestal begins to tilt. Slightly at first, just enough to shift the statue\xe2\x80\x99s gaze, so that he looks not at his old enemy anymore \xe2\x80\x94 the implied Goliath off in the distance \xe2\x80\x94 but at a new one: the floor he\xe2\x80\x99s been standing on for 134 years.'b'As the ground continues to roll, the David\xe2\x80\x99s tilt accelerates. Five degrees, six degrees, seven, eight, nine. Gravity begins to act not just on the top of the David\xe2\x80\x99s head but on his back, pushing him forward. Ten degrees, 11, 12.'b'Finally, the compromised ankles reach their angle of maximum stress. They begin to slide along the old microfracture faults \xe2\x80\x94 an earthquake within the earthquake \xe2\x80\x94 and the David\xe2\x80\x99s legs and ankles are crushed by the weight of the body above. He begins to truly fall.'b'The first thing to hit the floor is his bent left elbow, the arm that holds the heroic sling, and it bursts along the lines of its previous breaks, old scars left over from an incident in the 16th century involving an unruly mob and a bench. Then the rest of the marble will meet the floor, and the physics from there will be fast and simple: force, resistance, the brittleness of calcite crystals, the shearing of microscopic grains along the axes on which they align. Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s David will explode.'b''b'When I first'b' saw the David in person, the only word that came to mind was \xe2\x80\x9cperfect.\xe2\x80\x9d Why hadn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone ever told me he was perfect? I was 20 years old, exhausted, unwashed, traveling for the first time ever, ignorant of almost everything worth knowing. \xe2\x80\x9cPerfect,\xe2\x80\x9d I know now, is not a terribly original response to the statue, nor a very precise one, but in that moment it filled my mind. It felt like a revolution \xe2\x80\x94 urgent, deep, vital, true.'b'Standing in front of the David was, by far, the most powerful experience I had ever had with a work of art. The statue is gigantic: 17 feet tall, three times the size of an actual man, the height of a mature giraffe \xe2\x80\x94 another fact that no one had ever told me. I had always assumed, based on the images, that the David was life-size. To find otherwise seemed like a category error, like arriving at the Taj Mahal to discover that it is actually the size of a walnut. There was an existential snap in my brain, a sudden adjustment of the relative values and proportions of every other object in the world, including me.'b'He towered over me in his iconic pose: back foot flat, front foot tipped, shoulders cocked, left arm raised to hold the sling, huge right hand hanging down by his side, head turned fiercely toward the glorious future. He was a giant marble god, except he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a god; he was a man, but then of course he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really a man either; he was white stone \xe2\x80\x94 but the stone looked somehow soft, like flesh, and the hard-soft marble curved and rippled into muscles and veins, tiny and large, subtle and blunt, each feature easing inevitably into the next, all the way around. My eye kept roaming, looking for imperfections, not finding any. My mind ran in silly loops. The only word it would settle on, again and again, was \xe2\x80\x9cperfect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I stood there in my filthy Birkenstocks feeling a sense of religious transcendental soaring: the promise that my true self was not bound by the constraints of my childhood \xe2\x80\x94 by freeway exits, office parks, after-school programs, coin-operated laundry rooms at dingy apartment complexes, vineyards plowed under and converted into Walmarts, instability, change, dead dogs, divorce. No. The David suggested that my true self existed most fully in some interstellar superhistorical realm in which all the ideal things of the universe commingled in a perpetual ecstasy of harmonizing trumpet blasts. If such perfection could exist in the world, I felt, then so many other things were suddenly possible: to live a perfect life creating perfect things, to find an ideal way to be. What was the point of anything less?'b'Again, I was 20. My girlfriend and I were in the middle of a six-week, shoestring-budget grand tour of Europe. We slept every night in teeming hostels, ate meat with our hands in public parks, frightened people with our terrible German. But it was all worth it for moments like this \xe2\x80\x94 moments in which I could truly believe that perfection was real, as real as a train station a few hours away, and that my life was heading toward it.'b'A huge crowd swarmed around the David, gawking and chatting, but I hardly noticed them. My girlfriend and I stood in the museum for an extremely long time, until the crowds began to thin. Eventually we left and moved on to another museum, another city, and then we went home and \xe2\x80\x94 as the years rolled up their sleeves and marched Americanly by \xe2\x80\x94 we got married, had children, found jobs. I fantasized about perfection while crashing, again and again, into what I discovered were the extremely solid walls of my own limitations. Just on the other side of those walls, I knew, stood the David on his special pedestal: an impossible destination that I was nevertheless determined to reach. But the meeting between my head and that wall began to take up more and more of my attention, and after a while I started to wonder if the perfection on the other side actually existed, if there had ever really been anything there to begin with.'b''b'The David began, 'b'in 1464, with a mistake. Several mistakes, actually. In fact, so many mistakes, and such serious ones, that the whole project seemed to be ruined from the start. The source and precise extent of the mistakes have been disputed over the centuries, but what we know for sure is that none of the mistakes were Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s fault, because he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t born yet. The block that would become the David was cut out of the mountains 11 years before its eventual sculptor\xe2\x80\x99s birth.'b'The first mistake was the stone itself. The marble-cutting community in and around Carrara was, and remains today, practically a sovereign nation, with its own dialect and politics and lore and hierarchies of technical expertise. Michelangelo was a native of the quarrying world, fluent in its ways, but the sculptor who chose the block, Agostino di Duccio, was largely ignorant of them. He had been selected by one of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s most influential groups, the Wool Guild, to carve a monumental marble statue of the biblical David. It would sit high on the edge of the city\xe2\x80\x99s great cathedral, the Duomo, to serve as a show of strength, an artistic boast and a warning to the city\xe2\x80\x99s enemies.'b'But Agostino was in over his head. He had no experience carving marble on this scale \xe2\x80\x94 nobody alive did. The block he chose was huge but flawed. The power of marble, after all, is supposed to be in its perfection: a pure white chunk cut, at almost impossible expense, out of the dirty, ragged mountains. But this slab was marred by little holes, discolored by veins.'b'It was not only Agostino di Duccio who was overmatched \xe2\x80\x94 the quarriers were, too. The block was 18 feet tall and something like 25,000 pounds. No one had harvested a stone this large in close to 1,000 years. The whole process was one ordeal after another. Because statuary marble tends to form up near the tops of mountains, it took months of labor to get it down to the quarry floor. The trip from Carrara to Florence \xe2\x80\x94 an 80-mile journey that takes around two hours in a modern car \xe2\x80\x94 took two more arduous years. There were teams of men, teams of oxen, big ocean ships, flat river barges, inclement weather, monthslong delays. At one point, the giant block fell into a muddy ditch and had to be laboriously extracted. One scholar has speculated that this accident caused the cracks that now plague the ankles.'b'When the block finally arrived in Florence, it was greeted as a wonder. Its size, to the public, would have been more apparent than its imperfections. It was deposited in a courtyard behind the cathedral \xe2\x80\x94 a huge white apparition in the middle of the small brown city. People came from all over just to stare.'b'City leaders went to inspect the block, and they were dismayed. It had not only been badly chosen; it had also been badly carved. Agostino, as was traditional, had \xe2\x80\x9croughed out\xe2\x80\x9d the block at the quarry \xe2\x80\x94 a quick whittling down to leave only what was necessary for the eventual statue. In doing so, however, he had compounded his previous mistake. The block had been strangely narrow to begin with, and Agostino had made it even narrower. He created an awkward hole in its middle. It was hard to see how this stone was ever going to become a plausible human form. Some believed that it was ruined, that the city\xe2\x80\x99s investment was already lost.'b'Agostino was fired. The block was abandoned. It sat there, on its side, getting rained on, hailed on, fouled by birds, for more than 30 years. After a while, it became a fixed part of the landscape of Florence. People and buildings changed all around it, regimes rose and fell, but the monumental block never moved. Residents began to call it, with some mixture of respect and mockery, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Giant.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get back to Florence, after my initial visit, for nearly 20 years. When I did finally return, it was as an adult man on the brink of middle age. I was not quite 40 but felt, in many ways, older. My hair, once as heroically thick as the David\xe2\x80\x99s, had begun to thin visibly, and I felt sad about this, and I also considered my sadness to be its own failure, because I wanted to be the kind of person who didn\xe2\x80\x99t care about superficial, middle-age things. Every morning, when I stepped out of bed, my joints hurt, especially my ankles, which a doctor had recently diagnosed with arthritis \xe2\x80\x94 they were 20 years older than the rest of me, he said.'b'My youthful pursuit of David-like perfection had gone, shall we say, not terribly well. I had turned out to be a strange person, not anything like an ideal. My life was littered with awkwardnesses, estrangements, mutual disillusionments, abandoned projects. Recently, I had begun to notice an odd tic in my interpersonal style \xe2\x80\x94 a problem with my gaze. I would be speaking with someone, a friend or a shopkeeper, all very normally ('b'how are you good thanks how are you how\xe2\x80\x99s your summer'b'), and then, for no discernible reason, my eyes would dart away from my interlocutor, urgently, right over one of his or her shoulders, and the shift would be so sudden that the person would whip his or her head around to see what on earth I was looking at \xe2\x80\x94 a policeman or an exotic bird or a runaway train \xe2\x80\x94 but it would turn out that there was nothing there at all. My gaze had been flicked away by a little spasm of social discomfort. And so the person would look back at me, confused, and I would manage to hold his or her gaze for another few seconds until the social energy built back up between us to an intolerable level, at which point I would suddenly break the circuit again by looking away \xe2\x80\x94 and the person would look, one more time, back over his or her shoulder to confirm that nothing was there, and then our relationship would be altered forever.'b'Perfection, it turns out, is no way to try to live. It is a child\xe2\x80\x99s idea, a cartoon \xe2\x80\x94 this desire not to be merely good, not to do merely well, but to be faultless, to transcend everything, including the limits of yourself. It is less heroic than neurotic, and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t take much analysis to get to its ugly side: a lust for control, pseudofascist purity, self-destruction. Perfection makes you flinch at yourself, flinch at the world, flinch at any contact between the two. Soon what you want, above all, is escape: to be gone, elsewhere, annihilated.'b'By the time I returned to Florence, I had grown accustomed to spending solid weeks in a state of high anxiety \xe2\x80\x94 my hands would turn freezing, like a corpse, and I would sit at my desk wishing I could cry, and my wife would tell me, with increasing urgency, that she was afraid I was going to have a heart attack. Eventually, after many years of this, I was prescribed a daily pill intended to stabilize an imbalance in my brain chemistry, and this solution has worked, more or less. Yet I am still plagued by this eccentricity of the loads: an impossible tension between the fantasies in my head and the realities on the ground.'b'And so, on my bad ankles and with my broken gaze, I returned to see the David. Things in Florence seemed essentially the same. Crowds still waited for hours in the brutal heat to enter the churchlike museum. Inside, the David stood exactly as I last saw him. I experienced the same moment of revelation: the sudden improbability of his size, his excellence. He still dominated the space, still held the light on his impossibly subtle musculature. In fact, he was looking better than ever, because in the intervening years he had been cleaned, millimeter by millimeter, at great expense and with some controversy \xe2\x80\x94 the grit and dust of 500 years scrubbed off. The marble seemed to glow. Once again, my brain reached for the word \xe2\x80\x9cperfect.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But \xe2\x80\x9cperfect\xe2\x80\x9d no longer seemed adequate. Although I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see the cracks inside the David\xe2\x80\x99s ankles and legs, I knew they were there. I knew other things too: that the marble of his face was pocked with holes, for instance, which restorers had filled in, and that he was missing a small chip of stone from one of his lower eyelids, and that his right little toe had been lost multiple times, and that a crazy man had taken a hammer to his left foot in 1991. Although the David\xe2\x80\x99s maladies were mostly patched up over the centuries, you could still see all the scars.'b''b'In the year'b' 1501, amid fresh political spasms, the leaders of Florence decided to rehabilitate the Giant. But who could possibly save it? There was some talk of giving the project to Leonardo da Vinci, the city\xe2\x80\x99s (and Europe\xe2\x80\x99s) reigning genius. But Leonardo was an intellectual, nearly 50 years old, who openly disdained the process of sculpture \xe2\x80\x94 that sweaty blunt hacking at stone. In the end, the commission went to a less famous Florentine, Michelangelo Buonarroti, a 26-year-old eccentric who had just made his reputation in Rome by carving a marble Piet\xc3\xa0 for St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 a statue of astonishing grace and maturity and polish. Michelangelo hurried home to take the commission.'b'The first step had been to stand the Giant up. This, in itself, was a production. Once again, all of Florence came out to watch. The block had been sitting there for 35 years, almost the entire life expectancy of a 16th-century human, and it was now in worse shape than ever. Marble is best to carve when it is freshly cut from the mountain. The longer it sits out, the more brittle it becomes. The Giant was now thoroughly \xe2\x80\x9ccooked,\xe2\x80\x9d in the local parlance \xe2\x80\x94 dried out by decades of sun. Some people said it was beyond salvaging. Many wanted to attach extra marble blocks to it. They said it would be impossible to get a proper figure out of the misshapen mess that was left. This would become one of the feats that would elevate Michelangelo to mythic status: that he not only salvaged the ruined block but also turned it into a masterpiece. As the Renaissance art historian Giorgio Vasari put it: \xe2\x80\x9cAnd truly it was a miracle on the part of Michelangelo to restore to life a thing that was dead.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The miracle took some time. First, Michelangelo decided that he needed to carve the David in private, so workers came and built a roofless shed around the Giant. For many months, inside his shed, Michelangelo toiled away unseen, using a series of finer and finer chisels in an attempt to rescue every centimeter of the stone. He was a savant of marble, so he would have understood everything about the block, all of its grains and flaws and possibilities. The figure of the David began to emerge little by little, as A. Victor Coonin puts it in his definitive recent history of the statue, \xe2\x80\x9cFrom Marble to Flesh,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clike a person being slowly revealed as water drains from a bath.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When the shed was finally opened for a public viewing, in the summer of 1503, the David really must have seemed like a miracle. The dirty old cooked Giant had become a smooth, enormous, naked man, paused just on the brink of heroic motion. The young sculptor had not run from the odd dimensions of the block; he embraced them, turning them into his figure\xe2\x80\x99s signature elements. The block\xe2\x80\x99s narrowness yielded the lean, twisting body (as opposed to an overmuscled superman), with its huge head and hands. Michelangelo gave the David a grotesquely furrowed brow \xe2\x80\x94 a shelf of a forehead closer to a Neanderthal\xe2\x80\x99s than a modern human\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 because he knew that anything more \xe2\x80\x9crealistic\xe2\x80\x9d would fail to scan for a viewer on the ground. The figure was unreal but real, stylized but natural. It would come to define the city.'b'A debate raged over where to put the David. The statue was so powerful, so impressive, that it seemed a waste (and perhaps even impossible, engineeringwise) to install it in its intended destination, way up on the cathedral. Instead, after rounds of conferences among the Florentine intelligentsia, it was decided that the sculpture would be installed in the city\xe2\x80\x99s central square, the Piazza della Signoria, where everyone could see it. A special machine had to be invented to move it: a huge wooden frame inside of which the David was suspended in a net of ropes, rocking gently, as a crew of men rolled it across the city on greased beams. At night, it had to be protected by armed guards from rowdy kids who were throwing rocks at it.'b'The David\xe2\x80\x99s journey took four days, at the end of which it was installed, to much fanfare, out in the public square. It would stand in that same spot for the next 369 years, a period during which it would be shaken by thunder, hit by carts and smeared with bird feces. In 1527, a riotous mob tried to storm City Hall, and another mob, in defense of the public order, threw heavy objects out the windows: stones, tiles, furniture. A bench hit the David, breaking his left arm in half.'b'Michelangelo went off to Rome, where he painted the Sistine Chapel; designed the dome of St. Peter\xe2\x80\x99s Basilica, at the time the largest in the history of the world; and eventually died, wealthy and famous beyond measure, at age 88. He would never see his David again.'b'The Giant continued its slow decline. Although the broken arm was eventually mended and reattached, the statue remained outside, exposed to rain, ice, hail, wind and vandals. Its surface began to visibly degrade. In the 19th century, the statue\xe2\x80\x99s restorers tended only to make things worse \xe2\x80\x94 they used wax, which discolored the marble, and acid, which ate at its surface. Before long, the David needed restoring from his restoration. A broken rain gutter on the Palazzo Vecchio poured torrents of water directly onto the statue. Concerned citizens began to agitate for him to be moved indoors. They built a protective wooden shed over him, isolating him in a bubble of safety. This brought the public life of the David full circle. He was carved in a shed; he was hidden in a shed.'b'Eventually, the statue\xe2\x80\x99s protectors were able to move him, on train tracks laid laboriously across Florence, to a custom-built room in the Accademia. But the room still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t finished, so the David sat inside a crate for years, growing colonies of microorganisms like a huge piece of cheese.'b'The Accademia attracts well over a million visitors a year, and they all end up in one room: the David\xe2\x80\x99s rotunda. I stood there, in the summer of 2015, watching the crowd watch the David.'b'The air in the room was perfectly still. The tourists fanned themselves with maps of Florence. Guides, speaking directly into their followers\xe2\x80\x99 ears via head-mounted microphones, led large groups into the center of the crowd like battalions into battle. I watched a woman take a short nap while leaning against a stone column. A couple from Holland sat down next to me and fired streams of Dutch at each other, the only word of which I could make out was the English \xe2\x80\x9csix-pack.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most of all, people took pictures. For almost its entire history, the Accademia has been a strict no-camera zone, but the rise of smartphones made that impossible, and now the phones have taken over. Tourists spend their time in front of the three-dimensional David poking a two-dimensional version of him on their touch screens. I witnessed the execution of many, many selfies: the jockeying for a proper angle, the sudden dead-eyed smile, the brisk walk away. (There always seemed to be something furtive, something almost criminal, about a selfie.) Often, through a trick of perspective, the selfie-taker\xe2\x80\x99s own head would appear on the screen twice as big as the David.'b'The most popular target for photographers was the David\xe2\x80\x99s genitals. People were obsessed with them. I watched a very American man (Tommy Hilfiger shirt, Oakley sunglasses, BMW baseball hat) pretend to cup the statue\xe2\x80\x99s testicles while his wife took his picture \xe2\x80\x94 and then his wife pretended to cup the David\xe2\x80\x99s testicles while he took'b' her'b' picture. Two women posed for a photo pretending to hold the David\xe2\x80\x99s penis simultaneously, as if it were a trophy fish. A serious man touch-focused his iPhone camera, with delicate precision, on the David\xe2\x80\x99s foreskin.'b'At the back of the crowd, I found the David\xe2\x80\x99s security guard. He sat sideways on a folding chair, chin in hand, a model of relaxed uninterest; he seemed to watch the room without even looking. When he spoke, his mustache moved over a mouth that was missing several teeth. He was a native Florentine, and he told me stories about crazy tourists (weeping, thongs) and about the great flood of 1966, in which his family\xe2\x80\x99s house was underwater up to the second floor.'b'I asked him if, after all this time, he had any personal feeling of awe left for the David. He said he did not.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf you eat chocolate every day for 20 years,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will get bored of it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'If looking at Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s David is the equivalent of eating chocolate, then walking the streets of Florence is like drowning in Willy Wonka\xe2\x80\x99s gushing chocolate river. The image of the David is everywhere. There are bookmarks, mouse pads, T-shirts, posters, watches, key chains, mugs, ballpoint pens, commemorative plates, pie servers, snow globes, sugar spoons, USB sticks and Christmas ornaments. There are leather shops and pizzerias and even parking garages named after him. Tourists can buy aprons that make them look as if they have the David\xe2\x80\x99s body: the lean, muscular torso, the naked little penis.'b'And then there are the statuettes: a vast army of miniature imitation Davids that stand in shop windows and on hawkers\xe2\x80\x99 carts in all the famous piazzas. Near the Accademia I found a store called, in English, \xe2\x80\x9cDavid Shop.\xe2\x80\x9d It was a David-replica bonanza, more Davids than I have ever seen in one place before. The smallest was the size of my pinkie, the biggest slightly taller than an average Italian woman. I bought a postcard that was also a jigsaw puzzle featuring the David\xe2\x80\x99s penis wearing sunglasses and saying \xe2\x80\x9cCiao!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Next to the Duomo, for an exorbitant price, I bought a bobblehead David; his giant head, attached by a spring, waggled ridiculously as I walked. He waggled past many other versions of himself \xe2\x80\x94 hundreds, thousands, infinity Davids. From a distance, many of the replicas looked acceptably David-like, but up close most of them were laughably bad. The replicas are like a systematic exploration of all the possible ways to distort Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s design. Their faces are squashed, their heads are flat, their noses are pointed, they look like goblins. Some of them seem to have breasts. Others have rib cages jutting out in high relief, like cartoons of shipwreck survivors. One shop-window David stood several feet tall and cost more than $200 \xe2\x80\x94 a serious investment that would have taken up major space in any buyer\xe2\x80\x99s home. Its face looked like a bug-eyed, emaciated elf\xe2\x80\x99s. Its muscles were lumpy and gnarled. Its feet were long and bony, like the feet of an ancient witch in a fairy tale. Its hair looked like a pile of spaghetti. It seemed more a parody of the David than a tribute.'b'In the Accademia gift shop, I bought a sticker that read, simply, \xe2\x80\x9cDAVID MANIA.\xe2\x80\x9d This, I decided, was the epitome of David souvenirs \xe2\x80\x94 a tribute not to the actual David but to our mass enthusiasm for him.'b'Sometimes, when I found myself fed up with Florence and its crowds, overwhelmed by the kitsch, the heat, the vendors, the constant eruptions of Renaissance cosplay, my walks took me across the river, away from the old bridge, toward a plain yellow building with a stationery shop on its ground floor. Twenty feet up, where no one ever seemed to look, was a small historical plaque identifying it as the temporary home of the great Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky. This is where he agonized over the writing of his novel \xe2\x80\x9cThe Idiot,\xe2\x80\x9d which I was rereading. Dostoyevsky was, in many ways, the anti-David: ugly, short, hairy, awkward, nervous, ill, angry, a prophet of spite and self-sabotage. I found him incredibly inspiring. He spoke to me beyond the kitsch, above the crowds, from the other side of my old simplistic understanding of the David. He gestured toward something more complex, more inclusive, more sustainable.'b'Dostoyevsky moved to Florence with his wife in 1868, during a miserable swing through Europe, and he detested the city at times with a degree of comic loathing that only he could have mustered for such a beautiful place. He complained about the humidity, the rain, the crowds, the heat. He never learned Italian, preferring to sit in his room, alone, wrestling with his novel. He stayed, for nearly a year, only because he was too poor to leave \xe2\x80\x94 he had compulsively blown much of his money at the roulette tables of Europe.'b'As I looked at the David, I thought about \xe2\x80\x9cThe Idiot,\xe2\x80\x9d and as I read \xe2\x80\x9cThe Idiot,\xe2\x80\x9d I thought about the David. They existed at opposite poles, and yet they also spoke deeply to each other. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Idiot\xe2\x80\x9d was Dostoyevsky\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to create an ideal man, a modern Christ \xe2\x80\x94 what he called \xe2\x80\x9ca completely beautiful human being.\xe2\x80\x9d He was forced to try to write this perfect book, however, in humiliatingly imperfect conditions: isolated far from home, in intense poverty and grief \xe2\x80\x94 the Dostoyevskys\xe2\x80\x99 young daughter had died just months earlier \xe2\x80\x94 and delayed by fits of epilepsy. Up in his cramped apartment above the paper store, Dostoyevsky flogged his unruly book. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Idiot\xe2\x80\x9d is full of wild crowds bursting into rooms out of nowhere. Its plot is strange, lurching, unbalanced. Its hero is seen by everyone as a fool, and his presence seems to cause trouble wherever he goes. The book is, in both theme and execution, one of the great artistic statements of the impossibility of human perfection. Rereading it during the visit to Florence made me feel, somehow, spiritually itchy.'b'Unlike Michelangelo, Dostoyevsky was missing from the official lore of the city \xe2\x80\x94 you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t buy postcards bearing his image or visit a museum devoted to his life and work. This made him even more of a refuge, a small secret I shared with no one.'b''b'One afternoon'b' I walked into a part of the Accademia that most people never see, down a labyrinth of staircases and hallways, to a small office tucked into the very back of the building. This belonged to Angelo Tartuferi, director of the museum \xe2\x80\x94 the official protector of the David. The walls were hung with medieval paintings. Tartuferi wore a green Umbro polo shirt. He was relaxed, animated, candid; he spoke in long streams of Italian punctuated occasionally by roars of laughter.'b'We talked about the David\xe2\x80\x99s cracked ankles, a topic with which Tartuferi was very familiar.'b'I asked him about the geoscientists\xe2\x80\x99 terrifying paper. He rolled his eyes. It was, he said, mainly a publicity grab: We have known about these cracks for more than 100 years, he pointed out, and they aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting any worse. The David is now perfectly upright, and he is one of the most closely monitored artworks in the world. There are maps not only of the cracks themselves but also of every stain and blemish on the surface of the marble, of every repair that has ever been made, even of the patterns in which dust tends to fall. Visitors to the Accademia will notice a large, inelegant plastic brick mounted behind the David to monitor all of its vital signs: temperature, motion, angle of inclination. It is labeled \xe2\x80\x9cSMARTBRICK. New. Fast. Easy. Smart.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Tartuferi conceded, however, that he was still worried about an earthquake. Sometimes he had bad dreams. All of that high-tech monitoring can only warn us \xe2\x80\x94 it can\xe2\x80\x99t protect anything. And while it seems to be true that the cracks aren\xe2\x80\x99t getting worse, they are not getting better either. As long as they exist, the David will be vulnerable.'b'What, then, is to be done? In fact, a relatively simple solution to the ankle problem already exists. Although we can\xe2\x80\x99t fix the cracks, we can mitigate the stress that makes them dangerous. There is a special kind of antiseismic base that allows a marble statue to move along with any tectonic disturbance. It\xe2\x80\x99s similar to the kind of technology you\xe2\x80\x99d find under buildings in San Francisco. Many less illustrious statues in earthquake zones are already protected by such bases. They are not terribly complex and, considering the potential consequences of leaving it undone, not terribly expensive: about 250,000 euros, according to Tartuferi, a tiny fraction of the revenues the David earns the museum in a single year.'b'In 2014, after the earthquakes rocked the countryside around Florence, after the global media fretted about the possible destruction of the David, Italy\xe2\x80\x99s minister of culture said that an antiseismic base would be installed under the statue within a year. But a year passed, and nothing happened. When I arrived in the summer of 2015 \xe2\x80\x94 six months after that statement \xe2\x80\x94 I half-expected to find men in hard hats working around the David\xe2\x80\x99s pedestal. Instead, there were only the usual tourists. The David, meanwhile, stood there in his old precarious rigidity, vulnerable as ever to the tremors.'b'I asked Tartuferi what was happening with the antiseismic base.'b'The delay was only bureaucratic, he said. He had met, long ago, with a company that did this sort of stabilizing work. Tartuferi had told the Italian press that the job was underway. The base could, hypothetically, go in at any moment.'b'But the Italian government, Tartuferi said, refused to allow him to install the base. The nation was in the middle of an elaborate restructuring of its museum system, and it was planning to put new leaders \xe2\x80\x94 some of whom would be known as \xe2\x80\x9csupermanagers\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 into Florence\xe2\x80\x99s highest-profile (and therefore most lucrative) museums. This made Tartuferi a lame-duck director, and the Italian government was not going to allow him, on his way out the door, to execute a project as important as saving the David. Italy, in the midst of its own economic collapse, wanted to be the hero that stepped forward to save the David from collapsing.'b'The problem was that no one could say exactly when this power transfer might occur, and \xe2\x80\x94 even after it did \xe2\x80\x94 if and when the base would be installed. When Tartuferi departed, he told me, he was planning to pass the project of the antiseismic base off to his successor. This, he said, is what the new director would have to deal with first.'b'Meanwhile, every day, the David would remain at risk. In fact, Tartuferi told me, the high-tech monitoring device on the back of the David\xe2\x80\x99s pedestal, the smart brick, had recently been turned off. There was no point in monitoring anymore, he said \xe2\x80\x94 everyone knew what needed to be done. Now they just needed to do it.'b'Tartuferi was not the only one who told me a story like this. I met with a woman named Contessa Simonetta Brandolini d\xe2\x80\x99Adda, one of the most powerful figures in Florence\xe2\x80\x99s art world. Eighteen years ago, the contessa founded a nonprofit organization called Friends of Florence, which has financed and overseen the restoration of many of the city\xe2\x80\x99s endangered masterpieces, from sculptures in the central square to Botticelli oil paintings in the Uffizi to 15th-century Mannerist frescoes in a popular local church. The organization fills a crucial lack in Italy, helping to make up for the increasingly cash-strapped government\xe2\x80\x99s inability to take proper care of its decaying cultural heritage. In 2004, Friends of Florence raised half a million dollars to help fund the cleaning and restoration of the David, and they continue to pay for the statue\xe2\x80\x99s regular monitoring and upkeep. A family of spiders, Brandolini told me, had been discovered living in the giant caverns of the David\xe2\x80\x99s hair. Every few months they covered his body with dusty webs that needed to be vacuumed off.'b'Friends of Florence would dearly love to raise the funds to pay for the David\xe2\x80\x99s antiseismic base. But the Italian government, again and again, has insisted that the state will take care of it. It seemed they believed that an outside organization rescuing the David would be improper. She was an even-keeled and practical woman, but while relating this to me, she grew visibly frustrated. There was simply nothing she could do against the overwhelming force of official Italian national pride.'b''b'Destruction takes many'b' forms, not just the sudden apocalyptic crash or the long-term degradation of rain and ice and wind. There is death by inaction, death by neglect. There is also death by reverence, death by ubiquity, death by subtle retail-shop humiliation. The David\xe2\x80\x99s superfame struck me as another eccentricity of the loads: the tension between the actual statue \xe2\x80\x94 the original physical thing, unique in the world \xe2\x80\x94 and the statue\xe2\x80\x99s ubiquitous image. The thing itself was hopelessly outnumbered by its own reproductions. We knew the David so well, and our own knowledge of our knowledge of that image, that we could hardly see the David at all.'b'There was a part of me \xe2\x80\x94 a part I never mentioned to the museum directors or the contessa or anyone else in Florence \xe2\x80\x94 that was titillated by the possibility of the David falling over. It was a perverse, adolescent, iconoclastic streak, a dark troll that lived under the otherwise more-or-less serviceable bridge of my conscious mind. It was something like what Freud called the death drive: an urge toward failure and collapse, especially of the things we want most in life. If perfection in life truly isn\xe2\x80\x99t possible, croaked my troll \xe2\x80\x94 and it isn\xe2\x80\x99t! 'b'It isn\xe2\x80\x99t!'b' \xe2\x80\x94 then perhaps we should move on to the relative perfection of destruction.'b'My inner troll worshiped not the David but the cracks in the David\xe2\x80\x99s ankles. They were, as a fatal flaw, so deliciously humiliating \xe2\x80\x94 such a perfectly ironic undercutting of the statue\xe2\x80\x99s otherwise heroic stature. The David\xe2\x80\x99s destiny, said my troll, was not to stand but to break.'b'This put me in mind, once again, of Dostoyevsky \xe2\x80\x94 the grumpy outcast seething in Florence, the anti-David. My troll could easily have been one of his characters. It could have been the splenetic narrator of \xe2\x80\x9cNotes From Underground,\xe2\x80\x9d who recoils against the notion of rational utopia, of the perfectibility of mankind: \xe2\x80\x9cTwo times two is four is no longer life, gentlemen, but the beginning of death.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The real power of Dostoyevsky\xe2\x80\x99s work, though, is that despite all the misery his characters endure, his vision is not actually miserable. It is redemptive, celebratory, powerfully totalizing. Humans are compulsive, irrational and petty, yes, but they are also selfless, intelligent and idealistic. In Dostoyevsky, there is a radical acceptance that strikes me as, in its own way, a new, more perfect vision of perfection: an envelope of understanding that can hold the entire universe.'b'I began to think of the David not as a traditional hero but as a Dostoyevsky character. Like the Idiot, he was an ideal man with no real place in the world \xe2\x80\x94 misunderstood, assaulted by crowds, drawn into all sorts of unheroic shenanigans. There was, God knows, much that was insane about our relationship to the statue: the compulsive selfies, the inertia of the Italian bureaucracy, the DAVID MANIA. But as a character in \xe2\x80\x9cThe Idiot\xe2\x80\x9d puts it: \xe2\x80\x9cTo attain perfection, one must first of all be able not to understand many things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As I walked around Florence, I was exposed to hundreds and thousands of horrible David replicas. At a certain point, I began to actually love them. They were so awkward, so bad and so numerous, that they were, in the aggregate, somehow good \xe2\x80\x94 a perfect tribute to Michelangelo\xe2\x80\x99s strange genius, and to the gnarled history of the statue itself. They were, themselves, little trolls: the David\xe2\x80\x99s imperfections made flesh, sprung fully formed out of the cracks in his ankles and set loose upon the world.'b'At home, on my mantle, I keep a small crowd of them: a green one, the bobblehead, a white one that looks like an elf. One of them, a tiny keychain, recently fell over and broke \xe2\x80\x94 his head cracked clean off. I keep its pieces there with the rest.'b''b'A month after'b' I met with him, Angelo Tartuferi was removed from his position as director of the Accademia. The antiseismic-base project, needless to say, had not yet commenced. Tartuferi\xe2\x80\x99s replacement was one of Florence\xe2\x80\x99s new so-called supermanagers, a medieval scholar from Germany named Cecilie Hollberg. I met her in June, at a lush hotel bar overlooking the Arno River. I had expected someone stern and formal, but Hollberg was, in fact, relaxed and unpretentious and congenial, with a sly humor that rushed into all the gaps in our conversation. She seemed perpetually amused to have been plucked out of her small German town and imported to watch over the most famous statue in the world. She referred to the David, jokingly, as her husband. We drank spritzes and had a wonderful time.'b'I asked Hollberg about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s ankles. Had there been any progress, under her watch, on the David\xe2\x80\x99s antiseismic base? This was six months after Hollberg took charge and a year and a half after the culture minister\xe2\x80\x99s initial promise to place the David on the base.'b'There had not been any progress. Hollberg, in fact, seemed surprisingly calm. After all, an earthquake was still hypothetical, and she had inherited plenty of other, more pressing problems. There were holes in the museum\xe2\x80\x99s roof that let rainwater through. There were illegal vendors who hassled the tourists while they waited outside in line. There was the problem of finding space, in the clotted center of Florence, to expand the undersized museum.'b'After her arrival, Hollberg said, people emerged from everywhere to tell her how to save the David. Everyone claimed to be an expert. Everyone seemed to have something to sell. But Hollberg wanted to take her time, to consider all the options. She wanted the right solution, not just the fastest or easiest. At some point in the future, she said, she would probably travel to Los Angeles to consult experts at the Getty Center about how they protect their statues.'b'In the meantime, Hollberg said, if a major earthquake were to hit Florence directly, every museum in the city would endure some destruction, not just the Accademia. I found this, somehow, not comforting at all. For now, and for the foreseeable future, we would just have to trust the David to keep standing.'b''b''b''b''b''b'I'b'n a world as unmannerly as this one, how is it best to speak?'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to be rude, I say to the man in the packed hall at passport control. There are people everywhere, and his job is to send them into the right queues. I have been watching him shout at them. I have watched the obsessive way he notices them, to pick on them. There\xe2\x80\x99s no need to be rude, I say.'b'His head jerks around.'b'You\xe2\x80\x99re rude, he counters. You\xe2\x80\x99re the one who\xe2\x80\x99s rude.'b'This is an airport, a place of transit. There are all sorts of people here, people of different ages, races and nationalities, people in myriad sets of circumstances. In this customs hall, there are so many different versions of living that it seems possible that no one version could ever be agreed on. Does it follow, then, that nothing that happens here really matters?'b'No, I\xe2\x80\x99m not, I say.'b'You are, he says. You\xe2\x80\x99re being rude.'b'The man is wearing a uniform, though not a very impressive one: a white short-sleeved synthetic shirt, black synthetic trousers, a cheap tie with the airport\xe2\x80\x99s insignia on it. It is no different from the uniform a bus driver might wear, or someone at a car-rental desk, someone who lacks any meaningful authority while also being forced into constant interaction with members of the public, someone for whom the operation of character is both nothing and everything. He is angry. His face is red, and his expression is unpleasant. He looks at me \xe2\x80\x94 a woman of 48 traveling alone, a woman who doubtless exhibits some signs of the privileged life she has led \xe2\x80\x94 with loathing. Apparently it is I, not he, who has broken the social code. Apparently it was rude of me to accuse him of rudeness.'b'The social code remains unwritten, and it has always interested me how many problems this poses in the matter of ascertaining the truth. The truth often appears in the guise of a threat to the social code. It has this in common with rudeness. When people tell the truth, they can experience a feeling of release from pretense that is perhaps similar to the release of rudeness. It might follow that people can mistake truth for rudeness, and rudeness for truth. It may only be by examining the aftermath of each that it becomes possible to prove which was which.'b'The queue moves forward. I reach passport control, and I pass through it, and the man is left behind.'b''b'In recounting this incident'b' afterward, I find myself running into difficulties. For instance, I find myself relying on the details of the man\xe2\x80\x99s physical ugliness to prove the badness of his character. Searching for a specific example of someone else\xe2\x80\x99s being upset or offended by him, the only person I can prove he offended was me. On another day, a perfectly polite man is probably to be found directing the crowds in the customs hall, assisting the elderly, apologizing for the crush, helpfully explaining things to people whose English is uncertain: He would make a good story about individuality as the basis for all hope.'b'By telling this story, I am trying to substantiate my fear that discrimination and bullying are used against people trying to enter Britain, my country. There are many people who don\xe2\x80\x99t have this fear. To them, my story proves only one thing, which is that I once met a rude man in an airport. I might even have inadvertently made them pity him. I, the teller of this tale, would have to demonstrate that under the same circumstances, I would have behaved better. In the event, all I did was criticize him. I made him angrier; perhaps he took it out on the next person in the queue. To top it all off, I admit that he accuses me of precisely the same failing: rudeness. Anyone hearing the story will at this point stop thinking about the moral problem of rudeness and start thinking about me. I have damaged my own narrative authority: Might I be to blame after all? By including that detail \xe2\x80\x94 true though it is \xe2\x80\x94 I am giving the man a platform for his point of view. In most of my stories, I allow the truth to look after itself. In this one, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that it can.'b'For all these reasons, the story doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work as it should. Why, then, if it proves nothing, is this a story I persist in telling? The answer: because I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, and I feel that the thing I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand about it \xe2\x80\x94 indeed the mere fact of not understanding \xe2\x80\x94 is significant.'b''b'Another day, another airport. 'b'This time the situation is clearer: My country has recently voted to leave the European Union, and rudeness is rampant. People treat one another with a contempt that they do not trouble to conceal. The people in uniforms \xe2\x80\x94 the airport officials \xe2\x80\x94 exercise their faux power with uncommon ugliness, while the rest of us look suspiciously at one another, not sure what to expect of this new, unscripted reality, wondering which side the other person is on. It is already being said that this situation has arisen out of hatred, but it seems to me that if that is true, then the hatred is of self.'b'The uniformed woman at security bangs the gray plastic trays one after another onto the conveyor belt with a violence that seems to be a request for attention. At every opportunity, she makes it clear that she has relinquished self-control: Her nature has been let loose, like an animal from its cage. She abuses, without exception, every person who passes along her queue, while seeming not to address any single one of them: We are no longer individuals; we are a herd enduring the drover\xe2\x80\x99s lash, heads down and silent. She looks unhealthy, her face covered with sore-looking red spots, her shapeless white body almost writhing with its own anger, as though it wishes only to transgress its boundaries, to escape itself in an act of brutality.'b'The person in front of me in the queue is a well-groomed black woman. She is traveling with a child, a pretty girl with neatly plaited hair. She has put two large clear bags of cosmetics and creams in her tray, but this, apparently, is not allowed; she is permitted only a single bag. The uniformed woman halts the queue and slowly and deliberately holds up the two bags, looking fixedly at their owner.'b'What\xe2\x80\x99s this then? she says. What\xe2\x80\x99s this about?'b'The woman explains that because two of them are traveling, she has assumed that they are entitled to two bags. Her voice is quiet and polite. The little girl gazes ahead with wide, unblinking eyes.'b'You assumed wrong, the uniformed woman says. Her horrible relish for the situation is apparent. She has been waiting, it is clear, to fasten on someone and has found her victim.'b'You don\xe2\x80\x99t get away with that, she says, grimacing and shaking her head. Where do people like you get your ideas from?'b'The rest of us watch while she makes the woman unpack the bags and then decide which of her possessions are to be thrown away. They are mostly new and expensive-looking. In another situation, their scented femininity might have seemed to mock the ugliness of the woman superintending their destruction with folded arms and a jeering expression on her face. The other woman\xe2\x80\x99s slender, varnished fingers are shaking as she scrabbles with the various pots and jars. She keeps dropping things, her head bowed, her lower lip caught in her teeth. The uniformed woman\xe2\x80\x99s unremitting commentary on these events is so unpleasant that I realize she is half-demented with what would seem to be the combination of power and powerlessness. No one intervenes. I do not inform her that there is no need to be rude. Instead, as I increasingly seem to in such situations these days, I wonder what Jesus would have done.'b'My traveling companion \xe2\x80\x94 a painter \xe2\x80\x94 is the politest person I know, but I have noticed that he does not often take up arms on another person\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. He dislikes conflict. When it is our turn in the queue, the uniformed woman stares at the bag he has placed in the tray. It contains his tubes of paint. They are crumpled and bespattered with use, and there are so many of them that the bag can\xe2\x80\x99t close at the top. She folds her arms.'b'What are those, she says.'b'They\xe2\x80\x99re paints, he replies.'b'You can\xe2\x80\x99t take those through, she says.'b'Why not, he asks pleasantly.'b'The bag has to close at the top, she says. That\xe2\x80\x99s why not.'b'But I need them to paint with, he says.'b'You can\xe2\x80\x99t take them through, she says.'b'He looks at her in silence. He is looking directly into her eyes. He stands completely quiet and still. The look goes on for a very long time. Her eyes are small and pale blue and impotent: I did not notice them until now. My friend neither blinks nor looks away, and the woman is forced to hold herself there as the seconds tick by, her small eyes open and straining. During those seconds, it seems as if layers of her are being removed: She is being simplified, put in order, by being looked at. He is giving her his full attention, and I watch the strange transformation occur. Finally he speaks.'b'What do you suggest I do, he says, very calmly.'b'Well, sir, she says, if you\xe2\x80\x99re traveling with this lady, she might have room in her bag.'b'Neither of them looks at me \xe2\x80\x94 they are still looking at each other.'b'Would that be acceptable? she says.'b'Yes, he says, I don\xe2\x80\x99t see why not.'b'I proffer my bag, and the woman herself transfers the paints from one bag to the other. Her hands labor to do it with care and exactitude: It takes her a long time. Finally she seals the bag and lays it gently back in the tray.'b'Is that all right, sir? she says.'b'Now that he has won this victory, I want him to use it to reprimand her, not just for her behavior toward the black woman in the queue but for all the wrongs her behavior represents; for the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s safer to be him, and always has been. He does not reprimand her. He smiles at her politely.'b'Thank you very much, he says.'b'It would have been a shame to throw them away, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it? she says.'b'Yes, it would, he says. I appreciate your help.'b'I hope you enjoy your holiday, sir, she says.'b''b'Society organizes itself 'b'very efficiently to punish, silence or disown truth-tellers. Rudeness, on the other hand, is often welcomed in the manner of a false god. Later still, regret at the punishment of the truth-teller can build into powerful feelings of worship, whereas rudeness will be disowned.'b'Are people rude because they are unhappy? Is rudeness like nakedness, a state deserving the tact and mercy of the clothed? If we are polite to rude people, perhaps we give them back their dignity; yet the obsessiveness of the rude presents certain challenges to the proponents of civilized behavior. It is an act of disinhibition: Like a narcotic, it offers a sensation of glorious release from jailers no one else can see.'b'In the recollection of events, rudeness often has a role to play in the moral construction of a drama: It is the outward sign of an inward or unseen calamity. Rudeness itself is not the calamity. It is the harbinger, not the manifestation, of evil. In the Bible, Satan is not rude \xe2\x80\x94 he is usually rather charming \xe2\x80\x94 but the people who act in his service are. Jesus, on the other hand, often comes across as somewhat terse. Indeed, many of the people he encounters find him direct to the point of rudeness. The test, it is clear, is to tell rudeness from truth, and in the Bible that test is often failed. An unambiguous event \xe2\x80\x94 violence \xe2\x80\x94 is therefore required. The episode of the crucifixion is an orgy of rudeness whose villains are impossible to miss. The uncouth conduct of the Roman soldiers at the foot of the cross, for instance, can be seen in no other light: Anyone thinking that Jesus could have done a bit more to avoid his fate is offered this lasting example of humanity\xe2\x80\x99s incurable awfulness. They know not what they do, was Jesus\xe2\x80\x99 comment on his tormentors. Forgive them.'b''b'In the United Kingdom, 'b'the arguments rage over the rights and wrongs of the Brexit referendum result. I begin to think this is what it must be like to be the child of divorcing parents. Before, there was one truth, one story, one reality; now there are two. Each side accuses the other, and amid the raised voices, the unappeasable points of view, the vitriol and distress, the obfuscation and exaggeration and blame, the only thing that is demonstrably clear is that one side is ruder than the other. It seems to me that even if you didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what they were arguing about, you would have to come to that conclusion.'b'In the aftermath of their victory, the winners are markedly unmagnanimous. They brand those who voted the other way as a liberal elite, patronizing, self-interested, out of touch with real life. The liberal elite are characterized as bad losers, as though the vote were a football match. When they protest against or complain about the result and its consequences, they are immediately belittled and shouted down. In the weeks before the vote, the eventual victors\xe2\x80\x99 own handling of language resembled a small child\xe2\x80\x99s handling of an explosive device: They appeared to have no idea of its dangers or power. They used phrases like \xe2\x80\x9cWe want our country back\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cTake back control\xe2\x80\x9d that were open to any and every interpretation. Now they complain that they have been misrepresented as racist, xenophobic, ignorant. They are keen to end the argument, to quit the field of language where only the headachy prospect of detailed analysis remains, to take their dubious verbal victory and run for the hills. They have a blunt phrase they use in the hope of its being the last word, and it is characteristically rude: \xe2\x80\x9cYou lost. Get over it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The liberal elite, meanwhile, have evolved a theory: It is their belief that many of the people who voted to leave the European Union now regret their decision. There is no more tenuous comfort than that which rests on the possibility of another\xe2\x80\x99s remorse. In psychoanalysis, events are reconstructed in the knowledge of their outcome: The therapeutic properties of narrative lie in its capacity to ascribe meaning to sufferings that at the time seemed to have no purpose. The liberal elite are in shock; they fall upon the notion of the victors\xe2\x80\x99 regret as a palliative for their mental distress, but because the referendum result is irreversible, this narrative must adopt the form of tragedy.'b'Unlike the victors, the losers are loquacious. They render the logic of their suffering with exactitude and skill, waxing to new expressive heights. The deluge of fine writing that follows the referendum contrasts strangely with the reticence that preceded it. The liberal elite are defending their reality, but too late. Some urge a show of tolerance and understanding; others talk about the various stages of grief; others still call for courage in standing up for the values of liberalism. These are fine performances, but it is unclear whom they are for. I have often noticed how people begin to narrate out loud when in the presence of mute creatures, a dog, say, or a baby: Who is the silent witness to this verbal outpouring?'b'Meanwhile, in the Essex town of Harlow, a Polish man is murdered in the street by a gang of white youths who apparently heard him speaking his native language.'b''b'How can we ascertain'b' the moral status of rudeness? Children are the members of our society most often accused of being rude; they are also the most innocent. We teach children that it is rude to be honest, to say, \xe2\x80\x9cThis tastes disgusting\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cThat lady is fat.\xe2\x80\x9d We also teach them that it is rude to disrespect our authority. We give them orders: We say, \xe2\x80\x9cSit still\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cGo to your room.\xe2\x80\x9d At a certain point, I got into the habit, when addressing my children, of asking myself whether I would speak in the same way to an adult and discovered that in nearly every case the answer was no. At that time, I understood rudeness to be essentially a matter of verbal transgression: It could be defined within the morality of language, without needing to prove itself in a concrete act. A concrete act makes language irrelevant. Once words have been superseded by actions, the time for talking has passed. Rudeness, then, needs to serve as a barrier to action. It is what separates thought from deed; it is the moment when wrongdoing can be identified, in time to stop the wrong from having to occur. Does it follow, then, that a bigoted remark \xe2\x80\x94 however ugly to hear \xe2\x80\x94 is an important public interface between idea and action? Is rudeness a fundamental aspect of civilization\xe2\x80\x99s immunity, a kind of antibody that is mobilized by the contagious presence of evil?'b'In the United States, Hillary Clinton calls half the supporters of Donald Trump \xe2\x80\x9ca basket of deplorables.\xe2\x80\x9d At first the remark impressed me. I approved of Clinton for her courage and honesty, while reflecting on her curious choice of words. \xe2\x80\x9cBasket of deplorables\xe2\x80\x9d almost sounded like a phrase from Dr. Seuss: It would be typical of him to put deplorables in a basket, for the moral amusement of his young readers. A sack or a box of deplorables wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be the same thing at all, and a swamp of deplorables is too Dante-esque; but a basket is just the kind of zany, cheerful container that makes light of the deplorables while still putting them in their place. It quickly became clear, however, that as a public utterance, the phrase was malfunctioning. The basket began to speak, to distinguish itself: Inside it were a number of offended individuals. Clinton had made the mistake of being rude. The \xe2\x80\x9cbasket of deplorables\xe2\x80\x9d wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Dr. Seuss after all. It was the snobbish language of the liberal elite, caught committing the elemental moral crime of negating individual human value. Yet Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s adversary regularly committed this crime with impunity. Were Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s and Trump\xe2\x80\x99s two different kinds of rudeness?'b'In Britain, a man tweets that someone should \xe2\x80\x9cJo Cox\xe2\x80\x9d Anna Soubry. The amorality of the English tongue: In the run-up to the referendum, Jo Cox, a member of Parliament, was shot and stabbed to death by a far-right nationalist; to \xe2\x80\x9cJo Cox\xe2\x80\x9d someone is to murder a female member of Parliament who advocates remaining in the European Union. The man who posts the tweet is arrested. The police, it seems, are trying to get on top of our verbal problems. It has now become commonplace for proponents of liberal values to receive death threats. The death threat, I suppose, is the extreme of rudeness: It is the place where word finally has to be taken as deed, where civilization\xe2\x80\x99s immunity reaches the point of breakdown. \xe2\x80\x9cI could kill you,\xe2\x80\x9d my mother often used to say to me, and I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know whether to believe her or not. It is true that I frequently fell foul of her and others through my habit of outspokenness. The sharpness of my phrases maddened her. I was quite capable of the basket-of-deplorables mistake, the confusion of cleverness with insult, the belief in language as an ultimate good, the serving of which was its own reward. No one could mind what you said if you said it with sufficient skill, could they? Later I came to believe that the good of language lay entirely in its relationship to truth. Language was a system through which right and wrong \xe2\x80\x94 truth and untruth \xe2\x80\x94 could be infallibly identified. Honesty, so long as it was absolute, was a means for individuals to understand all good and evil.'b'The liberal elite, as far as I am aware, do not make death threats. Is this because they have better manners? Do they in fact wish that their enemies were dead but would just never say so? And if they do wish it \xe2\x80\x94 albeit politely, in the manner of a white lie \xe2\x80\x94 is the sin somehow less cardinal for being courteous? The anti-liberals do not seem to find their own penchant for death threats problematic. In America, Trump even makes a veiled one against Clinton. We are told by the newspapers that Trump invited the Clintons to his wedding, that their daughters are good friends. Is this verbal violence, then, simply incompetence? Is it the verbal equivalent of someone who has not learned the piano sitting down and trying to play Rachmaninoff\xe2\x80\x99s Third?'b'The rudeness of these public figures gives pleasure and relief, it is clear, to their audiences. Perhaps what they experience is not the possibility of actual violence but a sort of intellectual unbuttoning, a freedom from the constraint of language. Perhaps they have lived lives in which they have been continually outplayed in the field of articulation, but of this new skill \xe2\x80\x94 rudeness \xe2\x80\x94 they find that they are the masters. My mother\xe2\x80\x99s death threats undoubtedly arose from her frustration with my own use of language. What I did not take into account when I spoke to her was the difference in our social positions. She was a housewife with little education and a rapidly retreating beauty, for whom life was a process of discovering that no greatness had been held in store for her. She did such things for me as cook and clean, while I was on my way to university and liberty. Yet to my mind, she had an extraordinary power, the power to blacken my mental outlook and ruin my prospect of life. When I spoke to her, I thought I was addressing a tyrant in whose overthrow my only weapons were words. But words were the very things that roused her to violence, because at her life\xe2\x80\x99s core, she had been separated from them. Her labor, her maternal identity, her status were all outside the language economy. Instead, she formulated a story of herself whose simplifications and lies infuriated me. I aimed to correct her with truth \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps I thought that if only I could insult her with sufficient accuracy, we would be reconciled \xe2\x80\x94 but she refused to be corrected, to be chastened. In the end, she won by being prepared to sacrifice the moral basis of language. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t care what she said, or rather, she exacted from words the licentious pleasures of misuse; in so doing, she took my weapon and broke it before my eyes. She made fun of me for the words I used, and I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t respond by threatening her with death. I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t say \xe2\x80\x9cI could kill you\xe2\x80\x9d because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t true, and in language I had staked everything on telling the truth.'b''b'If inequality is the basis 'b'on which language breaks down, how is it best to speak?'b'In a clothes shop in London, I sift through the rails, looking for something to wear. The instant I came in, the assistant bounded up to me and recited what was obviously a set of phrases scripted by the management. I dislike being spoken to in this way, though I realize the assistant doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do so out of choice. I told her I was fine. I told her I would find her if I needed anything. But a few minutes later, she\xe2\x80\x99s back.'b'How\xe2\x80\x99s your day been so far? she says.'b'The truth? It\xe2\x80\x99s been a day of anxiety and self-criticism, of worry about children and money, and now to top it all off, I\xe2\x80\x99ve made the mistake of coming here in the unfounded belief that it will make me look nicer, and that making myself look nicer will help.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s been fine, I say.'b'There\xe2\x80\x99s a pause in which perhaps she is waiting for me to ask her about her own day in return, which I don\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Are you looking for something special? she says.'b'Not really, I say.'b'So you\xe2\x80\x99re just browsing, she says.'b'There is a pause.'b'Did I tell you, she says, that we have other sizes downstairs?'b'You did, I say.'b'If you want something in another size, she says, you just have to ask me.'b'I will, I say.'b'I turn back to the rails and find that if anything, my delusion has been strengthened by this exchange, which has made me feel ugly and unlikable and in more need than ever of transformation. I take out a dress. It is blue. I look at it on its hanger.'b'Good choice, the assistant says. I love that dress. The color\xe2\x80\x99s amazing.'b'Immediately I put it back on the rail. I move away a little. After a while, I begin to forget about the assistant. I think about clothes, their strange promise, the way their problems so resemble the problems of love. I take out another dress, this one wine-colored and dramatic.'b'God, that would look amazing, the assistant says. Is it the right size?'b'According to the label, it is.'b'Yes, I say.'b'Shall I put it in the fitting room for you? she says. It\xe2\x80\x99s just easier, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it? Then you\xe2\x80\x99ve got your hands free while you keep browsing.'b'For the first time, I look at her. She has a broad face and a wide mouth with which she smiles continually, desperately. I wonder whether the width of her smile was a factor in her being given this job. She is older than I expected. Her face is lined, and despite her efforts, the mouth betrays some knowledge of sorrow.'b'Thank you very much, I say.'b'I give her the dress, and she goes away. I find that I no longer want to be in the shop. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to try on the dress. I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to take my clothes off or look at myself in a mirror. I consider quietly leaving while the assistant is gone, but the fact that I have caused the dress to be put in the fitting room is too significant. Perhaps it will be transformative after all. On my way there, I meet the assistant, who is on her way out. She widens her eyes and raises her hands in mock dismay.'b'I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t expecting you to be so quick! she exclaims. Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you find anything else you liked?'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m in a bit of a hurry, I say.'b'God, I know exactly what you mean, she says. We\xe2\x80\x99re all in such a hurry. There just isn\xe2\x80\x99t time to stop, is there?'b'The fitting rooms are empty: There aren\xe2\x80\x99t any other customers. The assistant hovers behind me while I go into the cubicle where she has hung the dress. I wonder whether she will actually follow me in. I pull the curtain behind me and feel a sense of relief. My reflection in the mirror is glaring and strange. I have stood in such boxlike spaces before, alone with myself, and these moments seem connected to one another in a way I can\xe2\x80\x99t quite specify. It is as though life is a board game, and here is the starting point to which I keep finding myself unexpectedly returned. I take off my clothes. This suddenly seems like an extraordinary thing to do in an unfamiliar room in a street in central London. Through the gap in the curtain I can see into a dingy back room whose door has been left open. There are pipes running up the walls, a small fridge, a kettle, a box of tea bags. Someone has hung a coat on a hook. I realize that the theater of this shop is about to break down, and that the assistant\xe2\x80\x99s manner \xe2\x80\x94 her bad acting, her inability to disguise herself in her role \xe2\x80\x94 is partly to blame.'b'How is everything? she says.'b'I am standing there in my underwear, and her voice is so loud and close that I nearly jump out of my skin.'b'How\xe2\x80\x99s it going in there? How are you getting on?'b'I realize that she must be speaking to me.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99m fine, I say.'b'How\xe2\x80\x99s the fit? she says. Do you need any other sizes?'b'I can hear the rustle of her clothes and the scraping sound of her nylon tights. She is standing right outside the curtain.'b'No, I say. Really, I\xe2\x80\x99m fine.'b'Why don\xe2\x80\x99t you come out? she says. I can give you a second opinion.'b'Suddenly I am angry. I forget to feel sorry for her; I forget that she did not choose to say these things; I forget that she is perhaps in the wrong job. I feel trapped, humiliated, misunderstood. I feel that people always have a choice where language is concerned, that the moral and relational basis of our existence depends on that principle. I wish to tell her that there are those who have sacrificed themselves to defend it. If we stop speaking to one another as individuals, I want to say to her, if we allow language to become a tool of coercion, then we are lost.'b'No, I say. Actually, I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to come out.'b'There is a silence outside the curtain. Then I hear the rustling of her clothes as she starts to move away.'b'All right then, she says, in a voice that for the first time I can identify as hers. It is a flat voice, disaffected, a voice that expresses no surprise when things turn out badly.'b'I put my clothes back on and take the dress on its hanger and leave the cubicle. The assistant is standing with her back to me on the empty shop floor, her arms folded across her chest, looking out the window. She does not ask me how I got on or whether I liked the dress and intend to buy it. She does not offer to take the dress from me and hang it back on its rail. She is offended, and she is very deliberately showing it. We are, then, equal at least in our lack of self-control. I hang up the dress myself.'b'It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t my day, I say to her, by way of an apology.'b'She gives a small start and utters a sound. She is trying to say something: She is searching, I see, for one of her scripted phrases in the effort to reassume her persona. Falteringly, she half-smiles, but her mouth is turned down at the corners like a clown\xe2\x80\x99s. I imagine her going home this evening, unhappy.'b'When I tell the story afterward, making myself both its villain and its butt, it goes like this: I, currently dismayed by the sudden ascent of rudeness in our world and wondering what it means, am betrayed into rudeness myself by a personal sensitivity to language that causes me to do the very thing I despise, which is fail to recognize another human\xe2\x80\x99s individuality. But the person I tell it to doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hear it that way at all. He hears it as a story about how annoying shop assistants are.'b'I hate it when they do that, he says. It was good you made an issue of it. Maybe she\xe2\x80\x99ll give feedback to the management, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll stop making people say all that stuff.'b''b'What Jesus did'b' was sacrifice himself, use his body to translate word to deed, to make evil visible. While being crucified, he remained for the most part polite. He gave others much to regret. Their regret sustained 2,000 years of Christianity. Is regret, then, the most powerful emotion after all?'b'My mother and I don\xe2\x80\x99t speak to each other anymore, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about her lately. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about facts, about how they get stronger and clearer, while points of view fade or change. The loss of the parent-child relationship is a fact. It is also a failure. It is regrettable. The last time my parents spoke to me, my father said something very rude. He said I was full of shit. He put the phone down straight away after he said it, and I have not heard from him again. For a long time afterward, I was profoundly disturbed by his words: For my father to speak to me of shit, and claim that I was full of it, seemed to remove my basis for existing. Yet he was half of me: It was, I realized, for that reason that he felt he could speak to me the way he did. I was his child; he forgot that I was as real as he. It could be said that one-half of our country has told the other it is full of shit, deliberately choosing those words because it knows that their object finds rudeness \xe2\x80\x94 the desecration of language \xe2\x80\x94 especially upsetting.'b'In Sophocles\xe2\x80\x99 play \xe2\x80\x9cPhiloctetes,\xe2\x80\x9d the man who suffers most is also the man with the most powerful weapon, an infallible bow that could be said to represent the concept of accuracy. The hardhearted Odysseus abandoned the wounded Philoctetes on an island, only to discover 10 years later that the Trojan War could not be won without Philoctetes\xe2\x80\x99 bow. He returns to the island determined to get the bow by any means. For his part, Philoctetes has spent 10 years in almost unendurable pain: It is decreed that he cannot be healed other than by the physician Asclepius at Troy, yet he would rather die than help Odysseus by returning with him. Time has done nothing to break down the impasse: Philoctetes still can\xe2\x80\x99t forgive Odysseus; Odysseus still can\xe2\x80\x99t grasp the moral sensitivity of Philoctetes. It is for the third actor, Neoptolemus, a boy of pure heart, to resolve the standoff and bring an end to war and pain. Odysseus urges Neoptolemus to befriend Philoctetes in order to steal the bow, claiming it is for the greater good. Philoctetes, meanwhile, tells Neoptolemus the story of his dreadful sufferings and elicits his empathy and pity. In his dilemma, Neoptolemus realizes two things: that wrong is never justified by being carried out under orders, and that the bow is meaningless without Philoctetes himself. The moral power of individuality and the poetic power of suffering are the two indispensable components of truth. For his part, Neoptolemus might be said to represent the concept of good manners. In this drama, the expressive man and the rude man need each other, but without the man of manners, they will never be reconciled.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cMake her stop!\xe2\x80\x9d'b' my daughters used to beg me when they were younger and one was doing something the other didn\xe2\x80\x99t like. In other words: Restore to me the primacy of my version; rid me of this challenge to the experience of being me. One might say that what they wanted was justice, impartiality \xe2\x80\x94 but impartiality, I usually discovered, was not easy to attain. There were always two sides to their stories, and I lacked the ability to turn them into one. I have prided myself on my willingness to object to injustices, to speak my mind when I thought I saw wrong being done. But perhaps all I was ever doing was trying to make it stop, trying to return the world to something I could bear to live in, without necessarily understanding it first.'b'It strikes me that good manners would be the thing to aim for in the current situation. I have made a resolution, which is to be more polite. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what good it will do: This might be a dangerous time for politeness. It might involve sacrifices. It might involve turning the other cheek. A friend of mine says this is the beginning of the end of the global order: He says that in a couple of decades\xe2\x80\x99 time, we\xe2\x80\x99ll be eating rats and tulip bulbs, as people have done before in times of social collapse. I consider the role that good manners might play in the sphere of rat-eating, and it seems to me an important one. As one who has never been tested, who has never endured famine or war or extremism or even discrimination, and who therefore perhaps does not know whether she is true or false, brave or a coward, selfless or self-serving, righteous or misled, it would be good to have something to navigate by.'b''b''b''b''b'Jasilyn Charger was 19 when she learned her best friend had killed herself. Charger was Lakota Sioux, and she had left the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota for Portland, Ore., just a few months earlier. But in the summer of 2015, she flew home for her friend\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. Then, two days later, while she was still in Eagle Butte \xe2\x80\x94 the largest town on the Cheyenne River Reservation with a population of 1,300 \xe2\x80\x94 another friend killed herself. Charger was shocked. \xe2\x80\x9cIt hurt all of us because these were people who we thought we knew but really we had no idea what they were going through,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really woke us up.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the weeks that followed, more teenagers on the reservation killed themselves with belts, knives and handfuls of Benadryl. Native American teenagers and young adults are 1.5 times as likely to kill themselves as the national average, with suicides often clustering in epidemics that hit and fade. Suicide is so common on the reservation that Lakota youth don\xe2\x80\x99t bother to say \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted suicide\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cattempted suicide.\xe2\x80\x9d They just say \xe2\x80\x9cattempted\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccompleted.\xe2\x80\x9d By the end of that summer, Jasilyn told me, 30 Cheyenne River kids attempted and eight completed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe said, \xe2\x80\x98They committed suicide for a reason,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d Charger told me. In Eagle Butte, reasons weren\xe2\x80\x99t hard to find. Their elders liked to talk about them as the future, but no one seemed to pay much attention to how their lives were hard, bordering on hopeless. Cheyenne River kids had families struggling with poverty and parents and relatives with serious drug-abuse problems. Often there was violence at home, to the point that many youths had nowhere safe to go at night. And amid all this, there was a hard-edged social pressure to drink or use drugs.'b'Charger had seen all of this. Her father died before she was born; her mother, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cpaid the bills and drank.\xe2\x80\x9d She and her twin sister, Jasilea, were incredibly close even if, by 13, they were also perfect foils: Jasilea, willowy and bookish, a good student; Jasilyn, chubby and wild, cutting school and running away on the weekends to do odd jobs \xe2\x80\x94 mowing lawns, babysitting, breaking horses, selling weed \xe2\x80\x94 that helped put food on the table. But her mother called her in as a runaway one too many times, and the South Dakota Division of Child Protection Services took both girls, sending them to group homes on opposite sides of the state.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt felt like something had been sawed off,\xe2\x80\x9d Charger said about her separation from Jasilea. She got so depressed she was moved to a psychiatric unit, where she often got into fights. She aged out of the system at 17, but when she returned to the ranch developments and trailer parks of Eagle Butte, she struggled with depression. She and Jasilea had gone \xe2\x80\x9cfrom knowing everything about each other to being strangers.\xe2\x80\x9d She fell into a monthslong cocaine binge, crashing in abandoned cars with other homeless kids. Her weight had dropped to 80 pounds by the time that her cousin, Joseph White Eyes, intervened. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would say, \xe2\x80\x98You\xe2\x80\x99re killing yourself, and we need you,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d Charger recalled. \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x98Don\xe2\x80\x99t get high, let\xe2\x80\x99s go to a sweat.\xe2\x80\x99 He got me off drugs and into our culture.\xe2\x80\x9d She eventually found a job in Rapid City on the production team of the local Fox News affiliate but quit, she said, after her boss made one too many \xe2\x80\x9ccowboys and Indians\xe2\x80\x9d jokes in response to Native Americans\xe2\x80\x99 being shot by the police. In early 2015 she moved to Portland, as far away as she could get. She hadn\xe2\x80\x99t intended to return.'b'But now she was home, amid a new plague of suicides, and she wanted to do whatever she could to help other teenagers on the reservation. Together with White Eyes and their friend, Trenton Casillas-Bakeberg, she formed a youth group. They raised money for basketball tournaments and for a youth trip to the Red Nation Film Festival in California, where the kids were able to see the ocean for the first time in their landlocked lives. They went to the tribal council, demanding and getting funds for a safe house for young people. Most of all they counseled young people, urging them to look out for one another and get involved. \xe2\x80\x9cYeah, it looks all pretty on Facebook,\xe2\x80\x9d Charger remembered saying, \xe2\x80\x9cbut really, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on in real life? You can be busy getting on Snapchat while someone\xe2\x80\x99s getting bullied.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the suicide wave crested and broke, the youth group, now called the One Mind Youth Movement, turned to something more political. They spent that fall as part of the local campaign against the Keystone XL pipeline, whose route would cut under the Cheyenne River just upstream from the reservation that bears its name. And after the Obama State Department denied the Keystone XL permission to cross the U.S.-Canadian border in November 2015, they moved their focus to the neighboring Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the company Energy Transfer Partners was trying to build the Dakota Access Pipeline. That pipeline would move half a million barrels of oil a day beneath the Missouri River, the main source of drinking water for the Standing Rock Sioux, which is one of the cousin bands to Cheyenne River, as well as for other downstream Sioux reservations. The youths came to believe that the Dakota pipeline was not only a threat to their drinking water but also a harbinger of the larger environmental crisis their generation was set to inherit.'b'Last April, Charger, White Eyes and a few One Mind teenagers and mentors helped establish a tiny \xe2\x80\x9cprayer camp\xe2\x80\x9d just off the Dakota Access route, on the north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. Over the next six months that camp grew into an improbable movement that united conservative farmers with the old radicals of the American Indian Movement; urban environmentalists with the traditional chiefs of hundreds of tribes. As Donald Trump pushes forward with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access, he will face a movement emboldened by a victory on Dec. 4, 2016, when the Department of the Army denied an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline and directed the Army Corps to consider an alternate route. It was a rare triumph for both the environmental and land rights movements, as well as for the American left in an otherwise dark moment. But little remarked upon at the time was the unlikely seed from which the movement had grown: an anti-suicide campaign among a tight-knit group of youths, most younger than 25, impelled by tragedy and guided by prophecy.'b''b'At the start,'b' the camp seemed like a quixotic undertaking. Lakota culture is effectively run by the old \xe2\x80\x94 traditionally young people are supposed to apologize before they even speak in front of elders \xe2\x80\x94 so for the youths to take it upon themselves to lead a movement was a radical act. In March, concerned citizens of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, frustrated with the lack of action from their tribal council, the body that functions as the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s official, U.S.-recognized government, put out a call for help to the other Sioux reservations. One Mind Youth made the two-hour drive north to propose setting up a prayer camp modeled on the ones raised against the Keystone XL. The tribal council agreed to set up the camp but offered little other support, pessimistic about the effort. The youths were undeterred. In early April, a handful, joined by a few former Keystone activists, moved into tepees in a protected ravine beside the Cannonball River, on the extreme north end of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.'b'Those days, the temperatures were in the 30s and there was still snow on the ground. The youths dubbed the camp Sacred Stone and lit the sacred fire. At first, they lived on little more than bologna sandwiches, potato chips and water. But then residents from the small reservation town of Cannon Ball, up the hill from Sacred Stone, began to bring donations: leftovers from dinner, cut-up wooden corrals for the campfires, a chain saw. Life in the prayer camp was supposed to be lived \xe2\x80\x9cin ceremony,\xe2\x80\x9d a sort of mindfulness or religious retreat in which all things are done with the intention of maintaining purity. Days began with a water ceremony; the sacred fire had to be regularly fed; meals began with prayer and a \xe2\x80\x9cspirit plate\xe2\x80\x9d served for the ancestors; alcohol and drugs were strictly forbidden.'b'It was, in other words, the sort of safe place that the youths had been insisting was necessary for them. They needed a haven, Charger explained, to \xe2\x80\x9cregroup, figure out what you\xe2\x80\x99re going to do and not worry about where you\xe2\x80\x99re gonna sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d The previous fall, they rented a hotel room in Eagle Butte as an informal crash house for Cheyenne River youth, where sometimes as many as 20 teenagers stayed, sleeping and showering, safe from bullying or the lure of alcohol or drugs. The prayer camp at Standing Rock provided something similar. Members of One Mind would drive home every week to resupply and pick up youths who wanted to experience the camp.'b'For Charger and other leaders, as important as the idea of the safe space was the idea that activism would teach children the skills to survive more immediate threats, like bullying and drug abuse. They hoped to pass on skills at the camp that they themselves had been taught by Keystone activists in their community. During the long campaign against the Keystone XL, groups like the Indigenous Environmental Network (I.E.N.) helped set up a \xe2\x80\x9cspirit camp\xe2\x80\x9d on the Cheyenne River Reservation, about 50 miles southwest of Eagle Butte, where activists prayed and taught the surrounding communities about civil disobedience. The I.E.N. paid for One Mind members to be trained as organizers \xe2\x80\x94 they sent Charger to Washington and White Eyes to network with aboriginal climate activists in Australia \xe2\x80\x94 and the teenagers and young adults were exposed to ideas and training that linked the pipeline fight to larger struggles in their society. Every direct-action training against the Keystone XL, for example, referenced the prophecy of the black snake, a figure out of Lakota myth that in recent times has been identified with pipelines. But it has a more general meaning: \xe2\x80\x9cIt symbolizes a darkness, a sickness, whose only intention is to sow dysfunction and loss of life in our communities,\xe2\x80\x9d said Dallas Goldtooth, an I.E.N. organizer who worked with Charger and other One Mind members. The message was clear: The struggle against the pipeline was part of the same struggle against alcoholism, suicide and abuse.'b'After weeks at the Standing Rock camp with minimal tribal support, the young people decided that they needed to carry out some sort of public action. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was important to make the adults see that if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to sit there and argue, we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna go wake up our brothers and sisters,\xe2\x80\x9d Charger said. Bobbi Jean Three Legs, a young mother and long-distance runner from Standing Rock who had become active in the camp, had a vision. Her daughter woke her one night to ask for water, and she suddenly saw a day when, thanks to water pollution, there would be no water to give. Soon after that, she and White Eyes proposed a 500-mile relay run from the Sacred Stone Camp to Omaha to deliver a letter to the Army Corps of Engineers, asking it to deny the Dakota Access Pipeline permission to cross the Missouri River. The I.E.N. began a social-media campaign announcing the run and organized a blitz of calls and letters from tribal members on various reservations.'b'Within days, far sooner than expected, an Army Corps representative from the Omaha district agreed to meet with members of the tribe. To some, this meant the youths could call off the run. But they insisted on going ahead. Not only did they still want support from the tribal council; they had also begun to believe that this run could bring together young people from all the Sioux reservations. The seven bands of the people commonly known as the Sioux had organized themselves in the Oceti Sakowin, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe Seven Council Fires,\xe2\x80\x9d a tribal republic that spread out over a vast area, including the Dakotas, Minnesota, Kansas and Nebraska, until federal campaigns forced its members onto the scattered, tiny reservations they occupy now. One Mind saw water as an issue that could unify all Oceti Sakowin youth. And their run had rich cultural resonance: Before Europeans brought horses, long-distance messenger runners held the scattered tribes of Oceti Sakowin together. Three Legs, White Eyes and Charger mapped a route to pass through as many reservations as possible. The run would use a traditional method in which a messenger ran a short distance, about a mile, and then rested while another runner took his or her place. It allowed people who were not very good runners, like Charger, to go on a long-distance run.'b'Three Legs insisted on bringing someone from each of the nine Oceti Sakowin bands, and the run quickly brought in people from reservations that hadn\xe2\x80\x99t been involved with the Standing Rock camp. Daniel Grassrope, now 25, came from the Lower Brule, a band whose reservation lay down the Missouri from Cheyenne River. Grassrope, the second-youngest boy of 13 children, grew up disgusted by the abuse and dysfunction around him, \xe2\x80\x9cracist,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9ctoward my own people.\xe2\x80\x9d As a child, he dreamed of being taken away from his family and adopted by whites, something he associated, vaguely, with having his own bedroom and a mother who came to his basketball games. He was getting wasted every night when he saw Three Legs\xe2\x80\x99s Facebook posting asking someone to represent the Lower Brule on the run.'b'The run immediately gave him what Standing Rock would later give many other youths: a sense of purpose he had been lacking. It also inspired something more radical, in a way, than antipipeline activism: the belief that a group of lost people from scattered nations could still find kinship. Grassrope wrote to Three Legs immediately. \xe2\x80\x9cI had been praying for something like this,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b''b'On April 24, 'b'the runners set off south from the Sacred Stone Camp. They ran along the Cannonball River to Highway 1806, then down toward Cheyenne River, their first stop. Grassrope ran next to Charger, who was carrying a heavy staff that represented their ancestors. When she got too tired, Grassrope carried it. In doing so, according to Lakota belief, they were literally carrying all those who had come before. They stayed in churches and community centers and women\xe2\x80\x99s lodges and private homes. At every reservation, they met not only with tribal leaders but also with reservation youths, whom they talked to just as they had in Cheyenne River, telling them about the old ways and the camp upriver where those ways were being revived. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really caught them off guard,\xe2\x80\x9d Charger said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat they saw youth like them doing it.\xe2\x80\x9d Because the Native American community has become heavily networked on social media as a modern means to keep the bands united, word spread far beyond the communities they visited. When the youths arrived in Omaha on May 3, a representative of the Army Corps of Engineers met with them on the steps of the office. They still felt motivated as they went back to Standing Rock. Grassrope quit his job in Lower Brule and settled into the camp with them.'b'By then time seemed to be running out: The Army Corps of Engineers was still considering the Dakota Access Pipeline\xe2\x80\x99s permit, and the Tribal Council still wasn\xe2\x80\x99t offering much support. On July 9, through a video released on YouTube, Bobbi Jean Three Legs and several other runners announced an even more ambitious action: a run that would cover 2,000 miles to Washington, where they would deliver a petition to the Army Corps\xe2\x80\x99 headquarters. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need your help,\xe2\x80\x9d a young woman says in the video. Another woman, with glasses and a long black braid, says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to be traveling through many of your towns.\xe2\x80\x9d On July 15, 30 runners set out from Sacred Stone, adding more as they made their way along their route. Jasilyn Charger\xe2\x80\x99s estranged twin sister, Jasilea, was one. She was in bed asleep when Jasilyn, passing through Cheyenne River, ran into their house, threw her clothes into a bag and urged her onto their support van. Over the course of the next week or so, a dozen more joined.'b'But on July 26, the runners learned the Army Corps of Engineers had approved the Dakota Access pipeline easements. The black snake was on its way. The runners decided to carry on to Washington, but the focus shifted back to the camp, as I.E.N. activists at Standing Rock urged people via Facebook messages to rise to the standard set by the youths. Across the great archipelago of North America\xe2\x80\x99s Indian reservations and urban communities, people took notice. They loaded cars and buses and camper vans with donations and headed for Standing Rock.'b'Twenty-six-year-old Eryn Wise moved to the camp in late August, at the beginning of what organizers called the big boom, when the population spiked from dozens to thousands. A native of Minneapolis, Wise was raised by her grandmother on the Jicarilla Apache Reservation after a suicide attempt at 11. On the reservation, she was picked on for excelling at school but was surrounded by her siblings, with whom she formed a close bond. But she returned to Minneapolis when she was 16 to care for her mother. When she read an article about the youth run she felt a pull and quit her job. She found her twin siblings, Alex and Lauren Howland, already at the camp.'b'Wise arrived just as the elders began to claim more control over the movement the youths had started. The run, Goldtooth told me, had forced their support by transforming the Dakota Access pipeline from a regional Lakota issue into an international one. Standing Rock council members began to visit the camps and pay for emergency services, propane and portable toilets. The camp had expanded onto the floodplain across the river, and grass-roots activists and members of the unelected traditional leadership, which serves as a sort of parallel Oceti Sakowin government, erected a Council Lodge, a large tepee from the tribe\xe2\x80\x99s past that the young people had only heard about. The Council Lodge was the traditional meeting place of the Oceti Sakowin in the 19th century, when the bands would gather on the Plains. The Council Lodge tepee at Standing Rock was a sign of a new political awakening, as the traditional chiefs and medicine men collaborated with grass-roots organizers \xe2\x80\x94 the youth and other Native American factions that had joined \xe2\x80\x94 to restore the old, unified tribal republic. It was part of a larger move toward formalizing the prayer camps under a council government. By then, the protests against the pipeline had, for the traditional leadership, become about far more: They had become a long-prophesied end to history.'b'The black-snake, prophesy said, would only be overcome by the Seventh Generation, which would rise up and, as Charger explained, \xe2\x80\x9cbring balance to the Earth. Not just to its people. To the Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d Many of the youths that I spoke with took this to mean the Seventh Generation had a sort of messianic role to help restore order, on behalf of all beings, to a world thrown out of balance by modernity and greed.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Seventh Generation is almost clich\xc3\xa9 in Indian communities,\xe2\x80\x9d Goldtooth, the I.E.N. organizer told me. Anyone born between 1980 and the 2000s, he said, \xe2\x80\x9chears about it constantly. The hope that our generation will see a significant shift toward community renewal and nation building and the reminder that our communities expect big things of us.\xe2\x80\x9d The Seventh Generation tracks roughly with millennials of all races, but they share their own unique history. The generation between Goldtooth, 34, and Charger, now 20, is the first to have grown up free to be Indian. They are familiar with their ancestors\xe2\x80\x99 scars but also fluent in mainstream American culture.'b'At Standing Rock, the elders, once resistant to their movement, now insisted that the youths accept the responsibility that the prophecy had foretold. In early September, the Seven Council Fires and Chief Arvol Looking Horse, who, for the Lakota Sioux, is something like their head of religion, gave the youths a gift: a 'b'chanupa'b', the ceremonial pipe that is the most sacred element of the Plains religion, a symbol of the knitting together of the human community and nature, ancestors with the living. In a ceremony under the blazing sun, the council deputized the youths as 'b'akicita'b', a Lakota term that means something like \xe2\x80\x9cwarriors for the people\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpolice.\xe2\x80\x9d It is difficult to overstate the importance of this gesture. The youths, Looking Horse explained to me, \xe2\x80\x9cweren\xe2\x80\x99t really ready for it, but we told them that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to accept it and learn the traditions. We said they had to be of pure mind. They said, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll try.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'After the ceremony,'b' the youths, who had begun to call themselves the International Indigenous Youth Council, or I.I.Y.C., to symbolize their desire to unite all nations behind a traditional way of life, moved together into a tepee by the Cannonball River. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of our first month or two living together,\xe2\x80\x9d Wise said, \xe2\x80\x9cwas just having someone break down crying.\xe2\x80\x9d In her short time at the camp, Wise had become a sort of surrogate mother to the other young people \xe2\x80\x94 her nickname even became Ina, or \xe2\x80\x9cmother\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and she found herself in charge of a group of about 25 who were barely holding it together, despite the leadership they had assumed. The I.I.Y.C. was the first experience of family for many members. \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of them never had the opportunity to be kids, because they were always trying to take care of themselves or take care of their parents.\xe2\x80\x9d This process, one of the youth leaders told me, was \xe2\x80\x9cterribly beautiful,\xe2\x80\x9d an unburdening of the \xe2\x80\x9chistorical trauma\xe2\x80\x9d that had defined their lives. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one realizes what the repercussions of colonization have been, the repercussions of forced removal,\xe2\x80\x9d Wise said. It was hard, she stressed, to explain to people that these were things that had happened recently, to her generation\xe2\x80\x99s parents and grandparents.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t blame my mom,\xe2\x80\x9d Charger told me. \xe2\x80\x9cHer mother was murdered.\xe2\x80\x9d She shrugged. \xe2\x80\x9cThe abuse lives in our blood.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Charger was referring to Native American history, not just what happened on the frontier but also in more recent decades. After federal campaigns reduced the Oceti Sakowin in the late 1800s, there were nearly 100 years of calculated assault as the state tried to force Native Americans to assimilate. The unified nation of Oceti Sakowin was broken into widely separated reservations, and after Congress privatized reservation land, many starving Lakota families had to sell off their property to white farmers, further cutting the size of reservations. The U.S. Government banned the Sundance, the Plains religions\xe2\x80\x99 most sacred ceremony, with its days of fasting and ritual bloodletting; Native Americans could no longer openly practice their religions. But perhaps most devastating to their psychological health were the boarding schools, in which generations of Indians were sent to schools to be taught white culture. This system reached its nadir in the forced assimilation campaigns of the 1940s and 1950s, when the grandparents of many of the I.I.Y.C. youths were taught English literally under the lash.'b'At Standing Rock, the youths felt they were developing the means to overcome that trauma. The key, as Charger explained it, was to let their history go, which they took as an almost holy responsibility: Forgive, and then take action to spare those who are coming in the future. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want our children to inherit this depression,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. The remarkable thing about this philosophy was that it was deeply practical: not just forgiving \xe2\x80\x9cthe white man\xe2\x80\x9d but also the parent who beat you. For many, this provided a means to re-establish difficult relationships with parents or siblings. But it also helped bind them together into their own sort of family.'b'In the final months of 2016, the camps at Standing Rock grew to more than 10,000, filling with indigenous peoples from hundreds of nations, climate-change activists, members of the Rainbow Family and Burning Man communities and those who simply felt a call. By that point, the role of the I.I.Y.C. had become a sort of advance guard, taking risks and pushing actions forward and winning new young converts to the cause.'b'Thomas Tonatiuh Lopez Jr. was one. A 24-year-old Lakota and Latino from Denver, Lopez grew up the child of AIM and Chicano activists, and as the adopted grandson of the powerful medicine man Leonard Crowdog. He came to Standing Rock in September on a supply run and hadn\xe2\x80\x99t intended to stay. Once he found himself at the camp, Lopez was touched by the message of activism and reconciliation. One afternoon, he was sitting with I.I.Y.C. members, rolling cigarettes for everyone in front of a fire, as Charger talked about the role of youth. \xe2\x80\x9cShe said one thing that stuck with me: Who better to speak for the past than the voice of the future?\xe2\x80\x9d He thought about it as he drove home to Denver, and when he got there, he helped establish a local I.I.Y.C. chapter, drawing from local indigenous and Latino youths. In mid-November, the group took hundreds of Denver high-school students for a march through downtown to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline. Another new chapter, in Chicago, galvanized hundreds for Thanksgiving events that drew in members of other activist groups, including Black Lives Matter, which resulted in black community medics going to serve in Standing Rock\xe2\x80\x99s volunteer medical corps.'b'One factor that helped recruitment into the regional chapters and Standing Rock was the increasing violence by the police at the camps. The images of campers being maced or attacked by dogs spread anger across the country, and many brought that anger to Standing Rock. For traditional leadership, any violence was deeply concerning. Part of the matrix of prophecy that underlies their movement is the idea that should the Oceti Sakowin or their allies resort to violence, they could be wiped out. Among the Native Americans there were strict rules that the protest would have to be done in \xe2\x80\x9cpeace and prayer.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The youths took this seriously, even as they found themselves under physical threat. Wise, the camp mom, remembers, for instance, watching on Facebook Live as her sister was maced. Furious, she raced to the scene and threw herself at the police. Suddenly there were six hands on her shoulders: I.I.Y.C. members, pulling her back. She saw her brother Alex, his face white with what appeared to be war paint. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was pointing over my shoulder and shouting, \xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99ll pray for you, we\xe2\x80\x99ll pray for you!\xe2\x80\x9d His face, she realized, was covered in tear gas, \xe2\x80\x9cand he was still praying for them. That brought me back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The youths also tried to reach out to the Morton County Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department, which in the larger camp had come to be seen as the enemy. After the Army Corps of Engineers withdrew permission for the camp in late November, protesters expected the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s department to violently clear campers off the land. But on Dec. 2, when the department posted on Facebook soliciting donations of granola bars, fruit soda and socks, the I.I.Y.C. showed up with large plastic containers filled with granola bars, warm clothing and water. Lopez, who had returned to the camp to stay in October, made a speech: \xe2\x80\x9cThough you have brutalized us, we will not brutalize you.\xe2\x80\x9d The station was on lockdown; after a while, an officer looking sheepish in his helmet, faceplate and full body armor, opened the door and accepted the containers. From the crowd, someone yelled for Lopez to explain to the officer why they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t brought soda. Lopez half turned. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want you to be healthy!\xe2\x80\x9d he yelled. \xe2\x80\x9cMni wichoni! Water is life!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was a small gesture, but one that prompted thanks from the officers and anger from some in the camps. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you supporting them?\xe2\x80\x9d Wise remembers people asking. But prophecy was important to the youths; they worried that if the movement became too violent, it would ruin everything they had been trying to build.'b''b'On Dec. 4, 'b'2016, as thousands of military veterans from across the country crowded the camp in solidarity, the Department of the Army announced its decision to deny an easement for the Dakota Access Pipeline route. The decision was a shock and an unexpected triumph. That night, as a blizzard descended on the camp, David Archambault II, the chairman of the Standing Rock reservation\xe2\x80\x99s official tribal government, presided over a ceremony around the main fire to thank the youths. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen the youth ran to D.C., that\xe2\x80\x99s when this really got started,\xe2\x80\x9d Archambault told the crowd, as people lined up to shake the hands of the gathered runners. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all came here to stand for something greater than whatever we did at home.\xe2\x80\x9d Now, with winter bearing down, he said, everyone could begin to go home.'b'But the youths didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to go home. For them, leaving was more complicated. They thought that the \xe2\x80\x9cvictory\xe2\x80\x9d was too tentative. Energy Transfer Partners had announced it would ignore the Army\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and the election of Donald J. Trump had put into office a president who vocally supported both the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines. \xe2\x80\x9cDave Archambault doesn\xe2\x80\x99t speak for our entire generation,\xe2\x80\x9d Jasilyn Charger said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he dies, my grandchildren are going to be here, and nobody can speak for them but me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was also a more personal problem. Many of them had nowhere else to go. They had become dependent on the I.I.Y.C. for a support network and a place to live. Over their months spent in close quarters, the members of the youth council had bound themselves together not only as friends but as family. The stakes of dissolving the group had become obvious in a more immediate way, too: One of the youth runners had already attempted suicide and been rushed to the hospital in Bismarck. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not safe for them to stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d Wise told me in mid-December, as temperatures remained below zero and the ground was covered with ice. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I also don\xe2\x80\x99t want that to happen to any of these kids.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As the camps emptied out, though, there were not enough resources for everyone to stay, and most of the young people dispersed for the winter, leaving behind a skeleton crew of 10. Wise went home to Minneapolis to begin a job as an organizer for Honor the Earth, an indigenous environmental activist group. Grassrope went back to Lower Brule. Charger was couch-surfing with friends in Eagle Butte. Tribal leaders of the Cheyenne River had found a property for the youth safe house that One Mind had fought for, but progress had stalled, and life for the reservation\xe2\x80\x99s youths was as hard as it had been before. But the I.I.Y.C. were in the process of setting up a 501(c)(3), a nonprofit organization that would allow them to establish some formal order to what had been an ad hoc group.'b'And in January, after a month apart, the I.I.Y.C. youths reunited in Washington for the mass protests against Donald Trump. They were still in Washington when the news came that he had signed executive orders allowing the Dakota Access and Keystone pipelines to proceed. After that, Jasilyn Charger made the trip back to Standing Rock. She planned to spend a couple of days there before heading south to Eagle Butte, where she would organize against the Keystone. \xe2\x80\x9cMy sole purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cis to create for the youth what we did in Standing Rock at my home in Cheyenne River. To really challenge the youth in my community to follow in the lead of Standing Rock to fight for their own people, because if they don\xe2\x80\x99t, this black snake will not die again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All believed their work had to spread, not because they necessarily believed they could stop the pipeline but because the movement had connected, as Lopez told me, \xe2\x80\x9cyouths who would otherwise never have had much interaction.\xe2\x80\x9d He offered a practical reason as well: In December, back home in Denver, he got a call from a young person on the verge of suicide. He felt helpless, but he stayed on the phone, \xe2\x80\x9clistening to hear, not listening to respond. All I could do was say: \xe2\x80\x98You are loved, someone cares about you, not necessarily right where you are, but in your community at Standing Rock. Even if you feel no one loves you, no one cares about you, I love you, I care about you. I want to pray with you again. And if you kill yourself now, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be able to do that.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He paused. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd my brother is still alive today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''b''b'N'b'o one would tell The Rev. Victor White how his son died. Everyone seemed to know \xe2\x80\x94 but no one would tell him.'b'When a detective from the Louisiana State Police spoke to him at sunrise on a Monday morning, she wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say much; she said his son was dead and his body transported to a hospital. White, in disbelief, did not give the full story to his wife, Vanessa, but he could tell she feared the worst. During the two-hour drive to New Iberia, where his son and his son\xe2\x80\x99s infant daughter lived, neither parent spoke.'b'At the Iberia Medical Center, nobody would answer White\xe2\x80\x99s questions. An administrator directed him to the admitting doctor, who directed him to the attending state trooper, who directed him to an investigator from the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s office, who directed him back to the trooper. White left Vanessa sobbing in the waiting room and at last was taken to the morgue. He was allowed to view the corpse only from the neck up, but that was enough; he could see that his son had been beaten. A bruise extended from his left eyebrow to his jaw. His lips and nose were swollen, and, White says, his left eye was bashed in. When White returned to the waiting room, his wife was gone. She had been taken away to be sedated.'b'The coroner\xe2\x80\x99s investigator approached White. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like he wanted to say something, without saying it,\xe2\x80\x9d White says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe said: \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m so sorry.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d White said the investigator mumbled this repeatedly for several minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t say anything,\xe2\x80\x9d the official said finally, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you should look into your son\xe2\x80\x99s death.\xe2\x80\x9d (A lawyer for the coroner\xe2\x80\x99s office, citing litigation, declined to respond to questions for this article.)'b'The Louisiana State Police never did tell White what happened to his son. He learned of their account through a news release posted online that evening, March 3, 2014. The police said that Victor White III, while detained in the back seat of a locked police car, his hands shackled behind his back, had committed suicide by shooting himself in the back with a handgun that an officer had not found during an earlier search.'b'New Iberia, a small city surrounded by sugar cane 100 miles west of New Orleans, is bisected by railroad tracks. North of the tracks, where residents are predominantly white, most believed that Victor White III committed suicide. In the largely black neighborhoods south of the tracks, most residents shared the Whites\xe2\x80\x99 conviction that their son was executed by the cops. In the months of heartbreak and rage that followed, New Iberians tended to believe the official account of the \xe2\x80\x9cHoudini suicide\xe2\x80\x9d to the extent that they approved of the performance of Louis Ackal, the sheriff of Iberia Parish.'b'Ackal \xe2\x80\x94 who declined multiple requests for comment for this article \xe2\x80\x94 was the most powerful man in town and perhaps the most popular. A fourth-generation New Iberian, he was a southern Louisiana politician in the old mold: charismatic and irascible, given to country bromides and plain-spoken provocations, antagonistic to the regional press and civil-liberties groups, chummy with the political class, a friend to many and a bully to the rest. He smoked cigars and kicked his boots onto his desk during meetings. He had come to office as a reformer, pledging to bring integrity to the police force and criminals to justice \xe2\x80\x94 to, as he put it in a campaign speech, clean up \xe2\x80\x9ca terrible mess.\xe2\x80\x9d To the satisfaction of a plurality of voters, he had succeeded.'b'At Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s request, the state police opened an investigation into the death. Additional investigations were later started by the F.B.I., the United States attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office for the Western District of Louisiana and the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s civil rights division. But the man best suited to investigate the strange death of Victor White III \xe2\x80\x94 the man with the most intimate knowledge of New Iberia, its legacy of racial conspiracy, the inner workings of the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office \xe2\x80\x94 was the victim\xe2\x80\x99s father. The Rev. Victor White was motivated by grief, anger and a desire for justice, but that was not all. He was also haunted by the fear that his own actions, his own history in New Iberia, might have led to his son\xe2\x80\x99s death.'b''b'Victor White III, 'b'whom everyone called Little Vic, was the sixth of nine children and the Whites\xe2\x80\x99 youngest son. (One of the older brothers, Victor White Jr., is known as Junior.) Little Vic inherited his father\xe2\x80\x99s tall, rangy stature; his large, expressive eyes; his exuberant manner. When the brothers got in trouble \xe2\x80\x94 when, for instance, they were caught playing in the attic with a sword their father brought back from Korea \xe2\x80\x94 Little Vic always took the blame, though he was a terrible liar. He did manage to convince his parents of one thing: After attending a Baptist service and witnessing all the jumping, shouting and singing, he begged his parents to change denominations. Not only did they agree, but Victor Sr., a mental-health and substance-abuse counselor, became ordained as a Baptist minister.'b'The Whites are not from New Iberia but the longleaf pine region of central Louisiana. They lived in Alexandria, a somewhat larger city with a somewhat broader perspective on questions of class and race. White can trace his family line back to a plantation outside the nearby town of Cheneyville. \xe2\x80\x9cMy grandmother,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, \xe2\x80\x9cwas a slave. She was born around 1900. She worked in the cotton field and worked domestic as well.\xe2\x80\x9d I took this to mean that she worked under slavelike conditions. White responded forcefully: \xe2\x80\x9cShe was a slave.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In late 2006, a pastor in New Iberia called White with a desperate request. The city, which had a long history of racial brutality, was in the throes of a new crisis. The source of the tension, as it had been so many times before, was the annual Louisiana Sugar Cane Festival. The festival was really two festivals: The official festival, held downtown, featured parades, a boat procession down the Bayou Teche and a 'b'fais do-do'b', presided over by the members of a royal court, many drawn from the ancien r\xc3\xa9gime families of prominent planters. The second festival was held across the tracks in the West End, on land that once belonged to the Hopkins sugar plantation. During the Jim Crow era, this second celebration was formalized as the Brown Sugar Festival, with its own parade and a Queen Brown Sugar. In recent years, it had been a looser affair, an occasion for block parties, D.J. sets and joy riding down Hopkins Street, past the shacks with rusted tin roofs, the overgrown lots, the bodegas advertising daiquiris and Wings cigarettes.'b'On the final day of that year\xe2\x80\x99s festival, after traffic on Hopkins Street came to a standstill, deputies of the New Iberia sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office fired grenades of tear gas into the black crowds. The sheriff, Sid Hebert, claimed his deputies gassed the revelers out of concern for their health. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was only a matter of minutes,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore someone in the crowd would fire a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d In a federal lawsuit, later dismissed, 160 West End residents claimed to have suffered injuries. The oldest claimants grew up under Jim Crow; the youngest was 8 months old.'b'Hebert expressed remorse about the incident and agreed to meet with local ministers to improve his department\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the West End. White, who had developed a reputation among Baptist ministers in southern Louisiana for engaging law enforcement on civil rights issues, was asked to serve as mediator. In early 2007, he moved his family to New Iberia. Little Vic was 15.'b'White helped to open a community center on Hopkins and ran a substance-abuse program that attracted clients from both sides of the tracks, including members of some of the most prominent white families. He began to understand the nature of power in New Iberia and the sinuous channels it pursued. He wanted to make sure his children understood too. He made a point of taking them to the Sugar Cane Festival. Almost immediately, they were stopped and questioned by the police. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took them for a loop,\xe2\x80\x9d White says. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d never seen stuff like that in Alexandria. They said: \xe2\x80\x98Daddy, what are they stopping us for?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The Whites rented a house just off Hopkins; there was a working sugar-cane field at the end of their block. They held barbecues and kept their doors open. They spoke about the need to establish a public-transportation system, to rebuild the local elementary school, to encourage children to develop professional ambitions. \xe2\x80\x9cIf we could get those kids,\xe2\x80\x9d White says, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could get their parents.\xe2\x80\x9d White felt he was making progress, particularly when it came to restoring faith in the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department. He had the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s cellphone number and called it often. He says he provided leads for criminal investigations and complained when cops behaved arrogantly. But Hebert\xe2\x80\x99s term was up in 2008, and a new sheriff came to town.'b''b'In downtown New'b' Iberia, where the millionaires lived, and in the less ostentatious, leafy City Park neighborhood, north of the Bayou Teche, Louis Ackal was welcomed home in 2008 as a savior. Most New Iberians grew up knowing his family, which arrived in south Louisiana in the late 1880s, during the first wave of Lebanese immigration to the United States. For 60 years, the Ackals owned a department store and a shoe store on Main Street. A local bridge that spans the Teche is named for Elias Ackal Jr., known as Bo, who served for more than two decades in the Louisiana House of Representatives. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were part of the old guard,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jarrod Alleman, an oil-field safety specialist who attended school with members of the Ackal family. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of our elected officials came out of a pool of people who were connected, and it had been like that forever. He was part of the ruling elite.\xe2\x80\x9d Yet Alleman, like many on the north side, saw Ackal as a reformer. \xe2\x80\x9cHe was worldly. He had been places, had done other things. He seemed like a professional, not just someone\xe2\x80\x99s brother-in-law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ackal passed for worldly in New Iberia because he left town three decades earlier to work as a state trooper, serving at one point in the governor\xe2\x80\x99s office, before retiring to a small mountain town in northwest Colorado. He came out of retirement, he said, because he was disturbed by the \xe2\x80\x9chorror stories\xe2\x80\x9d he had heard about residents\xe2\x80\x99 encounters with the police in his hometown. There was a sense in the community that crime rates were unusually high for a place the size of New Iberia. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not a big fan of politics,\xe2\x80\x9d Ackal said in a campaign speech. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason I ran was because people told me they were scared in their own homes.\xe2\x80\x9d Besides, he added, he missed the \xe2\x80\x9ccrawfish and crabs and gumbo, and Cajun music.\xe2\x80\x9d Ackal ran as a change candidate, pledging to strengthen the internal-affairs unit and repair the relationship between the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department and residents. He vowed to hire a public-information officer to communicate regularly with the press. He promised transparency, professionalism, strength.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of people had faith in him,\xe2\x80\x9d Julie Comeaux, a stay-at-home mother in the City Park neighborhood, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople looked to him to move us forward.\xe2\x80\x9d If anyone could move the community forward, it was the sheriff. Louisiana sheriffs have a staggering measure of power and few checks on it. They collect taxes, run the jails and command the police force. In the smaller cities and parishes, they often hold greater political clout than mayors, parish presidents and businessmen \xe2\x80\x94 a power that derives in no small part from their ability to pursue criminal investigations of mayors, parish presidents and businessmen. As Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish once put it, when asked why he declined to run for statewide office: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy would I want to be governor when I can be king?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It helped that Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s family was respected on both sides of town. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Ackals I knew were just wonderful people, personable, sweet,\xe2\x80\x9d says Phebe Hayes, a former professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and amateur historian of African-American life in the parish. \xe2\x80\x9cThey didn\xe2\x80\x99t feel very Old South. More Old World.\xe2\x80\x9d Two generations earlier, when black-owned restaurants, upholstery shops and pharmacies thrived in the West End and Count Basie and Ella Fitzgerald played in the nightclubs, before it fell into an eerie dilapidated vacancy, the Ackals ran a general store on Hopkins. Ackal boasted of the store while stumping for votes on the West End, White says, which made him suspicious.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe was intimidating, very arrogant,\xe2\x80\x9d White says. \xe2\x80\x9cHe walked into peoples\xe2\x80\x99 yards. He\xe2\x80\x99d say: \xe2\x80\x98My grandfather owned that store. When y\xe2\x80\x99all went in to go shopping, who you think it was? That was my people. We were helping y\xe2\x80\x99all. Y\xe2\x80\x99all owe me.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'White was appalled to find that this argument was persuasive among his neighbors. They told him that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand, because he was an outsider. \xe2\x80\x9cI said: \xe2\x80\x98I do understand. This is what I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get you out of. Y\xe2\x80\x99all are 40 years behind Alexandria.\xe2\x80\x99 But they thought he was going to help them. That was when I became the villain.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'White met Ackal for the first time at the community center, shortly after the election. It was a brief conversation. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going in a different direction,\xe2\x80\x9d White says Ackal told him. Ackal reassigned the West End community liaison, installed a police substation within the community center and fought to increase the size of the jail. White, refusing to concede defeat, remained in New Iberia, working as a substance-abuse counselor.'b'On the north side of town, many residents felt that Ackal was making good on his promises. He bought new uniforms and squad cars, to which he affixed bumper stickers reading, \xe2\x80\x9cIn God We Trust.\xe2\x80\x9d When the American Civil Liberties Union complained, Ackal defended the stickers by saying that his officers had accepted God into their lives. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is no God,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthen we don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good police officer, do we?\xe2\x80\x9d There were rumors of police brutality, though most people on the north side didn\xe2\x80\x99t know anyone who had suffered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe figured he was corrupt,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jarrod Alleman. \xe2\x80\x9cWe started hearing that things were going on. But they weren\xe2\x80\x99t happening where we were. When I got pulled over for speeding, the cop took a look at my license and said: \xe2\x80\x98You live on Oak? I grew up down the street.\xe2\x80\x99 If I were someone else, maybe of a different color, and lived in the West End, I\xe2\x80\x99m 100 percent positive it would have gone down differently.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It did go down differently in the West End, where the police came to be seen as an occupying army. The jail population surged, the cells becoming so overcrowded that inmates were forced to sleep on the floor. Following Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Sheriff Joe Arpaio, Ackal punished prisoners by dressing them in hot pink jumpsuits and making them sleep in a pink cell he called the Flamingo Hotel. He boasted about denying ice to inmates in hot weather. \xe2\x80\x9cA state inspector came in and said: \xe2\x80\x98Sheriff Ackal, you need to put ice chests, ice buckets and scoops in the cells,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d he told a crowd of supporters, to laughter. \xe2\x80\x9cI said: \xe2\x80\x98Lady, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know where you come from, but this is not the [Hotel] Monteleone. It\xe2\x80\x99s the Iberia Parish Jail.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d At the 2011 Sugar Cane Festival, Ackal sent his officers to the West End to break up the celebration. They blasted sirens to drown out the music and, once again, fired tear gas into the crowd.'b''b'White finally gave 'b'up and moved his family back to Alexandria. Little Vic and his brother Leonard were unhappy: Each had a girlfriend from Iberia Parish who didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to leave. In 2013, after the birth of his daughter, Arianna, and against his parents\xe2\x80\x99 desperate warnings, Little Vic returned.'b'White could not believe that his son committed suicide, because every aspect of Little Vic\xe2\x80\x99s life seemed oriented toward the future. Upon returning to New Iberia, he enrolled in a welding program at the local community college, planning to work on offshore rigs. He took a job at a Waffle House, often pulling double shifts. His final conversation with his father took place at 7 a.m. on the last morning of his life. Little Vic had just received a tax rebate and was eager to buy a used Chrysler from a man who fixed up broken-down cars. He had taken cash with him \xe2\x80\x94 $1,400 \xe2\x80\x94 but after a test drive, he suspected there was a problem with the transmission. White warned him to wait until the seller provided a warranty. \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., Dad,\xe2\x80\x9d said Little Vic. That was it.'b'Little Vic\xe2\x80\x99s only previous encounter with the police after returning to New Iberia occurred about five months before, in November, when he was stopped for making an illegal U-turn. He did as his father had told him: He announced that he was the son of the Rev. Victor White and demanded the cops call his father. The officers, unmoved, arrested him. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Little Vic knows he\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d says Vanessa, who speaks of her son in the present tense, \xe2\x80\x9che has a way of getting under your skin.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The officers who arrested him were named Justin Ortis and Jason Javier. The same men stopped Little Vic near the train tracks that split New Iberia at 11:31 p.m. on the night of March 2, 2014. Minutes earlier, Little Vic and an acquaintance named Isaiah Lewis were buying cigarillos at a nearby Texaco gas station when a fight broke out in the parking lot. Ortis, suspecting that White and Lewis were involved, patted them down. Nothing was found on Lewis, and he was released.'b'After that, in the police\xe2\x80\x99s version of events, officers found a small quantity of narcotics \xe2\x80\x94 marijuana and cocaine \xe2\x80\x94 in White\xe2\x80\x99s pocket, and he was detained. Because he asked to speak with narcotics detectives, the officers did not take him to the Iberia Parish Jail, where arrestees are booked, but to the patrol center downtown. When they arrived, according to police statements, White \xe2\x80\x9cbecame uncooperative and refused to exit the deputy\xe2\x80\x99s patrol vehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d He wanted them to promise that he would not be sent to jail. When a deputy said he could not make that promise, White said to \xe2\x80\x9ctell his people that he loved them.\xe2\x80\x9d He said: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to go to jail,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m gone.\xe2\x80\x9d Next, the deputies claim in the police report, they heard a gunshot.'b'The state police also later claimed that Leonard White volunteered to investigators that his brother was carrying a .25-caliber pistol that night that matched the description of the weapon found next to Little Vic\xe2\x80\x99s body in the back seat. (White\xe2\x80\x99s family denies this.)'b'Victor White, not trusting the police, immediately began his own investigation of the case. He uncovered a number of apparent inconsistencies in the official narrative. Among the most glaring was the assertion that Little Vic had shot himself in the back. Before making the autopsy results public, the parish coroner at the time, Carl Ditch, told White that the bullet entered his son\xe2\x80\x99s chest, White says, contradicting the original news release. Ditch noted that the bullet had entered the side of his chest, beneath the right nipple, and exited under his left armpit. But Little Vic was left-handed. White was incredulous: \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re trying to tell me that my son, while handcuffed, reached his left hand all the way around the front of his chest and shot himself from the right? I said: \xe2\x80\x98No, sir.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There were inauspicious coincidences. The incident took place in a part of the patrol-center parking lot that had no surveillance cameras. The back-seat camera in the cruiser in which White died was turned off, as was the microphone. When White picked up his son\xe2\x80\x99s possessions, Little Vic\xe2\x80\x99s wallet contained only $91. But White believed that his son was carrying about $1,400. When White told the officer that there had been a mistake, she withdrew the bag and disappeared momentarily into the property room, exclaiming: \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I must have missed these before.\xe2\x80\x9d She pulled a pair of $100 bills from the wallet. \xe2\x80\x9cI just looked at her,\xe2\x80\x9d White says. \xe2\x80\x9cI said: \xe2\x80\x98Ma\xe2\x80\x99am, do you really think I believe that?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After the state police cleared the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department of wrongdoing, Louis Ackal released a statement. \xe2\x80\x9cIn my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthis was a tragic loss of life, and it is difficult to understand why it happened.\xe2\x80\x9d Ackal extended \xe2\x80\x9chis deepest sympathy\xe2\x80\x9d to the White family.'b'White says that he was not surprised by what he believes happened to his son. \xe2\x80\x9cNot at all,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause I knew the type of person Louis Ackal was.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'White\xe2\x80\x99s family filed'b' a civil suit against Ackal and Ortis. (In court papers, Ackal and Ortis, who is no longer employed by the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, denied White\xe2\x80\x99s allegations. A lawyer representing the defendants declined to comment.) White shared the results of his investigation with F.B.I. agents, and he said they assured him that they would follow up on his findings. But in December 2015, 21 months after his son\xe2\x80\x99s death, the Justice Department announced that it had not found sufficient evidence \xe2\x80\x9cto prove beyond a reasonable doubt that any officer fired a weapon at Mr. White.\xe2\x80\x9d It declined to prosecute.'b'When the White family\xe2\x80\x99s attorney, Carol Powell Lexing, pushed for an explanation, the federal officers conceded that they had accepted the state police\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions at face value. Powell Lexing found this \xe2\x80\x9ccrazy,\xe2\x80\x9d because she believed that the state police had incentive to protect Ackal, their colleague for 23 years. Powell Lexing says federal officers \xe2\x80\x9cadmitted they never saw the gun. They only saw a picture of the gun in the police report. Based on a picture, how could you link it to White?\xe2\x80\x9d (At the time this article went to press, the Department of Justice had declined to provide, in response to Freedom of Information Act requests filed last May, any documents that might explain its decision. Spokespeople for the F.B.I. and the Department of Justice had no comment.)'b'While the Justice Department investigated the White case, Powell Lexing was frequently contacted by New Iberians eager to tell of abuse suffered at the hands of the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department. She forwarded these accounts to the F.B.I. White was at least the eighth person to die in custody during Sheriff Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s administration. She didn\xe2\x80\x99t think this was a coincidence.'b'Three months after declining White\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Justice Department announced it was indicting Louis Ackal on charges of deprivation of rights and conspiracy against rights \xe2\x80\x94 in about a dozen incidents unrelated to White\xe2\x80\x99s. Eight of Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s officers had pleaded guilty to civil rights violations and agreed to testify in exchange for reduced sentences. The indictment described a police department that operated like an organized-crime syndicate, with Ackal as kingpin.'b'According to court papers, Ackal ordered deputies to beat at least five pretrial detainees inside the Iberia Parish Jail. Many of the beatings took place in the prison\xe2\x80\x99s chapel \xe2\x80\x94 not because the officers had accepted God into their lives but, the indictment claimed, because the chapel was one of the few places in the prison without surveillance cameras. One inmate was targeted for making what the indictment described as a \xe2\x80\x9clewd comment,\xe2\x80\x9d another for sending letters complaining of poor conditions in the jail. An inmate accused of \xe2\x80\x9clooking\xe2\x80\x9d at a guard was attacked by a police dog, a grisly episode captured on video later leaked to the press. The indictment described an incident in which three drunk off-duty cops beat up a couple of young black men for kicks, a second in which Ackal ordered the assault of a personal rival and a third in which Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s former chief of staff, Lt. Col. Gerald Savoy, known as Bubba, was accused of having ordered the arrest of a man who punched him at a bar. His officers beat the man, shackled him to a bench and ordered him to lick his own blood off the wall.'b'The judge stripped Ackal of his gun, but he continued to serve as sheriff \xe2\x80\x94 even after, according to court papers, he was recorded threatening to shoot a federal attorney prosecuting his case, Mark Blumberg, \xe2\x80\x9cright between your [expletive] Jewish-eyes-look-like-opossum bastard.\xe2\x80\x9d Last May, after White helped to organize a protest demanding he leave office, Ackal released a one-sentence statement: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99ll be a cold day in hell when I resign.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'On a hot 'b'day last July, White joined a fledgling effort to recall Ackal. He needed to collect the signatures of 16,000 registered voters \xe2\x80\x94 about a third of the population of Iberia Parish \xe2\x80\x94 by the end of the year to put the measure on a ballot. It was a long shot, and not only because of Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s high thresholds for political recalls: Though Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s popularity had declined, he had still managed in 2015 to win a runoff election to his third consecutive term as sheriff. White did not care. He drove each weekend to New Iberia and set up a table with voter-registration forms and signature sheets in a West End parking lot. He wore a T-shirt bearing an oversize photograph of his son across his chest.'b'The parking lot, opposite a red-brick public housing development and framed by abandoned storefronts, belonged to Kevin Broussard, a barbershop owner and school-bus driver who served as the unofficial mayor of his corner of the neighborhood. \xe2\x80\x9cSo many people are afraid,\xe2\x80\x9d Broussard said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey don\xe2\x80\x99t know their rights.\xe2\x80\x9d He had voted for Ackal twice, though he grew suspicious on the night of the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s first re-election. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like a dream. He drove by in a limo, sticking a cigar out the window like Lex Luthor. I said: \xe2\x80\x98This dude has too much paper.\xe2\x80\x99 You get to be king, you don\xe2\x80\x99t think no one can stop you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Many passing through the lot spoke of regular raids by the narcotics unit, which functioned as a kind of paramilitary force within the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office. \xe2\x80\x9cThey called it \xe2\x80\x98Jump-Out Boys Days,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d Broussard said. \xe2\x80\x9cIn other words, jump out on the black boys. They\xe2\x80\x99d say: \xe2\x80\x98How much money you made this week? You made enough for me to hit you up?\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s how bold they were.\xe2\x80\x9d He said narcotics officers barged into homes without warrants, stealing most of the cash they found.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99d kick in your door, tear your house up,\xe2\x80\x9d said a large man named Whitney Lee. \xe2\x80\x9cThey would come back here with assault rifles and bulletproof vests in their little Desert Storm outfits like they\xe2\x80\x99re coming to war.\xe2\x80\x9d He gave the rueful laugh that tended to accompany discussions of the police in the West End. \xe2\x80\x9cI ain\xe2\x80\x99t going to lie, I was scared of them. Because I know they could just as soon kill me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Lee has filed a civil suit against Ackal and two of his deputies, one of 30 or so that have been filed since he took office; at least 10 have been settled, for a cumulative sum of about $1.1 million. Lee\xe2\x80\x99s suit involved an episode that occurred while he was serving time. He was taken to the recreation yard while prison officials searched his cell for contraband, and he was told to lie on the ground and put \xe2\x80\x9cyour ass in the air for your girlfriend.\xe2\x80\x9d Lee, citing his asthma, complained that he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t breathe and was beaten. (In court papers, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 lawyer denied the charges.)'b'Broussard waved a laminated paper with a photograph of Victor White III and other men who had died in custody, surrounded by photographs of the indicted officers. He had titled the page \xe2\x80\x9cOrganized Crime.\xe2\x80\x9d Beside the officers\xe2\x80\x99 heads, he had written nicknames for them. Byron Benjamin Lassalle, who pleaded guilty to forcing an inmate to fellate a baton, was Crazy Boy. Ackal was the Don. There was little known publicly about the inner workings of the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, but everyone in New Iberia was connected to everyone else; everyone had secret stories. Since his son\xe2\x80\x99s death, White had received periodic text messages from an anonymous phone number with tips from within the Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department. Oneal Davis, an officer who had recently retired from Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s department, told me the most corrupt, violent cops were the ones Ackal chose for promotion, a system that encouraged ever-increasing levels of brutality, a pyramid scheme of violence.'b'(In court papers, Ackal has denied that he failed to properly supervise the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office. The public-information officer for the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office wrote, in emailed statements: \xe2\x80\x9cIf there is a question of possible wrongdoing by members of our agency, Sheriff Ackal will welcome an independent investigation from an outside law-enforcement agency. Sheriff Ackal does not condone any illegal activities by his employees and will not hesitate to have an employee arrested if it is proved that they are involved in illegal activities.\xe2\x80\x9d The officer added that \xe2\x80\x9cSheriff Ackal strives for all of his deputies to be as professional as possible and expects them to treat every citizen within his jurisdiction equally.\xe2\x80\x9d)'b'Also pictured on Broussard\xe2\x80\x99s sheet was Michael Jones, a mentally ill inmate who, according to court papers, died after an outburst in which he ran from his cell naked and screaming. Two former officers, Wesley and Jesse Hayes, along with a former warden, slammed him to the floor, beat him, handcuffed him, put him in a chokehold and sat on top of him until he died. The Hayes brothers had a side career as Da Bayou Boys, a tag-team wrestling duo; after victories, they stuffed their opponents\xe2\x80\x99 mouths with boudin sausage. A judge awarded Jones\xe2\x80\x99s family $61,000 in a wrongful-death suit. In Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s federal case, the Hayes brothers pleaded guilty to other incidents of excessive force; Wesley filed a whistle-blower suit claiming that he was fired for reporting misconduct.'b'One of the petition organizers working with White, Khadijah Rashad, has for more than 20 years kept in a roller suitcase, locked in a secret compartment of her bedroom closet, an archive of racial violence in the parish. Ackal is the third consecutive sheriff to be taken to court on alleged civil rights violations. Before Hebert\xe2\x80\x99s stunt at the 2006 Sugar Cane Festival, his predecessor, Errol Romero, settled a lawsuit in which he and his jail warden were indicted on charges related to their forcing prisoners to sit in restraint chairs for weeks at a time, and hogtying prisoners with their mouths taped and football helmets placed backward over their heads.'b'After five hours, White was still leaping through traffic, hailing passers-by, collecting signatures. The recall event had expanded into a more general protest \xe2\x80\x94 a protest of parish history, Louisiana history, national history. \xe2\x80\x9cYou got these ignorant people in positions of power, and they\xe2\x80\x99re abusing it,\xe2\x80\x9d Whitney Lee said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey call it corruption,\xe2\x80\x9d Rashad said. \xe2\x80\x9cI call it racism.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Though neither 'b''b'the'b' Iberia parish president nor the mayor of New Iberia called for Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s removal from office, the Louisiana Sugar Cane Festival replaced his department on the security detail for last year\xe2\x80\x99s festival with officers from Youngsville, a small town 15 miles northwest. Ackal, by then, had bigger problems. He had asked the judge to reconsider the decision to confiscate his gun \xe2\x80\x9cin view of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening across the country,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to the recent shootings of police officers; two months earlier, Louisiana passed a Blue Lives Matter law, the first in the nation, which gave the police hate-crime protections. The judge was unsympathetic to Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s argument. A week before the festival, federal prosecutors added additional details to the indictment, charging that Ackal had ordered the destruction of the department\xe2\x80\x99s internal-affairs files and routinely instructed his officers to falsify police reports.'b'As the parades marched downtown, the West End was in a circumspect mood. A few blocks from Kevin Broussard\xe2\x80\x99s parking lot, three women sat in a field next to two homes and a beauty salon that had flooded to a height of four feet during the major Louisiana rain event a month earlier. The homes and the salon belonged to twin sisters named Wonderful and Wonderlynn Galentine. Repairs to the properties were funded by the West End Council of Neighborhoods Association, a nonprofit organization that serves the West End. It formed in 2008, when Ackal took office. \xe2\x80\x9cWecna is here to do those things that government is not doing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Eva Lewis, the association\xe2\x80\x99s president, who was checking on the progress to Wonderful\xe2\x80\x99s home. She was joined by Robby Carrier-Bethel, a Wecna member and second-generation activist \xe2\x80\x94 her mother, Clara Lee DeGay Carrier, a member of the school board, was the first African-American elected to office in the parish. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a huge breakdown in the West End,\xe2\x80\x9d Carrier-Bethel said. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody who lives in Iberia Parish has to bear some shame. We have to ask ourselves: How could anyone know anything and turn a blind eye?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Carrier-Bethel is pursuing a criminal-justice degree; the previous night, she stayed up late to finish a paper about Kantian moral philosophy. \xe2\x80\x9cIn order to get justice, you need to have truth.\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cChildren should not have to live in fear of law enforcement. That is the worst thing that could ever happen to a community.\xe2\x80\x9d She began to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to watch what you say and who you say it to. You have to swallow it. And you know that, as hard as you try, things are not getting better.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The women hadn\xe2\x80\x99t attended the Sugar Cane Festival for years. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat they\xe2\x80\x99re celebrating is not very respectful to what African-Americans experienced in this parish,\xe2\x80\x9d Carrier-Bethel said, measuring her words. As recently as the late 1960s, some sugar-plantation workers were paid in scrip that could be exchanged only at plantation-owned stores. \xe2\x80\x9cThe history is not the scary part. It\xe2\x80\x99s the ignorance of the history. You hope that things change, but when you go to a parade and you see a sea of whiteness, it reminds you that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a lack of respect for who you are as a person. Until we begin to be brutally honest about what is happening in our parish \xe2\x80\x94 what is happening in America \xe2\x80\x94 it will always be a sea of whiteness.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Across town, following'b' the 4-H Live Stock Show and Sale and the Blessing of the Crops, the 75th annual Sugar Cane Festival reached its culmination with the coronation of Queen Sugar. The pageant was held at the festival\xe2\x80\x99s own theater in City Park, which quickly filled to capacity. The men wore oxford shirts in shades of violet, gray and white, with ties and without jackets; the women wore pearls, floral-patterned gowns, bouffant hair. Some had brooches identifying them as \xe2\x80\x9cFormer Queen Sugar.\xe2\x80\x9d The atmosphere was galvanized, giddy. It seemed that everyone knew nearly everyone else. It seemed that every single person was white.'b''b'The curtain opened on the Sugar Lumps, a troupe of middle-aged women dressed in black spandex and emerald sequin vests performing a synchronized dance to Pitbull\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cCelebrate.\xe2\x80\x9d On the stage behind them, stands of sugar cane were set against silver draping. In the center stood a throne for King Sucrose and Queen Sugar, who magnanimously waved their scepters.'b'There followed a procession of visiting queens: Miss Cajun Hot Sauce Queen, Miss Creole Gumbo Queen, Miss Crawfish Queen, Miss Gonzales Jambalaya Queen. After the entrance of the three judges, each a representative of the sugar industry, the contestants for Queen Sugar introduced themselves:'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the sugar cane grows in all directions, and our two mills process it in sweet confections, the cane may be much taller than me, but I can promise you that I\xe2\x80\x99m just as sweet. Proudly representing Assumption Parish, I am \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to make your life sooo sweet, when you shake it on down to sugar town. Feel free to stomp your feet to that good old Cajun beat. Proudly representing Terrebonne Parish, I am \xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The daughters of the old planter families held elaborate curtsies while announcers read their biographical statements. When asked whom they would most like to meet, three contestants chose Jean \xc3\x89tienne de Bor\xc3\xa9, who made sugar cane commercially viable in Louisiana in 1795.'b'At last the M.C. requested the envelope. The contestants smiled bravely. The audience quivered in anticipation. The winner was announced: Caroline Marcello of Lafourche Parish. She was handed a bouquet of roses, a silver tiara with bejeweled sugar-cane stalks, a cape embroidered with glittering white petals. The audience stood as one. In the back row, an ecstatic woman tried to get the attention of an elderly man beside her. He was confused; he had not heard the result.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe won!\xe2\x80\x9d the woman shouted, putting her arms around the man\xe2\x80\x99s neck. \xe2\x80\x9cShe won! We won!\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'In late October, 'b'five days before the trial was set to begin, Bubba Savoy pleaded guilty to striking an inmate in the testicles with his baton, leaving only Ackal to stand trial. During his officers\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, Ackal sat passively, spitting tobacco into a foam cup. Narcotics officers testified that Ackal encouraged them to terrorize the West End, lie in depositions to cover up excessive use of force and beat whomever they liked. \xe2\x80\x9cHe wanted to take the streets back from the [expletive],\xe2\x80\x9d said the former narcotics officer Marion Borel. \xe2\x80\x9cThey were animals,\xe2\x80\x9d explained a former deputy, Jason Comeaux, \xe2\x80\x9cand they needed to be treated like animals.\xe2\x80\x9d He recalled an interrogation in which a supervising officer pointed at a discoloration on the floor and told the suspect: \xe2\x80\x9cYou see that stain there? That\xe2\x80\x99s from the last [expletive] I shot.\xe2\x80\x9d When asked how it felt, beating up black people, a former officer named Jacob Huckaby called it \xe2\x80\x9cliberating, I guess, to have a little extra power on somebody.\xe2\x80\x9d One federal prosecutor estimated that hundreds of victims had been beaten on Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s watch.'b'The deputies testified for four days. On the fifth day, Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer, John McLindon, argued that the narcotics unit was a rogue division within the department, operating without Ackal\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. He said that no one ever claimed that Ackal himself beat an inmate.'b'After four hours of deliberation, the jury found Ackal not guilty on all counts. \xe2\x80\x9cGod bless it,\xe2\x80\x9d Ackal said, after court was adjourned. \xe2\x80\x9cOur judicial system worked today.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Carol Powell Lexing was poleaxed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got the most corrupt Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s Department in the state of Louisiana, probably in the country, and you have the deputies testify about all the corruption \xe2\x80\x94 and he still gets off. It\xe2\x80\x99s totally incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d She denied that she was discouraged about her own case, which is scheduled for trial in August. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel encouraged, more than ever. Because now you have the deputies\xe2\x80\x99 testimony about the culture of corruption and violence in the department.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'White was stunned. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t understand how the jury could have acquitted,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like they weren\xe2\x80\x99t paying attention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The effort to recall Ackal failed to secure enough signatures by the deadline. As White awaits the civil trial, he continues to organize protests against Ackal through an organization he has formed to fight police brutality. It\xe2\x80\x99s called Justice for Victor White. I asked whether he thought justice for his son was possible. \xe2\x80\x9cTrue justice,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be to bring my son\xe2\x80\x99s life back.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ackal, meanwhile, was triumphant. He spoke of cleaning house, of greater transparency. He emphasized the need for better relations between the police and the West End. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re losing our black children,\xe2\x80\x9d he told a reporter.'b'Then he returned to the sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s office, where he was given back his gun.'b''b''b''b''b''b'O'b'n an overcast winter morning, Charles Vigliotti, chief executive of American Organic Energy, drove me to his 62-acre lot in rural Yaphank, N.Y., 60 miles east of Manhattan, to show me his vision of the future of alternative energy. He snaked his company Jeep around tall piles of wood chips, sandy loam and dead leaves. Then, with a sudden turn, we shot up the side of a 30-foot bluff of soil. At the top, we gazed down upon those many piles and breathed in the mildly sulfurous exhalations of a nearby dump. Vigliotti radiated enthusiasm. Within the next several months, he expected to break ground \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cright there,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, thrusting his index finger toward a two-acre clearing \xe2\x80\x94 on a massive $50 million anaerobic digester, a high-tech plant that would transform into clean energy a rich reserve that until recently has gone largely untapped: food waste.'b'This resource, Vigliotti knew, had a lot going for it. Like oil and coal, kitchen scraps can be converted into energy. But unlike oil and coal, which are expensive to dig out of the ground, food waste is something that cities will actually pay someone to haul away. Many innovative municipalities, in an effort to keep organic material out of dumps \xe2\x80\x94 where it generates methane, a greenhouse gas \xe2\x80\x94 already separate food from garbage and send it to old-fashioned compost facilities. There, workers pile the waste in linear heaps called windrows, mix it with leaves and grass clippings and let oxygen-dependent microbes transform the gunk into lovely dark fertilizer. But the more material you compost, the more space (and gas-guzzling bulldozers and windrow turners) you need to process it. It can get a little smelly, too, which is yet another reason New York City, which generates about one million tons of organic waste a year, will probably never host giant compost farms.'b'But anaerobic digestion, in which food is broken down by microbes inside tall, airtight silos, has a real shot at scaling near densely populated areas. The footprint of such plants is relatively small, and their odors are mechanically contained, if they are operated properly. Digesters do cost more to build and run than compost sites, but they more than make up for that by generating two separate revenue streams: fertilizer and biogas, which is chemically similar to natural gas and can be burned to make heat and electricity.'b'To hear Vigliotti explain it, the supply of feedstock for his anaerobic digester was unending, a veritable geyser of potential profit flowing from every part of the food chain: orphaned produce from wholesale markets, the crusty remains of all-you-can-eat buffets, fryer oil, kitchen grease and gloopy residential plate scrapings. All of this was simply waiting to be tapped by someone with the chutzpah and the capital to convert it into a product \xe2\x80\x94 renewable energy \xe2\x80\x94 for which there is unending demand. Vigliotti\xe2\x80\x99s only real cost, not inconsiderable, was refining. And lawyers. \xe2\x80\x9cWe face a staggering level of regulatory approval,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me.'b'In the crunchy-granola world of urban compost, populated by outdoorsy types in Carhartts and work boots, Vigliotti stands out. He wears designer suits and a pinkie ring, slicks back his hair \xc3\xa0 la L.B.J. and commutes from his Oyster Bay home in a silver Porsche Panamera. The nephew of Vincent Vigliotti, an established Bronx trash carter, Charles spent the 1970s hanging off the back of a commercial garbage truck working the streets of Jackson Heights, Queens. \xe2\x80\x9cMy uncle\xe2\x80\x99s carting business and my carting business were completely separate,\xe2\x80\x9d Vigliotti told me, twice, the first time we met. (Later, I understood why: His uncle pleaded guilty in 1997 to charges of attempted racketeering, which stemmed from his participation in a Mafia-dominated cartel.)'b'Over the years, Vigliotti, who is 63, gradually evolved from a hauler of waste to a producer of fine fertilizers. And so he was well positioned when New York City contracted last year with six companies to transform the food waste it currently collects from the curbsides of almost a million residents. Four of those companies will send their scraps to traditional compost facilities. A fifth will truck its share to the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, operated by the New York City Department of Environmental Protection in north Brooklyn. There, chopped-up food will be stirred into giant tanks that already digest sewage, anaerobically, using microbes; the resulting biogas will be captured and used to power turbines on site or to heat nearby homes. Vigliotti\xe2\x80\x99s contract, the second-largest, allows him to annually shunt more than 23,000 tons of city food waste into his soon-to-be-built Yaphank plant, where it will mingle with 155,000 tons of scraps from two counties outside the city. When it is up and running, American Organic Energy will have the largest anaerobic digester east of the Mississippi. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to say I had a vision of environmental responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d Vigliotti told me, with a wink, about the origins of his new endeavor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I saw food composting as a business opportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Throughout the modern'b' era of waste collection, New Yorkers, like other Americans, have been asked to pull all kinds of things from their kitchen trash cans for a supposedly higher purpose than burial at the dump. First it was paper, metal and plastic, then electronic goods and, in some places, textiles. Now we increasingly separate food waste. Sometimes we know where these recyclables will eventually alight \xe2\x80\x94 junk mail may be converted to printer paper, for example \xe2\x80\x94 but mostly we remain in the dark. There has always been an aura of mystery to these flows, in part because markets for recyclables continually change. For those who voluntarily set out food scraps for municipal collection \xe2\x80\x94 true believers, that is \xe2\x80\x94 the process provokes yet another layer of uncertainty. We assume our dregs are headed for a giant compost pile somewhere, but what happens to it next?'b'For a brief time, I could provide answers to such questions. As my own compost baron, I sorted and tipped my grapefruit rinds and eggshells into a front-yard composting bin; the resulting fertilizer fed my building\xe2\x80\x99s crab-apple tree. But when I ran out of leaves to mix into the scraps, my \xe2\x80\x9ccompost\xe2\x80\x9d grew extremely smelly. Odors, flies and quality control can bedevil even the most experienced food-waste recyclers, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up. Instead, a few years ago, I upgraded from a solo operation to something just a little bigger, joining the 200,000 other New Yorkers who weekly marched their organics to one of 74 drop-off sites \xe2\x80\x94 at farmers\xe2\x80\x99 markets, subway stations, libraries \xe2\x80\x94 around New York City, collectively diverting 2.3 million pounds of food waste from the dump each year.'b'Lugging scraps to my farmers market was enormously satisfying. I liked returning my potato peels to the woman who grew my potatoes; I knew she\xe2\x80\x99d make good use of them. The act also felt more immediately important than many other things I did to lessen my planetary impact, like driving less and line-drying more. When the Department of Sanitation\xe2\x80\x99s curbside organics-collection program expanded to my Brooklyn neighborhood in 2015, I was grateful, but also a little wary. Placing my scraps on the curb in a securely latched, hard-sided bin was certainly convenient, but my compost cycle was starting to spiral, from small-batch to medium to \xe2\x80\x94 well, I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t sure what. I had no idea where this centralized system deposited my scraps, or how \xe2\x80\x94 or if \xe2\x80\x94 they were transformed into something of value.'b'By 2018, the Department of Sanitation hopes to extend its curbside program \xe2\x80\x94 the largest residential-food-waste collection scheme in the country \xe2\x80\x94 citywide. But quantity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t always equal quality, and already there is evidence that an industrial future may not match the integrity of the artisanal present. Longer supply chains mean burning more fuel to transport this resource, and recipients of scraps have little control over what New Yorkers throw into their bins. Because local composters, at urban farms, educate their suppliers, they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to remove plastic bags, twist-ties and other detritus from their feedstock. But the anonymity of industrial-scale operations means that such contaminants can easily slide through.'b'When New York\xe2\x80\x99s curbside program began several years ago, trucks trundled city scraps down the New Jersey Turnpike to the Peninsula Compost Company, a large facility in Wilmington, Del. But after Waste Management, the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest solid-waste handler, bought a controlling interest in the plant six years ago, its compost quality declined \xe2\x80\x94 it contained too many shards of glass and pieces of plastic \xe2\x80\x94 and neighbors began to complain that the yard smelled like the bottom of a garbage pail. Environmental regulators forced Peninsula to shut down in 2014.'b'Since then, the city has been carting food waste to several local transfer stations, one of which I visited in Jamaica, Queens. Inside a dreary industrial shed at a private company called Regal Recycling, a team of workers in rubber boots and face masks combed through a 10-foot-tall pile of organic waste collected from various schools. Using long-handled hoes and their gloved fingers, the men painstakingly extracted plastic baggies, milk boxes, Capri Sun pouches, sporks and balls of aluminum foil. (As the volume of curbside organics climbs, Regal and other city transfer stations will install mechanical preprocessing equipment.)'b'Michael Reali, Regal\xe2\x80\x99s vice president, told me the city paid him about $80 a ton to receive this material, and then he paid truckers to transport the waste upstate and a permitted composter $35 per ton to receive it. Sometimes the load was clean, sometimes not. Reali pivoted away from the school waste and gestured toward a 20-foot mound shoved against the opposite wall. Collected from two fruit wholesalers, the pile was almost 100 percent mangoes and avocados, with very little extraneous material. (And it smelled great.) I was starting to understand that compost, like oil, has different grades. Pure commercial streams like this one were akin to West Texas light crude: clean and easy to process. School and residential streams were like tar sands: dirty and expensive to upgrade.'b'Reali\xe2\x80\x99s decontaminated table scraps eventually made their way to McEnroe Organic Farm, which stretches over 1,100-acres of rolling pastureland and cultivated fields in the mid-Hudson Valley. There I watched as front-end loaders mixed the food with locally sourced wood shavings and straw. The woody materials provided more carbon to complement the food\xe2\x80\x99s nitrogen and bulk up the compost. Thoroughly mingled, the compost was then laid in rows and covered by a fleece blanket to cook; heat killed any pathogens and weed seeds. Twice a week for a month, workers remove the blankets and spider a mechanical windrow turner over the top, fluffing and mixing. After resting for several more months, the compost is fed into a screening machine. About 60 percent of McEnroe\xe2\x80\x99s 28,000 tons of finished material nourishes the farm, which raises organic vegetables, grains and pastured meat. The rest, selling for up to $100 a cubic yard, helps balance its books.'b'The nation\xe2\x80\x99s industrialized compost operations bring in roughly $3 billion annually; American farmers bought $21.2 billion of conventional fertilizers in 2016. I liked being part of this smaller economy, though. McEnroe\xe2\x80\x99s adorable Angus calves and grain-filled silos made it easy to imagine that my waste was circling virtuously, even as I blocked out the miserable labors of the transfer station downstate. The system worked, I liked to think. Compost could scale up; food could return to being food.'b'Then I got on the phone with Will Brinton, who runs the Woods End Laboratories in Mount Vernon, Me., and has spent his entire career studying the science of rot. Several years ago, Brinton began comparing the costs and benefits of composting food with those of anaerobically digesting it. He assumed that composting would come out on top. But, Brinton said, \xe2\x80\x9cI was horrified to see, at the end of the study, that we were investing more carbon in making compost than the compost returned to the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d All those energy-sucking bulldozers and trucks and augers and screeners were taking their toll. Biogas created by anaerobically digesting corncobs and orange peels, in contrast, was carbon neutral. That\xe2\x80\x99s because the plant generates its own energy, and burning the fuel doesn\xe2\x80\x99t release new carbon into the atmosphere, as burning oil or coal does; it merely recycles the carbon already inside those scraps. Take the calculations a step further, by subtracting the methane that would have been generated by putting this food waste in landfills, and biofuel could be considered carbon negative.'b'In recognition of these facts, the Environmental Protection Agency now lists anaerobic digestion as preferable to composting when it comes to surplus food (of course, feeding surpluses to people, followed by animals, is even better). Even the U.S. Composting Council, a trade group, acknowledges anaerobic digestion\xe2\x80\x99s beneficial role in producing energy.'b''b'At first,'b' I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what to make of Charles Vigliotti. You seldom hear the words \xe2\x80\x9cwealthy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomposter\xe2\x80\x9d strung together. But as he explained his roundabout path to the energy sector, I began to sense Vigliotti\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to solving some serious environmental problems, even as he lined his silky pockets.'b'After city landfills began closing in the 1980s, Vigliotti found he was spending too much money directing waste out of state. He began to move away from the trash business and in 1991 established with his brother Arnold a compost company in Westbury, N.Y., that transforms Himalayas of landscape debris \xe2\x80\x94 grass clippings, leaves, wood chips \xe2\x80\x94 into millions of bags of lawn and garden products. Business was good, but Vigliotti remained restless. In 1999, he opened a compost site in Yaphank, where in 2008 he began dabbling in food waste, mixing scraps from a Whole Foods Market and a small-batch won-ton manufacturer into his formula for potting soils. At this point, Vigliotti wasn\xe2\x80\x99t thinking of food waste as a renewable energy source or a way to reduce the city\xe2\x80\x99s far-flung garbage footprint or greenhouse-gas emissions. It was simply a way to take in more volume and thus make more money.'b'Vigliotti initially composted his food scraps using a basic windrow technology similar to McEnroe\xe2\x80\x99s. That was fine for bakery waste and those won tons. But when he began accepting meat, fish, oils and road-killed deer, he ran into trouble: The site now produced eye-watering odors and attracted blankets of gulls. After a multiyear battle with angry locals, who supported organics recycling in theory but had little patience for its stinky reality, Vigliotti and other stakeholders devised a remedy. Instead of composting food in windrows, he would digest it in tanks. But in order to justify the expense of building those tanks, Vigliotti would need to attract more food scraps. And if those came from households in addition to commercial establishments, he would need a lot of fancy equipment to screen out the sort of contaminants that bedeviled Reali\xe2\x80\x99s laborers in Queens and Waste Management\xe2\x80\x99s workers at Peninsula in Delaware.'b'And so the project grew. Today, American Organic Energy is supported by $45 million in borrowed capital, plus grants from the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority ($1.35 million) and Empire State Development ($400,000).'b'Gazing down from that high bluff of soil in Yaphank, Vigliotti laid out the mechanics of his new anaerobic operation. \xe2\x80\x9cThe trucks are going to pull into a two-acre building and dump their load into a 10-foot-deep pit,\xe2\x80\x9d he explained. Air pressure inside would be lower than outside, so no odors would escape. Next, expensive German machinery would crush the cans and bottles that would inevitably ride in with the food; metals would be extracted and packages shredded, and with the addition of water, random plastic would float to the top of the tanks while glass and grit settled to the bottom. \xe2\x80\x9cWe know we\xe2\x80\x99re gonna get loads from supermarkets with unopened tuna cans and expired bacon packages,\xe2\x80\x9d Vigliotti said, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile residential food is going to be in a plastic bag with a soup can of broken glass in it \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s the way Americans throw out their garbage.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Vigliotti wasn\xe2\x80\x99t bothered. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not changing human nature but building our plant to suit it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. His philosophy was diametrically opposed to that of community composters, who insist that participants honor and defend the integrity of their organics, down to the removal of tiny stickers from lemons and limes. And for the most part, they do. But it was clear to me now that these artisanal operations \xe2\x80\x94 even if they do expand to schools, parks and other city-owned spaces with support from local government \xe2\x80\x94 will never be able to handle the boroughs\xe2\x80\x99 tsunami of residential food waste. (Nor do they particularly want to.)'b'Once isolated, Vigliotti\xe2\x80\x99s organic material will move into six three-story tanks, where it will stew for 20 days, producing enough biogas to generate nearly 50 million kilowatt-hours of electricity a year. Twenty percent of the output will feed the plant\xe2\x80\x99s electrical demand; PSE&amp;G, a local electrical utility, will be able to buy the rest (unless American Organic Energy compresses its biogas to run trucks). Vigliotti won\xe2\x80\x99t reveal his per-ton processing costs or his expected revenue, but he noted that selling the gas alone will bring in \xe2\x80\x9cseven figures,\xe2\x80\x9d even with the commodity\xe2\x80\x99s price near a 10-year low because of the fracking boom.'b'But gas isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only thing that American Organic Energy plans to sell. When the microbes are done feasting, Vigliotti continued, they\xe2\x80\x99ll leave behind a watery digestate that machines will squeeze and separate into solids and liquids. Vigliotti will blend the solids with woody material \xe2\x80\x94 the stuff arrayed at our feet, of which he had an endless supply \xe2\x80\x94 and aerobically compost the mixture in windrows, then sell the resulting 40,000 tons per year of potting soil to regional garden centers through a deal with Scotts Miracle-Gro. Partnering with G.E. Water &amp; Process Technologies, he will put the leftover liquids through a multistage filtering process, after which American Organic Energy will reuse the clean portion on site and sell the fraction that\xe2\x80\x99s high in ammonium sulfate \xe2\x80\x94 a projected 912,500 gallons a year \xe2\x80\x94 as plant food (around $20 for two and a half gallons, retail). \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll be targeting the affluent urban market with that,\xe2\x80\x9d Vigliotti said.'b''b'Earlier this year,'b' Vigliotti received the last of his state permits, and he was hoping to break ground on his plant this spring. But he continued to talk up American Organic Energy to any civic group that would have him. I caught one of these presentations the previous year at a meeting of the Brooklyn Solid Waste Advisory Board, which convened at Brooklyn Borough Hall. After walking the audience of laypeople and waste experts through his blueprints, he explained that digestion beats composting because it generates energy, and that digesting his way trumped digesting inside a wastewater-treatment plant because that plant\xe2\x80\x99s back-end digestate contained sewage, plus traces of many other materials \xe2\x80\x94 including industrial waste and heavy metals \xe2\x80\x94 that go down city pipes. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t market the end product!\xe2\x80\x9d he barked.'b'Nothing, it seemed, could stand in Vigliotti\xe2\x80\x99s way. He was nearly levitating from his Italian loafers when he wrapped up his presentation with a sweeping offer. \xe2\x80\x9cIf the city gives us a site in the boroughs,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will build and operate a plant that handles 1,000 tons of food waste per day, and we will process it at rates lower than what anyone else is offering.\xe2\x80\x9d The room grew quiet. A thousand tons is the amount generated daily by all of the city\xe2\x80\x99s institutional and commercial food establishments combined.'b'Was Vigliotti serious? \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolutely,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. With his network of corporate partners, he dreamed of building beautifully managed, energy-producing digesters on smallish city plots across the nation. Here in New York, he added, his words tumbling ahead of his thoughts, \xe2\x80\x9cwe could put together a proposal that would make everyone\xe2\x80\x99s eyeballs and bells ring, and a bunch of carbon footprint stuff, compressed-natural-gas trucks. ...\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd nodded, caught up in his enthusiasm for a food-waste-fueled clean-energy future. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone here knows there is more material in this city than 10 facilities like ours could handle,\xe2\x80\x9d Vigliotti said, rather sternly. Then he packed up his schematic diagrams and headed for his Porsche.'b''b''b''b''b''b'O'b'n a recent October morning in the White House mailroom, on the ground floor of the Executive Office Building just beside a loading dock, 10 interns sat at two long tables, each trying to get through 300 letters. Grab a bundle, sit down and read. It was pretty straightforward: Read. A girl doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want her mom to be deported, and can the president please help? A guy finally admits to his wife that he\xe2\x80\x99s gay, and now he would like to tell the president. A car dealer writes to say his bank is shutting him down, and thanks for nothing, Mr. President. A vet who can\xe2\x80\x99t stop seeing what he saw in Iraq writes a barely intelligible rant that makes his point all the more intelligible: \xe2\x80\x9cHelp.\xe2\x80\x9d An inmate admits to selling crack to all those people but he wants the president to know he is not a lost cause: \xe2\x80\x9cI have dreams Mr. President, big dreams.\xe2\x80\x9d A man can\xe2\x80\x99t find a job. A woman can\xe2\x80\x99t find a job. A teacher with advanced certification can\xe2\x80\x99t find a damn job. A lesbian couple just got married; thank you, Mr. President. A man sends his medical bills, a woman sends her student-loan statements, a child sends her drawing of a cat, a mother sends her teenager\xe2\x80\x99s report card \xe2\x80\x94 straight A\xe2\x80\x99s, isn\xe2\x80\x99t that awesome, Mr. President?'b'This pile, that pile, another pile over there; pull from the middle if you want. The narrative was sloppy and urgent, America talking all at once. No filter. The handwriting, the ink, the choice of letterhead \xe2\x80\x94 every letter was a real object from a real person, and now you were holding it, and so now you were responsible for it.'b'At the beginning of his first term, President Obama said he wanted to read his mail. He said he would like to see 10 letters a day. After that, the 10LADs, as they came to be called, were put in a purple folder and added to the back of the briefing book he took with him to the residence on the second floor of the White House each night.'b'Choosing which letters made it to the president started here in the Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House, in the \xe2\x80\x9chard-mail room,\xe2\x80\x9d which had the tired, unkempt look of a college study hall during finals \xe2\x80\x94 paper everywhere, files stacked along walls, bundles under tables, boxes propping up computer monitors dotted with Post-its, cables hanging. Hushed young men in ties and hushed young women in sweater sets and hose \xe2\x80\x94 you dress up if you work for the White House \xe2\x80\x94 held pencils between their teeth or behind their ears, all of them with their heads bent, reading. There was an equally crowded work space, \xe2\x80\x9cthe email room,\xe2\x80\x9d in a satellite office just outside the White House gates on Jackson Place. All in all, the Office of Presidential Correspondence \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cO.P.C.\xe2\x80\x9d was what everyone called it \xe2\x80\x94 required the orchestration of 50 staff members, 36 interns and a rotating roster of 300 volunteers to keep up with about 10,000 letters and messages every day.'b'Anyone could nominate a letter or email for inclusion in the day\xe2\x80\x99s 10LADs. They called it \xe2\x80\x9csampling.\xe2\x80\x9d To sample a letter in the hard-mail room, you just wrote \xe2\x80\x9csample\xe2\x80\x9d (in pencil) on the top left corner of a letter, and then you walked it over and dropped it in the wooden inbox with a sticker on it that said \xe2\x80\x9cSamples.\xe2\x80\x9d About 2 percent of the total incoming mail ended up there. Did the letter move you in some particular way? Don\xe2\x80\x99t overthink it. Sample it. The bar was kept deliberately low. These were 'b'people'b' writing, and you\xe2\x80\x99re a 'b'person'b' reading, and the president is a 'b'person.'b' Just keep remembering that, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll be fine.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou get attached,\xe2\x80\x9d Jamira Chick, an intern, told me. She had her hair bundled tightly on top of her head and wore a pretty print top. She said that one time she opened a letter from a woman who was writing the president to say she had lost a family member to gun violence. \xe2\x80\x9cShe had enclosed photos,\xe2\x80\x9d Chick said. \xe2\x80\x9cJust blood all over in a car. ... \xe2\x80\x9d She tapped her eraser on the table, up and down on the table.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverybody has that one letter,\xe2\x80\x9d the staff member in charge of the interns, Yena Bae, told me. The letters could take a toll. Unlike most other shops at the White House, O.P.C. offered monthly counseling sessions to anyone who felt the need.'b'Besides deciding whether to set a letter aside for the president to read, you had to code it. Every letter. Code it with a \xe2\x80\x9cdisposition,\xe2\x80\x9d on the top left corner (again, in pencil). 'b'Gun violence; health care; drone strikes; domestic violence; Ukraine; taxes.'b' Put your initials under the code. Code a stack, then stand up to stretch your neck and your legs and take your stack over to \xe2\x80\x9cthe wall,\xe2\x80\x9d a tan shelving unit stuffed with paper, labeled shelf after shelf with corresponding dispositions. 'b'Gitmo; mortgage crisis; immigration; bees.'b' (Bees?) The codes corresponded to more than 100 different form-response letters from the president that the O.P.C. writing team, a group of nine, worked to constantly update. Meantime, all the letters from kids went into a separate bin, to be picked up by the kid team upstairs; requests for birthday, anniversary and baby acknowledgments went to the greetings team; gifts went to the gifts team. A casework team of six across the hall handled letters that required individual attention from a federal agency. Maybe someone needed help getting benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, for example; a caseworker could step in and investigate. Two more codes to be aware of: \xe2\x80\x9cSensitive\xe2\x80\x9d meant someone was writing to the president about a loss, a sickness or other personal trauma. Those went over to Jack Cumming, a quiet guy in beige and the occasional shy grin who spent his days reading letters of condolence from the president, and who often needed a break from the unbearable sadness, and so he liked to hang out in the hard-mail room. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s nice to come in here and just ... read,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'The most important code everyone needed to know about was \xe2\x80\x9cred dot.\xe2\x80\x9d A red dot was an emergency. These were from people writing to the president to say they wanted to kill themselves, or someone else, or they seemed in some way on the edge; if you were wondering if you should write \xe2\x80\x9cred dot\xe2\x80\x9d on a letter, you probably should, and then you immediately walked that one across the hall and gave it to Lacey Higley, the woman in the back corner more or less in charge of rescuing people.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you need a break?\xe2\x80\x9d Bae asked me, whispering, as you do in the hard-mail room. She was sitting with us, flipping through letters faster than us, scribbling. Like all the O.P.C. staff members, she was young, mid-20s; she had carefree, shiny long brown hair, and she wore two rings, a regular band in the regular place and then a thin silver one sitting above a knuckle for flair. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you need cookies? We have cookies.\xe2\x80\x9d She reached for a tub of oatmeal-raisins and slid it. I asked her if she had a letter that haunted her.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was from a mother who missed her son,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She pushed her hair behind her ears. The son had been kidnapped, and the investigation was underway. Bae read the letter a dozen times, stunned by details in it that for reasons of O.P.C. confidentiality she could not reveal to me. \xe2\x80\x9cEverything was hush-hush.\xe2\x80\x9d She told me she alerted the authorities, then felt helpless because there was nothing more she could do. \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d Weeks later, she learned that the son had been killed. She came in to the office and sat at her computer and sobbed. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if his mom wrote again?\xe2\x80\x9d She told me the experience changed the direction of her life and her sense of her place in the world.'b'Chick was leaning in to hear Bae tell the story of the mother and the lost son. She had put her pencil down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s weird I\xe2\x80\x99m going to go from this to being back at school,\xe2\x80\x9d Chick said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s hard to explain all this to my friends.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou can\xe2\x80\x99t,\xe2\x80\x9d Bae said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI never thought about how powerful a letter was.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDid you even know we had a correspondence office before you came here?\xe2\x80\x9d Bae asked her.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI had no idea.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou think you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be the mail lady or something.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re in the mailroom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe mailroom.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'On a whiteboard was the countdown: \xe2\x80\x9cYou have 99 days to make a difference in the life of a letter writer,\xe2\x80\x9d referring to Jan. 19, 2017, the last day of the Obama administration and the last day for this O.P.C. staff, nearly all of whom were political appointees and would no longer have a job at the White House. The election was less than a month away, and Donald Trump was still trailing Hillary Clinton by 8 points, according to the polls. \xe2\x80\x9cOur time is, like, ticking,\xe2\x80\x9d Bae told me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to put our letter-writers in good shape for the next administration. We want them to be in good hands.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Presidents have dealt'b' with constituent mail differently over the years. It started simply enough: George Washington opened the mail and answered it. He got about five letters a day. Mail back then was carried by foot, or on horseback or in stagecoaches \xe2\x80\x94 not a high volume. Then came steamboats, then rail and a modernized postal system, and by the end of the 19th century President William McKinley was overwhelmed. One hundred letters every day? He hired someone to help, and that was the origin of O.P.C. It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t until the Great Depression that things got especially tricky. In his weekly fireside chats, Franklin D. Roosevelt began a tradition of speaking directly to the country, inviting people to write to him and tell him their troubles. About a half-million letters came pouring in during the first week, and the White House mailroom became a fire hazard. Constituent mail grew from there, and each succeeding president formed a relationship with it. By the end of his presidency, Nixon refused to read anything bad anyone said about him. Reagan answered dozens of letters on weekends; he would stop by the mailroom from time to time, and he enjoyed reading the kid mail. Clinton wanted to see a representative stack every few weeks. George W. Bush liked to get a pile of 10 already-answered letters on occasion. These, anyway, are the anecdotal memories you find from former staff members. Little hard data exists about constituent mail from previous administrations; historians don\xe2\x80\x99t focus on it, presidential libraries don\xe2\x80\x99t feature it; the vast majority of it has long since been destroyed.'b'President Obama was the first to come up with a deliberate and explicit practice of 10 letters every day. If the president was home at the White House (he did not tend to mail when he traveled), he would be reading constituent mail, and everyone knew it, and systems were put in place to make sure it happened. The mail had currency. Some staff members called it \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter underground.\xe2\x80\x9d Starting in 2010, all hard mail would be scanned and preserved. Starting in 2011, every email every day would be used to create a word cloud, its image distributed around the White House so policy makers and staff members alike could get a glimpse at what everyday Americans were writing in to say.'b'So much of the mail in the beginning of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s presidency was about economic hardship and helplessness. There was a feeling of dread about climate change, and a loss of faith in everything from government to banks to the Catholic Church. Here was the new guy who said he could fix things. It was the getting-to-know-you phase. They told him their problems. They told him to quit smoking. They told him, wow, a black guy in the White House. They told him to get Bin Laden. They told him to create jobs. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see if you\xe2\x80\x99re as smart as we hope you are.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The tone of the letters was the main difference that Annmarie Emmet, a volunteer and a retiree, told me she saw. She read mail all through most of Bush\xe2\x80\x99s two terms in office, then stayed on. \xe2\x80\x9cWith Bush it would be more like, \xe2\x80\x98Why aren\xe2\x80\x99t you helping these people as a group, or doing more for that group?\xe2\x80\x99 As opposed to personal struggles. I would say they felt a more personal connection with the Obamas. Kind of like, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m like you were, I need your help.\xe2\x80\x99 And then from the beginning the L.G.B.T.Q. people have flocked to him. You never saw that in the Bush administration.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In 2009, Natoma Canfield, a cancer survivor from Medina, Ohio, wrote in detailing her staggering health insurance premiums, a letter Obama would keep framed and hung in a corridor between his private study and the Oval Office. \xe2\x80\x9cI need your health reform bill to help me!!! I simply can no longer afford to pay for my health care costs!!\xe2\x80\x9d It stood in for the tens of thousands of similar letters the mailroom was handling on the health care issue alone. They saw spikes in volume after major events like the mass shootings in Newtown, Conn., and Charleston, S.C.; the Paris terrorist attacks; the government shutdown; Benghazi. You could see it in the word clouds. \xe2\x80\x9cJobs\xe2\x80\x9d might grow for a time, or \xe2\x80\x9cSyria,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cTrayvon,\xe2\x80\x9d or a cluster like \xe2\x80\x9cfamily-children-fear\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwork-loans-student\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cISIS-money-war\xe2\x80\x9d surrounding a giant \xe2\x80\x9cHelp,\xe2\x80\x9d the most common word of all. After a gunman opened fire on police officers in Dallas last year, the word \xe2\x80\x9cpolice\xe2\x80\x9d ballooned, surrounded by \xe2\x80\x9cGod-guns-black-America\xe2\x80\x9d with a tiny \xe2\x80\x9cpeace\xe2\x80\x9d and even tinier \xe2\x80\x9cCongress.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Obama started commuting prison sentences, a large influx of inmate mail followed. There were scores of regulars writing in. Like the woman who emailed, daily, asking to become the ambassador to Cuba. (She quit after Shaquille O\xe2\x80\x99Neal got the sports-envoy gig.) If one issue remained constant, a solid drumbeat, it was gun violence.'b'The conversation happening in the mail did not always align with the one the White House may have been advancing. \xe2\x80\x9cFor years and years, sentencing disparities and criminal-justice-reform issues were coming a lot into hard mail, because that\xe2\x80\x99s often the last-resort channel,\xe2\x80\x9d Fiona Reeves told me. She was the director of O.P.C., in charge of everything. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was this feeling like only we knew about it.\xe2\x80\x9d The letters made their way to Obama \xe2\x80\x94 Reeves decided to include inmates in his nightly reading, ending a standard practice among modern administrations of ignoring inmate mail, or forwarding it to the Justice Department without a response from the president. In 2014, when the administration rolled out a Justice Department program offering executive relief to federal prisoners serving long sentences for nonviolent drug crimes, it surprised no one in the mailroom. The president, they were happy to see, was reading the mail.'b'There was a similar trajectory with issues around same-sex marriage and repealing the military\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t ask, don\xe2\x80\x99t tell\xe2\x80\x9d policy. These conversations happened in the mail whether or not they happened anywhere else at the White House. The guy who wrote in anonymously in 2009 about his partner in Iraq wrote again in 2014, and this time he used his name.'b''b'When I met 'b'with Reeves, she was sitting on the blue couch in her office on the fourth floor of the Executive Office Building, surrounded by letters, all potential 10LADs. Chief among her duties was sorting through the samples each day, roughly 200 or 300 of them between the ones the hard-mail team set aside and the ones the email team forwarded to her. She had to choose the 10 the president would actually read. And no, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want help. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to read,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, bouncing a stack of pages up and down and into order. She was in her early 30s, unadorned, the kind of person who wore her professionalism earnestly: a well-practiced posture, a sensible maroon dress, sensible flats. You could imagine her becoming dean of a really hard liberal-arts college one day. She grew up in a house loud with conversation about the way government works \xe2\x80\x94 her father is the presidential historian Richard Reeves. She had wanted a career in publishing, not politics. She went to Duke, studied public policy and African and African-American studies, and then came Obama.'b'Curating the 10LADs was a job she regarded as sacrosanct. She thought of it as a daily conversation with the president, each package an array of voices she believed most accurately rendered America\xe2\x80\x99s mood: Here\xe2\x80\x99s what America is feeling, Mr. President. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes I think of it as a tray passing under a door,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'For Reeves, getting a couple hundred letters down to 20 was one kind of challenge, but the real work was getting to 10. She had to be ruthless. The two previous directors (both of whom lasted two years) used a linear system: subject folders. Give the president letters from energy, health care, immigration and so on. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then letters in each folder are sort of in competition with each other instead of with the broad group,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'I suppose the point was obvious, but it took me a moment to compute the implications. It had to do with fairness, and an underlying assumption that the letters represented people, not problems.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnyway, a disorderly pile is more honest,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Today\xe2\x80\x99s pile was down to 15. She read through them again, one then the next. Her fingers were long, and her nails were painted shiny red, and she held the pages gently, laying each one down slowly, as if she didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to hurt it. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, this one has to make it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd then this one, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to follow, but I think even the fact that it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to follow is part of the story. ... And then this, we\xe2\x80\x99re getting so many of these long-term legacy reflections, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know. ... \xe2\x80\x9d'b'She looked for stories. Not pro-this or con-that, not screeds, not opinions about what someone heard on N.P.R. The president needed to hear the stories \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s what he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get himself. \xe2\x80\x9cHe can\xe2\x80\x99t walk down a street and see what it normally looks like,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. She thought of the letters as a periscope outside the bubble, as a way for him to see as he used to see, before Secret Service protection and armored vehicles and a press pool and the world watching.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo we have one, two, three, four ... nine, 10, and then this one is 11 so we have to remove one.\xe2\x80\x9d She read, shook her head. \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., O.K., I guess.\xe2\x80\x9d She draped the discard on the far end of the couch. She looked over at it, then reached out to give it a little pat.'b'The finalists were now a pile on her lap, and she began shuffling them, pulling one out, putting it behind another, and another in front. I wondered about all the shuffling.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the order is critical,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. It was like putting a book of poems together, or a photo album. \xe2\x80\x9cThe order in which you see stories affects the way you perceive each one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe sometimes use the term \xe2\x80\x98sucker punch\xe2\x80\x99 in this office, which is brutal, but. ... \xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cBallsy\xe2\x80\x9d was the word one staff member used to describe Reeves. She could put three Dakota Access Pipeline pleas back to back. She could set the president up with a letter from someone gushing about the Affordable Care Act and then another from someone on the margin whose life was made worse because of it. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not: \xe2\x80\x98You failed,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more, \xe2\x80\x98Solutions don\xe2\x80\x99t solve things for everyone.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She grabbed a pencil. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes on Friday, particularly on Friday, we\xe2\x80\x99ll end with one that\xe2\x80\x99s like, \xe2\x80\x98Hey, I like the way you tie your tie.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d She called that a chaser. It could be a comment about the dog, or about riding his bike, or just, \xe2\x80\x9cHey, are you a pancakes or waffles man?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K., this is it,\xe2\x80\x9d Reeves announced, finally, gathering the pages on her lap, smoothing them like you would pet a cat.'b'She flipped over her pencil and went at the letters with her eraser, removing any and all codes. The president should definitely not see codes. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a letter takes a turn that is surprising in the text \xe2\x80\x94 say, on Page 3 something surprising happens in her life, but the way we\xe2\x80\x99ve assigned what category it falls into kind of spoils the surprise \xe2\x80\x94 then the writer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get to bring the president through her experience in the same way.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s why everybody had to use pencil.'b''b'I asked President 'b'Obama if he read the letters in the sequence in which Reeves gave them to him.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI actually do!\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'He said he liked to read the mail after dinner. He took the briefing book to the Treaty Room, did the work in the front first and saved the letters in the purple folder for last. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are occasions where the letter is particularly, uh, pointed at what an idiot I am,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'I asked him how he came up with the idea of reading 10 letters a day, and he thought awhile, then credited his chief of staff when he first got to the Senate. \xe2\x80\x9cPete Rouse,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Rouse had made it a point to set up a responsive correspondence office. \xe2\x80\x9cConstituents feel like you are hearing them, and that you are responding to them \xe2\x80\x94 that makes up for a lot of stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Obama remembers Rouse telling him. \xe2\x80\x9cThat kind of instilled in me the sense of \xe2\x80\x94 the power of mail. And people knowing that if they took the time to write something that the person who represented them was actually ... paying attention.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why I was surprised by how slowly the president talked. He seems so pensive on TV, but one on one, he is even more pensive, pulling out each word only after having examined it, like an old man putting together a jigsaw puzzle of some swirly seascape where there is blue, but then there is 'b'blue,'b' and then there is \xe2\x80\x9cblue,\xe2\x80\x9d and ... blue! It occurred to me that the letters gave him permission to legitimately slow down, an opportunity for nuance and contradiction. \xe2\x80\x9cI, maybe, didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand when I first started the practice how ... meaningful it would end up being to me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the time I got to the White House and somebody informed me that we were going to get 40,000-or-whatever-it-was pieces of mail a day,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to figure out how do I in some way duplicate that experience I had during the campaign. And I think this was the idea that struck me as realistic. Ten a day, I figured I could do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked him if there were letters that stuck with him, and he talked about the mail he got from wounded soldiers and veterans, particularly those who had PTSD. He thought back to other letters. He said the good ones weren\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily the dramatic ones.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe letters that matter the most to me are the ones that ... make a connection,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cSomebody just recently wrote me a letter about when they were growing up \xe2\x80\x94 their mom always used to use the N word and was derogatory about African-Americans, but was also an unbelievably great mom who worked three jobs to put the kids through school, and how ... sort of both troubling and proud \xe2\x80\x94 how troubling this woman saw her mother\xe2\x80\x99s prejudice, but how proud she was of her mom as a person. And how, toward the end of her life, her attitudes changed, and she ended up announcing she was going to vote for the black guy. She had now passed away, but she thought I should know that.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know, there are those kinds of letters, I think, that \xe2\x80\x94 shape your attitudes.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He volunteered stories of other letters: a woman in Minnesota writing about her monthly expenses, a dad writing to say that his son had befriended an illegal immigrant and that the experience had flipped his own bigotry on its head. He talked about a guy who wrote recently to say how joyful he was that the Obama administration was about to end. \xe2\x80\x9cI remember that one said, \xe2\x80\x98Pack up your bags because, thank goodness, we\xe2\x80\x99re about to undo everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done, it couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have come a moment too soon,\xe2\x80\x99 something along those lines. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I responded to that one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked him about the line between the person and the president when it came to reading the mail. I wondered if the letters had a way of breaking down the barrier. I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t even sure if that was a good thing, but maybe it was the unintended consequence of the 10LADs experiment.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you, one of the things I\xe2\x80\x99m proud of about having been in this office is that I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve ... lost myself,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. Like everything else, this thought was coming out slowly. But I suppose not losing yourself is a big thing to think about quickly.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel as if \xe2\x80\x94 even if my skin is thicker from, you know, public criticism,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\xe2\x80\x99m wiser about the workings of government, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t become ... cynical, and I haven\xe2\x80\x99t become callused. And I would like to think that these letters have something to do with that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I asked him how he might advise Donald Trump on what to do with the mail if he were to become president.'b'He laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know what, this is a great habit. But um, it, uh,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about the idea of a President Trump reading constituent mail. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it worked for me because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something I did for anyone else \xe2\x80\x94 I did it because it ... sustained me. So maybe it will sustain others in the future.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K.?\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cBack from the OVAL\xe2\x80\x9d'b' was what the stamp said on the letters Obama had read. They were returned in batches to O.P.C., and most had some kind of notation in the margins. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on here?\xe2\x80\x9d the president may have written, which meant he was requesting a follow-up memo from staff with some broader context \xe2\x80\x94 say, in response to a teenager dealing with a trend he didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand. He might say, \xe2\x80\x9cD.O.J., can we help?\xe2\x80\x9d which meant he wanted the staff to reach out to the Justice Department to look into the situation, like making sure an inmate is getting the medications he needs. Or he could simply say \xe2\x80\x9cReply,\xe2\x80\x9d and if he did that, he would offer notes in the margins for the writing team to use as guidelines for how to respond in his name.'b'Kolbie Blume was the person who translated those notes from the president. Her office was on the fifth floor of the Executive Office Building \xe2\x80\x94 where most of the elevators don\xe2\x80\x99t go; you had to take a back staircase. \xe2\x80\x9cEven people in the White House don\xe2\x80\x99t know this office exists,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. She had the clean, untouched look of an adolescent: a neat, short bob, a buttoned-up top with pearls. She was 23. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is my first job out of college,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI mean, it\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of pressure.\xe2\x80\x9d She grew up in Utah, saw Obama on TV when she was in high school and became one of the only Democrats in town.'b'Blume was working on a letter to a man who was angry about being profiled by the police in his community. She showed me some of Obama\xe2\x80\x99s handwritten comments in the margins. He had underlined sentences and added exclamation points; the words he wrote were sparse, but Blume understood the code. \xe2\x80\x9cSee?\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou can break down the sections of his thoughts: I\xe2\x80\x99m mad, too. My administration can\xe2\x80\x99t intervene. But this is what we are doing. No one should have to fear being profiled. And then he ends with, This is what you need to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She\xe2\x80\x99d been at this for two years, and by now she had it down. \xe2\x80\x9cIt took me awhile,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so easy to think linearly, like, O.K., here\xe2\x80\x99s a person who wrote about climate change, let\xe2\x80\x99s just plunk in some language about climate change here.\xe2\x80\x9d Reeves kept tossing those letters back to her, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d This was a 'b'person'b' she was writing to. And the president was a 'b'person.'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I vividly remember, almost like an epiphany,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like, one day I just got it.\xe2\x80\x9d Every letter coming from the president was ultimately a variation on the same theme, she realized. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s: \xe2\x80\x98Look, I hear you. You exist. I\xe2\x80\x99m listening, and your voice matters.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d There was something surprising about all of this, the idea of the president in the role of a nation\xe2\x80\x99s therapist.'b'I reached out to some of the people who sent letters to President Obama and asked them why they decided to write. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, I never thought he\xe2\x80\x99d read it,\xe2\x80\x9d was the most common refrain, followed by: \xe2\x80\x9cI was desperate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy mom, my brother and I were cleaning up the glass,\xe2\x80\x9d Ashley DeLeon, who is from Jacksonville, N.C., told me, relaying the story about the night in 2014 when she decided to write to the president. It was Christmas. \xe2\x80\x9cAll the remnants of the fish tank and everything that my father had shot up,\xe2\x80\x9d she was saying. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he shot the flag that was awarded to him when he retired and all of his medals and everything \xe2\x80\x94 all the memorabilia associated with the Marine Corps, he shot first. And that to me spoke more than anything. And so we cleaned up as much as we could, and then I went upstairs and I wrote the letter. And \xe2\x80\x94 yeah, I wrote it that night.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'DeLeon\xe2\x80\x99s letter ended up in a pile just like all the others in the O.P.C. hard-mail room. A staff member read it and wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cred dot.\xe2\x80\x9d He took it across the hall to Lacey Higley. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first time that I read something and I needed to take a walk,\xe2\x80\x9d he told her. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to make sure someone else sees this. We need to make sure this goes somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d Higley scanned the letter, forwarded the scan to the V.A.\xe2\x80\x99s crisis unit. Then she took the letter to Reeves. \xe2\x80\x9cThe president needs to see this,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. Reeves included DeLeon\xe2\x80\x99s letter in that day\xe2\x80\x99s 10LADs.'b'DeLeon\xe2\x80\x99s letter didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back in the next batch marked \xe2\x80\x9cBack from the OVAL.\xe2\x80\x9d It didn\xe2\x80\x99t come back in the batch after that either. Some letters the president stewed over. Some letters he answered in his own hand, on a white card marked, \xe2\x80\x9cThe White House.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ashley told me she was shocked when she got a letter back from the president. She said she was grateful. But that didn\xe2\x80\x99t mean she got her dad back. He later crashed his motorcycle into an S.U.V. \xe2\x80\x9cHe had two gallon-size freezer bags full of medication at the time that he died,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'Higley told me she kept DeLeon\xe2\x80\x99s letter hanging over her desk. It was the letter that helped shape in her a sense of purpose. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was one of those moments where you just kind of realize the importance of what you\xe2\x80\x99re doing,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt led me on a new path. Like, helping people and helping families like Ashley\xe2\x80\x99s is something I want to do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When people in the West Wing talked about \xe2\x80\x9cthe letter underground,\xe2\x80\x9d this is part of what they meant. This whole thing was just supposed to be about the president getting 10 letters a day, but the mail grew into something else; letters informed policy proposals and speeches \xe2\x80\x94 Obama referred to DeLeon\xe2\x80\x99s letter when he signed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act into law \xe2\x80\x94 and they affected people personally. Reeves was the chief driver of the letter underground. Why should the president be the only one reading 10LADs, she reasoned a few years ago. \xe2\x80\x9cI started spamming people,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. Constituent letters began popping into the inboxes of top aides and speechwriters and advisers. Why not? It caught on. Recently, Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to Obama, asked why she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t on the list for the 10LADs, so Reeves added her.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a big hustler of the mail,\xe2\x80\x9d Reeves said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy whole team, we are Kool-Aid drinkers for these letter writers.\xe2\x80\x9d And I suppose that was the surprising point. The Kool-Aid wasn\xe2\x80\x99t something Obama was serving. The Kool-Aid was the mail.'b'This was the message Reeves was preaching, and Blume was preaching, and this was the message you were bombarded with in the hard-mail room: Individual voices matter. Empathy was the name of the game. If that was the code of the mailroom, well, maybe it worked to sway the minds of lawmakers, and maybe it didn\xe2\x80\x99t, but there was a certain degree of sorrow attached to the thought that an experiment like that had to end.'b''b'It was raining 'b'on the morning after the election, and I arrived at the White House gates early. No one at the main O.P.C. office on the fourth floor was in yet except for Reeves, who was shuffling through papers while I sat on the other side of her desk. \xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, looking up. Her face held the vague puffiness of a morning after little sleep.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d she started again, raising her chin. She was having trouble making eye contact. The sky outside her window was a flat, steely gray. I could hear the distant whir of a printer revving up. There was a wet umbrella at my feet.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, your hair looks great,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cUm.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I told her no, her hair did. \xe2\x80\x9cOh, it\xe2\x80\x99s just. ... \xe2\x80\x9d She shook her head to make a swish. We discussed my bangs. Hair talk, even for someone as poised as Reeves, is a refuge.'b'Email was expected to fire in at an unprecedented rate the day after the election, and over in the email room, a staff member stood up to address the packed room of about 50 people \xe2\x80\x94 all hands on deck \xe2\x80\x94 who were becoming confused about what to do. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re seeing a lot of people in meltdown mode,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to the letter writers. He was a young, slightly pear-shaped guy with jet black hair. The first task, he told everyone, was to simply read. As a matter of routine, each email was coded according to the same scheme as the hard mail, with the prewritten policy-response letters ready to go. But that day staff members were forced to come up with new codes in order to categorize the flow: \xe2\x80\x9celection pro,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9celection con\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9clegacy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo \xe2\x80\x98election pro\xe2\x80\x99 is like, \xe2\x80\x98Donald Trump is the best, and this is a great day for America,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d he told the group. People leaned their heads away from the rows of screens to listen, and others looked up from laptops jammed into corners. There were tissues. People were crying. McMuffins had been brought in, along with doughnuts, juice, Power Bars.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then \xe2\x80\x98election con\xe2\x80\x99 is going to be like, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m scared,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d he went on. He was standing in the middle of the room, and you could tell he was not used to having to make his voice carry. \xe2\x80\x9cSo, like, \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do, I have a disability, I\xe2\x80\x99m in an L.G.B.T. family, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going on anymore.\xe2\x80\x99 That\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98election con.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen \xe2\x80\x98legacy\xe2\x80\x99 is gonna be, \xe2\x80\x98You know, I was really disappointed about last night, your family is amazing, I think you did great things\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 that\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98legacy.\xe2\x80\x99 Some of these things will be a little vague, and I know it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be hard, but feel free to ask questions as we\xe2\x80\x99re going through this, and let\xe2\x80\x99s try to make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re being as specific as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about people talking about election recounts and fraud and rigging?\xe2\x80\x9d one intern asked.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cElection fraud? Just close those out \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about people writing before the results were out?\xe2\x80\x9d another asked. \xe2\x80\x9cLike people writing in to say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m looking forward to President Clinton,\xe2\x80\x99 but it\xe2\x80\x99s clearly obvious that that\xe2\x80\x99s ... not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYeah. We can close those.

What, exactly, should Obama say to all these people?'b''b'At the end 'b'of the day, Reeves had to pick the 10LADs from the email that came flying in, and Kyle Herman, on the writing team, had to compose the response to America in meltdown mode.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI haven\xe2\x80\x99t gotten very far,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me in his office, sitting in front of a blank screen.'b'He had been up all night, at his parents\xe2\x80\x99 house in Ohio, where he\xe2\x80\x99d been knocking on doors to get out the vote, and then he flew back to work, and he had never expected to have to write a letter like this.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPersonally, the worst thing is that it feels like a rebuke of the connection we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to make between the president and the people,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cLike, if our responsibility in this office is to connect the president to the people, I\xe2\x80\x99m asking myself, \xe2\x80\x98Did we fail?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He looked at me, expecting something.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I don\xe2\x80\x99t understand it, because he\xe2\x80\x99s read more mail than any president in history, he seems more connected to the people than any president in history.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I felt compelled to remind him that Obama wasn\xe2\x80\x99t running for re-election. Clinton was the one who lost.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe bargaining stage of grief,\xe2\x80\x9d he mumbled.'b'I could hear Bae outside in the hall, laughing and joking with some other staff members; the discrepancy was palpable. Bae was the kind of person you would want at your mother\xe2\x80\x99s funeral. She told me she had tried to cheer Herman up. \xe2\x80\x9cI said, \xe2\x80\x98Kyle, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it so cool?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we have a real opportunity to home in on the president\xe2\x80\x99s message. But more than that, like, this is friggin\xe2\x80\x99 America. Which is like, what an opportunity. Like, what an honor. You know what I mean? Like, Woo! What an 'b'honor!'b' Like, what? I lived my life!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She told me that the team had handed over all the transition materials \xe2\x80\x94 pages and pages explaining O.P.C. procedures \xe2\x80\x94 to Trump\xe2\x80\x99s transition team. Reeves told them she would be available for in-person briefings. She wanted to explain everything, how they built the systems they built, and why.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s like, the Obama administration did all this to hear people\xe2\x80\x99s stories,\xe2\x80\x9d Bae said. \xe2\x80\x9cHow could they possibly not meet us and grow it further?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Like everyone else in O.P.C., Bae would be leaving once the new administration took over. That, of course, was always the plan. And the letters had set them on a new course. Bae was applying for graduate programs, where she considered studying kidnapping negotiations. Blume was looking for a Ph.D. program in children\xe2\x80\x99s literature. Higley will forge a career path in mental health and suicide prevention. Reeves said she wanted to focus on being married for a while.'b'I stopped by Reeves\xe2\x80\x99s office to see how she was coming with the 10LADs. She was already on the couch with the finalists on her lap. \xe2\x80\x9cI had some rice pudding,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, managing a smile. The emails had been printed, and she was flipping through the pages considering the sequence. \xe2\x80\x9cI think it will hit him like it hit us, a pile of voices that don\xe2\x80\x99t follow a tight narrative.\xe2\x80\x9d She spoke quietly as she sorted, mostly to herself. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople concerned for others,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, holding a few out. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople concerned for themselves,\xe2\x80\x9d she said about another group, and when she was finished she sat up straight.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K., so this is the first one,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, showing it to me. The writer was cheering Trump\xe2\x80\x99s victory. He recommended a fire into which Obama could put all of his executive orders and, together with the rest of the ruinous liberals, watch them burn.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an introduction, because it sort of feels like the day began,\xe2\x80\x9d Reeves said, and I could tell she had no interest in defending her choice.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then I like the personal nature of this one for the second,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, going through her choices with the satisfaction of an author reading her final draft. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s married to someone who voted different from her. But they will continue to be a family. Then this one is incredible. What a guy. Then behind him \xe2\x80\x94 this is someone who is in dire financial straits. I felt that was someone whose voice really matters right now.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'She gathered the letters. She checked her phone. She jiggled the lid on the glass water bottle that always accompanied her. \xe2\x80\x9cSo I\xe2\x80\x99m going to hand them off. And they\xe2\x80\x99ll get scanned and sent around.\xe2\x80\x9d On the whiteboard was the countdown: 72 days until the experiment ended, and the new administration decided how to handle the mail.'b''b''b''b''b''b'Your book, \xe2\x80\x9cLife\xe2\x80\x99s Work,\xe2\x80\x9d is rooted in the fact that you have a moral and spiritual argument in favor of abortion rights, and you talk about your shift from someone who, for religious reasons, didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to provide abortion to someone who, for religious reasons, did. Why did you consider that a \xe2\x80\x9cconversion\xe2\x80\x9d? 'b'I had to come to a crisis moment regarding a religious understanding that left me unable to help women when I felt deeply for their situation. So I needed to convert from a religious understanding that left me paralyzed to act on my deepest sense of connection to one that empowered me to do what I felt to be the right thing. It felt as life-altering for me to move from being unable to do abortions to being able to do them as it did to move from being a nonbeliever to becoming a believer.'b''b'You concede in the book that abortion is, actually, a life-ending process. 'b'Here\xe2\x80\x99s the thing: Life is a process, not an event. If I thought I was killing a person, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do abortions. A fetus is not a person; it\xe2\x80\x99s a human entity. In the moral scheme of things, I don\xe2\x80\x99t hold fetal life and the life of a woman equally. I value them both, but in the precedence of things, when a woman comes to me, I find myself unable to demote her aspirations because of the aspirations that someone else has for the fetus that she\xe2\x80\x99s carrying.'b''b'You talk about \xe2\x80\x9cverbicaine\xe2\x80\x9d during procedures, or conversations with patients in which you try to lighten the mood, even despite the narrative that makes abortion seem morbid and tragic. 'b'Rather than allowing your fear to amplify any sensation that you\xe2\x80\x99re having, you\xe2\x80\x99re having a conversation with me, you\xe2\x80\x99re asking yourself, Why isn\xe2\x80\x99t this guy treating me with judgment and stigma like I expected him to? When I say I\xe2\x80\x99m done and you were expecting something else, you\xe2\x80\x99re now asking me, Are you sure you\xe2\x80\x99re done? It\xe2\x80\x99s over. That\xe2\x80\x99s verbicaine.'b''b'Along those lines, sometimes you talk about University of Alabama football. 'b'I think Coach Nick Saban would understand that I\xe2\x80\x99m clued in to something he understands: that in Alabama, football is larger than life.'b''b'Why do you think that elite white women and the sacralization of motherhood has done some of the most serious damage to abortion access? 'b'When women acquiesce to a role determined primarily by their biology of reproduction \xe2\x80\x94 even if it\xe2\x80\x99s unconsciously \xe2\x80\x94 they judge each other for rejecting that primary identity. So if you think that the most essential role for a woman is to procreate, and humanity doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go on unless you do that, then anything to interrupt that process is to be counterintuitive or immoral. The biggest insult is the notion that there\xe2\x80\x99s such a thing as a black genocide, as if the people who care about abortion really care about black women and black babies.'b''b'Tell me about the connection between your heritage as a descendant of slaves and the idea that abortion is ultimately about ownership of a body. 'b'People often struggle with why, as a man, I am deeply committed to feminism, reproductive justice and gender equality. I come from a heritage of people who know what it\xe2\x80\x99s like to have your life controlled by somebody else. What\xe2\x80\x99s most proximate to that reality right now is the direct control of women\xe2\x80\x99s bodies and their reproduction, because if you don\xe2\x80\x99t control your reproduction, you don\xe2\x80\x99t control anything else about your life.'b''b'I can\xe2\x80\x99t help mentioning that you\xe2\x80\x99re not married, which you say is part of the reason you can do what you do. Is that a choice on your part? Because you seem pretty cool! 'b'I jokingly call myself the best-kept secret in Alabama. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t consciously choose not to be partnered or not to have kids \xe2\x80\x94 some things in life should declare themselves. But I try to be of the quality of somebody that I would like to meet. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had some good people in my life; I just haven\xe2\x80\x99t crossed that threshold. But if you know any takers, give me a call.'b''b''b''b''b''b'The village is'b' poor, even by the standards of rural Kenya. To get there, you follow a power line along a series of unmarked roads. Eventually, that power line connects to the school at the center of town, the sole building with electricity. Homesteads fan out into the hilly bramble, connected by rugged paths. There is just one working water tap, requiring many local women to gather water from a pit in jerrycans. There is no plumbing, and some families still practice open defecation, lacking the resources to dig a latrine. There aren\xe2\x80\x99t even oxen strong enough to pull a plow, meaning that most farming is still done by hand. The village is poor enough that it is considered rude to eat in public, which is seen as boasting that you have food.'b'In October, I visited Kennedy Aswan Abagi, the village chief, at his small red-earth home, decorated with posters celebrating the death of Osama bin Laden and the lives of African heroes, including JaKogelo, or \xe2\x80\x9cthe man from Kogelo,\xe2\x80\x9d as locals refer to former President Barack Obama. Kogelo, where Obama\xe2\x80\x99s father was born, is just 20 miles from the village, which lies close to the banks of Lake Victoria. Abagi told me about the day his town\xe2\x80\x99s fate changed. It happened during the summer, when field officers from an American nonprofit called GiveDirectly paid a visit, making an unbelievable promise: They wanted to give everyone money, no strings attached. \xe2\x80\x9cI asked, \xe2\x80\x98Why this village?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d Abagi recalled, but he never got a clear answer, or one that made much sense to him.'b'The villagers had seen Western aid groups come through before, sure, but nearly all of them brought stuff, not money. And because many of these organizations were religious, their gifts came with moral impositions; I was told that one declined to help a young mother whose child was born out of wedlock, for example. With little sense of who would get what and how and from whom and why, rumors blossomed. One villager heard that GiveDirectly would kidnap children. Some thought that the organization was aligned with the Illuminati, or that it would blight the village with giant snakes, or that it performed blood magic. Others heard that the money was coming from Obama himself.'b'But the confusion faded that unseasonably cool morning in October, when a GiveDirectly team returned to explain themselves during a town meeting. Nearly all of the village\xe2\x80\x99s 220 people crowded into a blue-and-white tent placed near the school building, watching nervously as 13 strangers, a few of them white, sat on plastic chairs opposite them. Lydia Tala, a Kenyan GiveDirectly staff member, got up to address the group in Dholuo. She spoke at a deliberate pace, awaiting a hum and a nod from the crowd before she moved on: These visitors are from GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a nongovernmental organization that is not affiliated with any political party. GiveDirectly is based in the United States. GiveDirectly works with mobile phones. Each person must have his or her own mobile phone, and they must keep their PIN secret. Nobody must involve themselves in criminal activity or terrorism. This went on for nearly two hours. The children were growing restless.'b'Finally, Tala passed the microphone to her colleague, Brian Ouma. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople of the village,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9care you happy?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried in unison.'b'Then he laid out the particulars. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery registered person will receive 2,280 shillings\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 about $22 \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9ceach and every month. You hear me?\xe2\x80\x9d The audience gasped and burst into wild applause. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery person we register here will receive the money, I said \xe2\x80\x94 2,280 shillings! Every month. This money, you will get for the next 12 years. How many years?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve years!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just like that, with peals of ululation and children breaking into dance in front of the strangers, the whole village was lifted out of extreme poverty. (I have agreed to withhold its name out of concern for the villagers\xe2\x80\x99 safety.) The nonprofit is in the process of registering roughly 40 more villages with a total of 6,000 adult residents, giving those people a guaranteed, 12-year-long, poverty-ending income. An additional 80 villages, with 11,500 residents all together, will receive a two-year basic income. With this initiative, GiveDirectly \xe2\x80\x94 with an office in New York and funded in no small part by Silicon Valley \xe2\x80\x94 is starting the world\xe2\x80\x99s first true test of a universal basic income. The idea is perhaps most in vogue in chilly, left-leaning places, among them Canada, Finland, the Netherlands and Scotland. But many economists think it might have the most promise in places with poorer populations, like India and sub-Saharan Africa.'b'GiveDirectly wants to show the world that a basic income is a cheap, scalable way to aid the poorest people on the planet. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the resources to eliminate extreme poverty this year,\xe2\x80\x9d Michael Faye, a founder of GiveDirectly, told me. But these resources are often misallocated or wasted. His nonprofit wants to upend incumbent charities, offering major donors a platform to push money to the world\xe2\x80\x99s neediest immediately and practically without cost.'b'What happens in this village has the potential to transform foreign-aid institutions, but its effects might also be felt closer to home. A growing crowd, including many of GiveDirectly\xe2\x80\x99s backers in Silicon Valley, are looking at this pilot project not just as a means of charity but also as the groundwork for an argument that a universal basic income might be right for you, me and everyone else around the world too.'b''b'The basic or 'b'guaranteed income is a curious piece of intellectual flotsam that has washed ashore several times in the past half-millennium, often during periods of great economic upheaval. In \xe2\x80\x9cUtopia,\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1516, Thomas More suggests it as a way to help feudal farmers hurt by the conversion of common land for public use into private land for commercial use. In \xe2\x80\x9cAgrarian Justice,\xe2\x80\x9d published in 1797, Thomas Paine supports it for similar reasons, as compensation for the \xe2\x80\x9closs of his or her natural inheritance, by the introduction of the system of landed property.\xe2\x80\x9d It reappears in the writings of French radicals, of Bertrand Russell, of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'b'Silicon Valley has recently become obsessed with basic income for reasons simultaneously generous and self-interested, as a palliative for the societal turbulence its inventions might unleash. Many technologists believe we are living at the precipice of an artificial-intelligence revolution that could vault humanity into a postwork future. In the past few years, artificially intelligent systems have become proficient at a startling number of tasks, from reading cancer scans to piloting a car to summarizing a sports game to translating prose. Any job that can be broken down into discrete, repeatable tasks \xe2\x80\x94 financial analytics, marketing, legal work \xe2\x80\x94 could be automated out of existence.'b'In this vision of the future, our economy could turn into a funhouse-mirror version of itself: extreme income and wealth inequality, rising poverty, mass unemployment, a shrinking prime-age labor force. It would be more George Saunders than George Jetson. But what does this all have to do with a small village in Kenya?'b'A universal basic income has thus far lacked what tech folks might call a proof of concept. There have been a handful of experiments, including ones in Canada, India and Namibia. Finland is sending money to unemployed people, and the Dutch city Utrecht is doing a trial run, too. But no experiment has been truly complete, studying what happens when you give a whole community money for an extended period of time \xe2\x80\x94 when nobody has to worry where his or her next meal is coming from or fear the loss of a job or the birth of a child.'b'And so, the tech industry is getting behind GiveDirectly and other organizations testing the idea out. Chris Hughes, a Facebook founder and briefly the owner of The New Republic, has started a $10 million, two-year initiative to explore the viability of a basic income. (He has also been a major donor to GiveDirectly.) The research wing of Sam Altman\xe2\x80\x99s start-up incubator, Y Combinator, is planning to pass out money to 1,000 families in California and another yet-to-be-determined state. Then there is GiveDirectly itself, which has attracted $24 million in donations for its basic-income effort, including money from founders of Facebook, Instagram, eBay and a number of other Silicon Valley companies. Many donors I spoke with cited their interest in the project as purely philanthropic. But others saw it as a chance to learn more about a universal basic income, a way to prove that it could work and a chance to show people the human face of a hypothetical policy fix.'b'In December, Altman, the 31-year-old president of Y Combinator, spoke at an anti-poverty event hosted by Stanford, the White House and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, the charitable institution the Facebook billionaire founded with his wife, Priscilla. Altman discussed the potential for basic income to alleviate poverty, but his speech veered back to the dark questions that hang over all this philanthropy: Is Silicon Valley about to put the world out of work? And if so, do technologists owe the world a solution?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere have been these moments where we have had these major technology revolutions \xe2\x80\x94 the Agricultural Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, for example \xe2\x80\x94 that have really changed the world in a big way,\xe2\x80\x9d Altman said. \xe2\x80\x9cI think we\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle or at least on the cusp of another one.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'GiveDirectly may be'b' a charity, but it speaks in the argot of Silicon Valley. It is a platform, connecting donors and recipients, that prides itself on low overhead and superior analytics. It disdains what it sees as the bloated, expensive, stuck-in-their-ways incumbents that dominate the nonprofit space. And it even has a privileged bootstrapping creation story, beginning with its 20-something founders batting the idea around in Harvard Square academic buildings and scraping together money from friends.'b'The idea for the nonprofit came to Michael Faye and Paul Niehaus, who is now a professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, when they were graduate students at Harvard. Both were studying development and doing fieldwork overseas, an experience that underlined an Economics 101 lesson: Cash was more valuable to its recipients than the in-kind gifts commonly distributed by aid groups, like food or bed nets or sports equipment. If you\xe2\x80\x99re hungry, you cannot eat a bed net. If your village is suffering from endemic diarrhea, soccer balls won\xe2\x80\x99t be worth much to you. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve been there, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine doing anything but cash,\xe2\x80\x9d Faye told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so deeply uncomfortable to ask someone if they want cash or something else. They look at you like it\xe2\x80\x99s a trick question.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But at the time, distributing cash aid in a country with little to no banking infrastructure outside major cities would have required an extraordinary amount of manpower, not to mention introducing the risk of robbery and graft. But dirt-cheap mobile phones with pay-as-you-go minutes began flooding into sub-Saharan African markets in the 2000s. Enterprising Ghanaians, Kenyans and Nigerians started to use their minutes as a kind of currency. In 2007, Vodafone and the British Department for International Development together built a system, called M-Pesa, for Kenyans to transfer actual shillings from cellphone to cellphone. An estimated 96 percent of Kenyan households use the system today.'b'Faye and Niehaus \xe2\x80\x94 along with their friends Rohit Wanchoo and Jeremy Shapiro, also graduate students \xe2\x80\x94 thought about setting up a website to raise cash in the United States and send it directly to poor Kenyans. But they never found a nonprofit that would distribute that cash abroad. They decided to do it themselves in 2008. \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it was a start-up, and we started in grad school,\xe2\x80\x9d Faye said, \xe2\x80\x9cwe were open to the idea of it being wrong or failing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The following year, Faye traveled to small Kenyan villages during the summer break, offering cash to whoever seemed poor and would take it. (The money, about $5,000, came out of the foursome\xe2\x80\x99s own pockets.) That, surprisingly, worked well enough to give them the confidence to start a threadbare randomized control trial the year they graduated. It found that the recipients, who received an average of $500, saw excellent outcomes: Their children were 42 percent less likely to go a whole day without eating. Domestic-violence rates dropped, and mental health improved.'b'In time, the nonprofit attracted the attention of Silicon Valley and its deep-pocketed young philanthropists. Two Facebook founders gave six-figure donations. Then, in the spring of 2012, Faye went to a friend\xe2\x80\x99s brunch in Brooklyn and met someone working for Google.org, the tech giant\xe2\x80\x99s giving arm. She liked the sound of GiveDirectly and arranged for Faye and Niehaus to give a presentation at Google\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. The company ended up contributing $2.4 million.'b'At first, GiveDirectly handed out large lump sums, generally $1,000 spread into three payments over the course of the year. The nonprofit\xe2\x80\x99s field officers would locate low-income villages in Kenya, then find the poorest families in each individual village using a simple asset test (whether a family had a thatched roof or not). The field officers would introduce themselves to the town elders, explain their purpose and return to provide mobile phones and training to recipient families. Then GiveDirectly would push a button and send the money out.'b''b'On a steaming'b' October morning, I went with two GiveDirectly executives, Joanna Macrae and Ian Bassin, to visit one of the villages that had received GiveDirectly\xe2\x80\x99s lump-sum payments. We took off at dawn from Kisumu, a bustling industrial city on the banks of Lake Victoria, and followed a two-lane highway to Bondo, a small trading city filled with cattle, bicycles and roadside food stands. From there, we turned inland from the lake and drove into a lush agricultural region.'b'The residents of this village had received money in 2013, and it was visibly better off than the basic-income pilot village. Its clearings were filled with mango plantings, its cows sturdy. A small lake on the outskirts had been lined with nets for catching fish. \xe2\x80\x9cCould you imagine sitting in an office in London or New York trying to figure out what this village needs?\xe2\x80\x9d Bassin said as he admired a well-fed cow tied up by the lakeside. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would just be impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps, but delivering money by M-Pesa has some downsides, too. We visited an older woman named Anjelina Akoth Ngalo, her joints painful and swollen with advanced malaria. Sitting in her thatched-roof hut, she told us that she had received only one payment, not the three that she was promised. She had given her phone to a woman in a nearby village who transferred the money out of it. Ngalo visited the village elder to try to get her money back, but nothing had come of it. She was now destitute, living on about $5 a week. She had not eaten since the day before, and she had run out of malaria medication. (Bassin said that less than 1 percent of recipients experience theft, crime or conflict.)'b'By giving money to some but not all, the organization had unwittingly strained the social fabric of some of these tight-knit tribal communities. One man we visited in a separate village nearby, Nicolus Owuor Otin, had acted as a liaison between the community and the GiveDirectly staff, showing them where different families\xe2\x80\x99 houses were, for instance. For that reason, he said, the other villagers thought he was determining who would get what and threatened to burn his house down.'b'Still, nearly all the recipients described the money as transformative. Fredrick Omondi Auma \xe2\x80\x94 a Burning Spear devotee wearing a Rasta-style hat and bell bottoms when we visited \xe2\x80\x94 had been impoverished, drinking too much, abandoned by his wife and living in a mud hut when GiveDirectly knocked on his door. He used his money to buy a motorbike to give taxi rides. He also started a small business, selling soap, salt and paraffin in a local town center; he bought two cows, one of which had given birth; and he opened a barbershop in the coastal city Mombasa. His income had gone from 600 shillings a week to 2,500 shillings \xe2\x80\x94 roughly $25, a princely sum for the area. His wife had returned. He had even stopped drinking as much. \xe2\x80\x9cI used to go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I\xe2\x80\x99d wake up in the bar with 100 shillings,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cNow I go out drinking with 1,000 shillings, and I wake up at home with 900.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I would be living in an iron-sheet house,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, referring to his roof. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I\xe2\x80\x99d be wearing nice shoes. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I would have a business, and earnings from it. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine I would be a man who owns cattle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Many popular forms'b' of aid have been shown to work abysmally. PlayPumps \xe2\x80\x94 merry-go-round-type contraptions that let children pump water from underground wells as they play \xe2\x80\x94 did little to improve access to clean water. Buy-a-cow programs have saddled families with animals inappropriate to their environment. Skills training and microfinance, one 2015 World Bank study found, \xe2\x80\x9chave shown little impact on poverty or stability, especially relative to program cost.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'All across the villages of western Kenya, it was clear to me just how much aid money was wasted on unnecessary stuff. The villagers had too many jerrycans and water tanks, because a nongovernmental organization kept bringing them. There was a thriving trade in Toms canvas slip-ons: People received them free from NGO workers and then turned around and sold them in the market centers. And none of the aid groups that had visited the villages managed to help the very poorest families.'b'In the pilot-project village, for example, Faye and I paid a visit to a woman named Caroline Akinyi Odhiambo, who lives in a mud hut on the edge of town with her husband, Jack, a laborer, and her two small children. The most expensive thing she ever bought, she told me, was a chicken for 500 shillings, or about $5. Her family was persistently hungry. She knew of three nonprofit groups that had helped the village before GiveDirectly. One aided families with school fees, but it chose not to help her children. \xe2\x80\x9cI do not want to talk about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she said.'b'What is worse, Faye told me, walking away from Odhiambo\xe2\x80\x99s hut, was that most nonprofit projects in the region were never subject to anything like an impact assessment, either. There is no way to know how well they are working, or whether that money would be better spent on something else. \xe2\x80\x9cThe question should always be: Would we be better off just giving this money away as cash?\xe2\x80\x9d Faye said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere usually is not a way to answer that question.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A vast majority of aid \xe2\x80\x94 94 percent \xe2\x80\x94 is noncash. Donor resistance is one reason for this; it is not easy to persuade American oligarchs, British inheritors and Japanese industrialists to fork over their money to the extremely poor to use as they see fit. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s the usual worries about welfare dependency, the whole \xe2\x80\x98Give a man a fish\xe2\x80\x99 thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Amanda Glassman, a public health and development expert at the Center for Global Development. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so powerful. It\xe2\x80\x99s really a basic psychological feature of the landscape. You\xe2\x80\x99ll start drinking. You\xe2\x80\x99ll start lying around at home because you\xe2\x80\x99re getting paid.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Cash also seems harder to market. American taxpayers might be perfectly happy to fund education for young women in poor countries or vaccinations for schoolchildren. But they might balk at the idea of showering money on poor, unstable countries. \xe2\x80\x9cThe visual of putting a pill in a kid\xe2\x80\x99s mouth is so much more attractive to people,\xe2\x80\x9d Glassman said.'b'Institutional inertia is another factor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of good people working in the system,\xe2\x80\x9d Niehaus said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd there are a lot of organizations pushing to do cash transfers. But the way they are structured and incentivized from the top down \xe2\x80\x94 they aren\xe2\x80\x99t structured to do it. They have a specific mandate, like health. Cash transfers give choice of what goal to pursue to the recipients.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Moreover, cash might force aid workers and nongovernmental organizations to confront the fact that they could be doing better by doing things differently \xe2\x80\x94 often by doing less. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easy to muster evidence that you should be giving cash instead of fertilizer,\xe2\x80\x9d said Justin Sandefur of the Center for Global Development. \xe2\x80\x9cThe harder argument is: You should shut down your U.S.A.I.D. program, which is bigger than the education budget of Liberia, and give the money to Liberians. That\xe2\x80\x99s the radical critique.\xe2\x80\x9d Faye put it more bluntly, if half-jokingly: If cash transfers flourished, \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole aid industry would have to fire itself.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There is something to that. One estimate, generated by Laurence Chandy and Brina Seidel of the Brookings Institution, recently calculated that the global poverty gap \xe2\x80\x94 meaning how much it would take to get everyone above the poverty line \xe2\x80\x94 was just $66 billion. That is roughly what Americans spend on lottery tickets every year, and it is about half of what the world spends on foreign aid.'b''b'In the pilot-project 'b'village, the residents had just started to work through how transformative the program would be, what they could do with the money and how different their lives could feel in 12 years. Detractors often say that no one would work in a world with a basic income, that the safety net could grow a bit too comfortable. Ultimately, what a universal income would do to workers in the rich world will remain a mystery until someone tries it out.'b'But here, many villagers were concerned primarily with procuring the sustenance and basic comforts that their penury had denied them. Odhiambo, the woman who had not been offered aid by the school group, planned to buy corrugated iron sheets for her roof; she considered possibly paying off her dowry. Another villager, Pamela Aooko Odero, ran a household that had been suffering from hunger, with all eight of them living on just 500 to 1,000 shillings a week. She took her money as soon as she got it and went to buy food.'b'Many more made plans that were entrepreneurial. Two widowed sister-wives, Margaret Aloma Abagi and Mary Abonyo Abagi, told me they planned to pool their funds together to start a small bank with some friends. Charles Omari Ager, a houseboy for the sister-wives, had his phone turned off and wrapped in a plastic bag in his pocket when the first text came in. He was driving the widows\xe2\x80\x99 goats and cattle from one dried-out, bramble-filled meadow to another when he happened upon an aid worker, who prompted him to pull out his phone, turn it on and wait. The text was there. The money was there. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m happy! I\xe2\x80\x99m happy! I\xe2\x80\x99m happy!\xe2\x80\x9d he said. He bought himself a goat that day.'b'When he got his money, Erick Odhiambo Madoho walked to the cow-dotted local highway nearest the village and took a 'b'matatu'b', a shared minibus, overloaded with 20 passengers, down to Lake Victoria. There he found an M-Pesa stand and converted his mobile money into shillings. He used the cash to buy the first of three rounds of filament-thin fishing line that he would need to hand-knot into nets to catch tilapia in the lake.'b'When the nets were done, he told me, he would rent a boat and hire a day laborer to work with him. He anticipated that his income, after costs, might reach as much as 2,000 shillings on a good day. I asked him why he hadn\xe2\x80\x99t saved money for nets beforehand.'b'He shrugged, smiled and said, \xe2\x80\x9cI could not.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''b'The growing season never ends here in Los Angeles. Even in the depths of winter, I can read about, obsess over, order and plant new seeds all within a matter of weeks. Because that\xe2\x80\x99s when the seed catalogs arrive, stuffed into mailboxes around the solstice, hitting like a blast of warm air: lists of many hundreds of different fruits, vegetables and flowers. As the lengthening days start tipping toward spring, I pore over these catalogs, reading them cover to cover: There are multihued carrots and beets, cucumbers shaded yellow, orange and rust red; there\xe2\x80\x99s lettuce that\xe2\x80\x99s harvested, curiously, for its stems, and rutabagas that grow to be the size of small children. It is the closest I get in my adult life to the feeling of reading the Sharper Image catalog as a 10-year-old.'b'On one hand, seed catalogs are vessels for the sort of dry and practical information gardeners and farmers need \xe2\x80\x94 U.S.D.A. plant-hardiness-zone numbers, days to maturity, yield and crop size. But smuggled inside these booklets, along with the awkward photos of farmers posing next to comically large crops, are tiny narratives that manage to encompass nearly the entirety of human history and the vast complexity of American identity.'b'You can read about \xe2\x80\x94 and buy seeds for \xe2\x80\x94 the crops Thomas Jefferson farmed at Monticello. You choose among beans that have been cultivated in North America since before Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic and others, like those carried by Cherokee Indians along the Trail of Tears, colored by the horrors that followed his arrival. There are seeds for Origanum syriacum, a relative of oregano mentioned in the Bible, which grows wild across the rocky hills of Israel and Palestine and is used in the spice blend za\xe2\x80\x99atar that seasons cuisine throughout the Middle East.'b'Many of these vegetables have managed to persist for centuries, only to become nearly obsolete \xe2\x80\x94 if not lost altogether \xe2\x80\x94 thanks to matters of both technology and taste. With a globalized food chain, there\xe2\x80\x99s less of a need for tomatoes that can be picked in August and stored well into winter. We prefer candy-sweet corn to the older varieties, which get starchier by the hour after the ears come off the stalk.'b'Heirloom vegetables may have recently come back in vogue, but seed companies have played an important role in preserving them, selling them by mail for decades. Of course, calling a vegetable an heirloom is akin to calling a band \xe2\x80\x9cindie\xe2\x80\x9d: It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean anything in particular, and while it alludes to a certain aesthetic or feeling, the designation is hardly a guarantee of quality. Generally speaking, heirlooms are both open-pollinated (meaning they can be regrown from saved seeds) and old, although there\xe2\x80\x99s no real consensus on how old. Many put the line around the middle of the 20th century.'b'If the notion of what an heirloom vegetable is remains vague in the general sense, seed catalogs are proof of how wondrous it can be in the specific. Consider a pink tomato called Aunt Lou\xe2\x80\x99s Underground Railroad, which is said to have been carried by a slave, his name lost to history, who won his freedom as he escaped out of Kentucky and into Ripley, Ohio. It was impossible to know what kind of life he would find on the other side of the Mason-Dixon, but he knew he was going to plant a garden there. And in 1887, under very different circumstances, Giuseppe and Angella Nardiello left their village in southern Italy for Connecticut. They took with them, among other things, seeds for the sweet red peppers they grew every year. Today I can order seeds for Jimmy Nardello peppers, named for the couple\xe2\x80\x99s fourth son; they\xe2\x80\x99re a farmers\xe2\x80\x99-market favorite in California.'b'Even if you never produce a bumper crop of anything but kale, as is often the case in my yard, the habit of gardening, and the routines and rhythms it enforces in life, are part of the reason to keep at it year after year. If I want to have tomatoes in July, I need to get seedlings in the ground by the beginning of April. I know there\xe2\x80\x99s a good chance they\xe2\x80\x99ll end up entombed in a fine web spun by spider mites come summer, but spring\xe2\x80\x99s optimism always makes it feel as if this might be the year that I finally get the upper hand \xe2\x80\x94 especially when I\xe2\x80\x99m flipping through a seed catalog. After all, these are crops that have provided for people around the globe for centuries, humanity and the seeds themselves propagating in tandem.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s raining this winter, but Los Angeles is technically still in a drought. So when I\xe2\x80\x99m not reading my seed catalogs for the articles, so to speak, I comb the pages for plants tolerant of aridity and heat. Luckily, those conditions appeal to many varieties from the Southwest and northern Mexico. The region is home to plants that put World War II-era heirlooms to shame: indigenous corn and bean varieties that have been farmed without irrigation in the dry heat of places like Arizona and New Mexico for more than 4,000 years.'b'But for now, the deluge. On Inauguration Day, it rained nearly two inches in Los Angeles \xe2\x80\x94 the second day in a series of storms that drenched Southern California with about a third as much rain as fell during all of last winter. For the White Mountain cabbage collards, the heads swelling with layer after layer of new leaves, for the fava beans that are inching toward flowering, nothing else of consequence happened. And with a bit of care and a bit more rain, they will soon be ready to harvest, regardless of what happens to the world in the meantime.'b''b''b''b''b''b'W'b'hen I first met Yang Jinkai, two days before he boarded a plane for America, the smog hanging over his industrial home city, Shenyang, had turned the sun into a ghostly orb. The 16-year-old paced around the family apartment as his mother labeled his suitcases and packed them with the comforts of home: quilted pajamas, chopsticks, instant noodles. She gestured toward a lone memento that would remain in his bedroom, a life-size needlepoint portrait of her only child, woven in shimmering gold thread. \xe2\x80\x9cI worked on that all year,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI knew this moment would come.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Yang had never traveled outside China. But he had already chosen a new first name for his life in America, Korbin (\xe2\x80\x9cThat sounds American, right?\xe2\x80\x9d), and was daydreaming about the adventure ahead. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be magical,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll make lots of American friends. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have an American girlfriend. Maybe\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he shot a glance at his father \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll even get a gun.\xe2\x80\x9d Over the summer, Korbin had been working on his English by watching, perhaps too zealously, the American television series \xe2\x80\x9cCriminal Minds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To help Korbin escape the competitive straitjacket of the Chinese education system, his father had paid nearly $40,000 to an education consultancy to get him enrolled in a public high school in Michigan. The Yang family\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate goal was for Korbin to attend a top American university, and the name of his new high school, Oxford, only added to the allure. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t matter that the place had no connection to the British university or that this Oxford was a small town north of Detroit. \xe2\x80\x9cMy father,\xe2\x80\x9d Korbin said, \xe2\x80\x9creally likes the idea of an Oxford diploma.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Even as U.S.-China relations have slipped toward mutual antagonism, the flood of Chinese students coming to the United States has continued to rise. Roughly 370,000 students from the mainland are enrolled in American high schools and universities, six times more than a decade ago. Their financial impact \xe2\x80\x94 $11.4 billion was contributed to the American economy in 2015, according to the Department of Commerce \xe2\x80\x94 has turned education into one of America\xe2\x80\x99s top \xe2\x80\x9cexports\xe2\x80\x9d to China.'b'It is a strange historical moment when the elites of a rising power send their only sons and daughters, products of China\xe2\x80\x99s former one-child policy, to the schools of a geopolitical rival. Yet the idea of a liberal Western education exerts an almost talismanic hold over China\xe2\x80\x99s ruling classes. While the country\xe2\x80\x99s educational emphasis on rote memorization churns out some of the world\xe2\x80\x99s best test-takers, many Chinese families harbor worries that diverge sharply from those of the tiger parents of popular conception. They fret about the toll competition exacts from their coddled offspring; they wonder if their child\xe2\x80\x99s creativity is being stifled. Even President Xi Jinping, who is presiding over a crackdown on Western influences in China\xe2\x80\x99s schools, allowed his daughter to attend Harvard. According to a 2016 survey conducted by a Shanghai-based research firm, 83 percent of China\xe2\x80\x99s millionaires are planning to send their children to school abroad. The average age, according to the poll, has dropped to 16 today from 18 in 2014 \xe2\x80\x94 the first time it has reached the high-school level.'b'In 2005, only 641 Chinese students were enrolled in American high schools. By 2014, that student population approached 40,000 \xe2\x80\x94 a 60-fold increase in a single decade \xe2\x80\x94 and it now accounts for nearly half of all international high-school students in the United States. \xe2\x80\x9cParents realize that they have to start earlier if they want their children to get into a top U.S. university,\xe2\x80\x9d says Nini Suet, founder of Shang Learning, a boutique consultancy with headquarters in Beijing that charges $25,000 to $40,000 to help Chinese kids prepare for and apply to American boarding schools. \xe2\x80\x9cFamilies are looking for any edge they can get.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As a new administration vowing \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica First\xe2\x80\x9d settles into the White House, there is uncertainty about how long this phenomenon can last. It already faces headwinds within China. A slowing economy has cut into family savings, and a depreciating currency makes American educations more expensive. There are also fewer Chinese students to go around: The population of 18-to-23-year-olds has dropped by nearly a quarter in the last decade.'b'But the exodus of Chinese students continues for now, driven not just by a push from China but also by a pull from the United States. For each rich Chinese kid who enters an American school \xe2\x80\x94 whether public or private, college or high school \xe2\x80\x94 the multiplier effect means that entire communities can be buoyed by the buying power of the world\xe2\x80\x99s second-largest economy.'b'That\xe2\x80\x99s the hope, at least. The reality is more complicated. Much of the money spent by Chinese families desperate for American diplomas ends up with the intermediary companies that connect them with cash-hungry schools. These matches have yielded unusual results. According to an article in Foreign Policy magazine, nearly 60 percent of the high-school students end up in religious schools, despite coming from the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest atheist state. (Their parents welcome the messages of safety, discipline and moral values that emanate from these faith-based institutions.) Another cohort winds up in what are effectively diploma mills, which confer visas and credentials but little adult supervision.'b'Public high schools are the newest frontier: Less than 5 percent of all Chinese \xe2\x80\x9cparachute kids\xe2\x80\x9d (as they\xe2\x80\x99ve come to be called) are currently in public schools, but certain U.S. school districts have begun to rely on them to offset budget cuts and increase cultural diversity at the same time as private academies are reaching saturation points.'b'Few public school districts have deeper ties to China than Oxford, Mich., outside Detroit. In 2010, the town sought to create the first pipeline of Chinese students into a public high school, one that embodied its high school\xe2\x80\x99s motto \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cwhere the globe is our classroom\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 even as it brought tuition money to the school. As the number of foreign students grew, other Midwestern schools sought to emulate Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s success. But when a Beijing education company proposed building a multimillion-dollar dormitory for Chinese students on the Oxford campus, a community battle ensued.'b'Chance put Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s family at the starting point of Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s experiment, in Shenyang. His parents grew up without proper educations in rural villages haunted by the memories of famine. His father, Yang Huaiguo, migrated to Shenyang and scavenged for scrap metal before finding success in the boiler-repair business and real estate. But he worried about Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s education and the almost unrelenting pressure to study for the two exams that determine a Chinese student\xe2\x80\x99s future: the high-school entrance exam, the 'b'zhongkao'b', and the university-entrance exam, the 'b'gaokao'b'. There seemed to be no way out, until Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s school opened an international wing in partnership with Oxford. The pitch was enticing: After spending 10th grade in the program, Korbin was guaranteed a place at Oxford High School for two years, until graduation.'b'His father insisted that this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just about family prestige or future job prospects. \xe2\x80\x9cI also want my son to understand, in a way that I never could,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the world is bigger than Shenyang, bigger than China.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'On his first 'b'days in Oxford, Korbin marveled at the blue skies, so different from northeastern China, and the absence of skyscrapers. All of America, in his TV-fueled imagination, was supposed to look like New York. Beyond its main street and century-old storefronts, Oxford (population 3,500) is a patchwork of gravel pits and horse stables, wooded subdivisions and a strip mall containing a single Chinese restaurant. Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s host family lived in a house on a leafy cul-de-sac, with two basketball hoops in the driveway and a trampoline out back. Suddenly Korbin had four blond American siblings and a host mother he called \xe2\x80\x9cMom.\xe2\x80\x9d His host father worked as an engineer in an automobile industry that blamed the loss of thousands of jobs in the last recession on a single culprit: China.'b'Korbin immersed himself in Americana: football games, big-box stores, even a Christian megachurch with its own rock band. He was hardly alone in his American adventure. Michigan has become a particularly popular destination for Chinese public-high-school students in the United States, and more than a dozen kids from Shenyang lived nearby. Even at Oxford, where Korbin and 23 other students ended up because their academic program in China and its agent, the BCC International Education Group, had partnered with the school, there were another 19 Chinese kids brought in by a Beijing-based company, Weiming Education Group. The two crowds didn\xe2\x80\x99t mix much, in part because most of the Weiming students lived in a dormitory at Rochester College, a liberal-arts Christian school half an hour away. Korbin felt lucky with his American home stay.'b'His life in America was very different from that of his predecessors. When the first Chinese students arrived in the United States in the wake of the Cultural Revolution \xe2\x80\x94 and later, after the 1989 Tiananmen massacre \xe2\x80\x94 many were so poor that they collected aluminum cans or worked janitorial jobs to survive. Today\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese students tend to be far wealthier than their American counterparts, particularly in public high schools. Even among the middle-class students at Oxford, the Chinese kids stirred up envy, and some resentment, by flaunting multiple versions of just-released iPhones. (Korbin had only one.) The Chinese boys carried hundreds of dollars in cash and often wore a different pair of designer sneakers \xe2\x80\x94 Nike, Puma, Adidas \xe2\x80\x94 each day. Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese housemate, Oscar Kou, who liked to talk about his father\xe2\x80\x99s fleet of luxury cars, spent several thousand dollars on a laptop so powerful that it blew out the fuses in their host family\xe2\x80\x99s house.'b'Making American friends wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as simple as Korbin had imagined. In the hallways at Oxford High School, whose student body numbers 1,845, the Chinese kids clustered together, chattering in Mandarin. Korbin longed to interact with his American classmates, but every time he tried, the conversations fizzled when he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t understand their cultural references or slang. Still, Korbin made no secret of his mission. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a Chinese boy,\xe2\x80\x9d he told his classes, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I really, really want to make American friends. It\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing to me.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Perhaps his best chance came at the homecoming dance that fall. As he walked across the floor under the spinning lights of a disco ball, Korbin worked up his nerve and asked an American girl to dance. She just laughed. Another girl, another rejection. Finally, the third entreaty succeeded \xe2\x80\x94 just as a slow song started up and the dancers turned into a tangle of embracing couples. Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s feet stopped, and his arms locked at his sides. \xe2\x80\x9cI totally froze,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. The girl drifted off to rejoin her friends, leaving Korbin alone, wondering if a Chinese boy could ever find his footing in America.'b''b'If your initial'b' encounter with William Skilling took place in the Beijing Capital International Airport, as mine did, it would be easy to take him for a missionary. Dressed in crisply ironed khakis and a white button-down shirt, his short hair meticulously combed, he was headed to a dusty city in the Chinese interior. As superintendent of Oxford Community Schools, Skilling did see himself as a sort of evangelist for global education. On this trip to China, his 19th, he was reviewing plans for Weiming to build its multimillion-dollar dorm on land bordering Oxford High School. \xe2\x80\x9cIt will be the first of its kind at any American public school,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'For Skilling, a former high-school government and economics teacher, the dorm project was the culmination of years of networking with Chinese officials, educators and businessmen. His first foray into the China market came in 2008, when with the Chinese government\xe2\x80\x99s help he started what would become one of the largest Mandarin-language programs in American schools. Today more than 2,300 students in Oxford schools, K through 12, take daily classes in Chinese. \xe2\x80\x9cThe greatest challenge we face in American education,\xe2\x80\x9d Skilling said, \xe2\x80\x9cis preparing students to work and live in a global world that is changing 24-7.\xe2\x80\x9d The Mandarin classes were also part of a local government plan to lure Chinese investment to southeastern Michigan. \xe2\x80\x9cThere was a reason that we, as a state, weren\xe2\x80\x99t making inroads into China,\xe2\x80\x9d Skilling told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThe Chinese knew Michigan was negative, blaming China for its woes. The way to turn this around was to pay China the highest compliment: by building a world-class Mandarin-language program.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Beijing returned the favor. In 2013, Hanban \xe2\x80\x94 the state agency that runs China\xe2\x80\x99s network of controversial Confucius Institutes, which promote Chinese culture, language and propaganda worldwide \xe2\x80\x94 recognized Oxford Community Schools as the \xe2\x80\x9cConfucius Classroom of the Year.\xe2\x80\x9d Skilling parlayed such recognition into sister-school agreements with 20 Chinese schools. Over the past seven years, at least 40 different Oxford teachers and administrators have visited China. One major deal was struck with Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s public school in Shenyang, which opened an international school for Chinese students, like Korbin, aiming to go to an American high school with a famous name.'b'With that deal, Skilling had lined up his first supply of Chinese students for Oxford. He also devised a way around the United States regulations that restricted international students to just one year in public high schools. By inviting a local college to sponsor the F-1 student visas for Chinese students in their second year, Skilling maintained that they could remain at the high school \xe2\x80\x94 and keep paying tuition \xe2\x80\x94 so long as they were also enrolled in and paying tuition for full-time college-level courses. The second year was important: Chinese families want their children to have enough time to prepare for the American college process. The Department of Homeland Security raised no immediate objections, Skilling told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThis had never been done before, so there were no regulations or road maps to follow,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cThis was literally a blank slate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Soon, Oxford was attracting Chinese companies with even bigger ambitions. In a trip to Michigan in late 2012, Weiming\xe2\x80\x99s president, Lin Hao, laid out a vision in which 10,000 Chinese students would enroll in high schools in the United States, starting with experimental districts in the American heartland. Weiming, which bills itself as one of China\xe2\x80\x99s largest private education companies, has followed a similar strategy at home, building 15 campuses with more than 30,000 students in nine provincial cities. As Lin told a visiting superintendent from rural southern Ohio: \xe2\x80\x9cIn China, we have an old saying: \xe2\x80\x98Revolution begins in the countryside.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Within a year, Oxford signed a memorandum of understanding with Weiming that ensured an even greater supply of Chinese students \xe2\x80\x94 up to 200 of them annually for the next 20 years. For each student, Weiming would pay Oxford Community Schools $10,000 a year. It was a boon for a district facing budgetary pressures, but it was significantly less than the $40,000 that Chinese families paid Weiming for the full package of tuition, room and board, insurance and English-support classes. (The company says its fees have since gone down to about $30,500, as it competes for China\xe2\x80\x99s middle-class market.)'b'Weiming also offered American public schools a bigger prize. If the number of Chinese students reached a certain threshold \xe2\x80\x94 from 80 to 100 students \xe2\x80\x94 the company promised to build a multimillion-dollar student center and dormitory, at no cost to the school. As the Weiming contingent at Oxford grew, architects in Beijing and Michigan began drawing up blueprints for the dorm. Shortly after I met Skilling at the airport in the spring of 2014, he returned to Beijing to pore over blueprints of the proposed dorm with Lin. They met in Lin\xe2\x80\x99s office, which was designed to replicate the room where Chairman Mao met President Nixon in 1972 to re-establish relations between their two countries. The wall behind Lin\xe2\x80\x99s desk is covered with antique maps, one for each Chinese province where Weiming has built a school. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be long, perhaps, before a map of Michigan adorned the wall. \xe2\x80\x9cLin Hao and I understand each other,\xe2\x80\x9d Skilling told me, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause we\xe2\x80\x99re both visionaries.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'The loudspeakers in 'b'Oxford High School started blaring halfway through Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s music-appreciation class. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a lockdown!\xe2\x80\x9d a voice announced. \xe2\x80\x9cAn armed intruder has entered the building!\xe2\x80\x9d Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s classmates leapt from their seats and, crouching low, rushed toward the door.'b'Korbin didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand the commotion. His English had improved, but his vocabulary was limited \xe2\x80\x94 and the loudspeakers were always a challenge. He had gotten used to the rock music that played between classes, creating the kind of happy chaos that would never be allowed in a regimented Chinese school. But this time the tone was grave: \xe2\x80\x9cTeachers, secure your classrooms!\xe2\x80\x9d Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s confusion only deepened when the music instructor hustled everyone into the girls\xe2\x80\x99 bathroom next door. \xe2\x80\x9cHurry up!\xe2\x80\x9d she yelled. When Korbin made it to the bathroom stalls, the teacher locked the door behind him \xe2\x80\x94 and they waited, in hushed excitement, until the drill was over.'b'Later, Korbin laughed about the experience. He had nearly forgotten that his mother\xe2\x80\x99s fears about American life \xe2\x80\x94 the guns, riots, school shootings \xe2\x80\x94 had almost scuttled his chances of studying in the United States. His father had made a reconnaissance visit to the country before he started, largely to reassure his wife that it was safe enough for their son. The only dangers Korbin faced in Oxford came from his innocent campaign for American friends.'b'One day, a group of jocks and slackers invited Korbin into the boys\xe2\x80\x99 bathroom for a few puffs from an electronic cigarette. The initiation was unusual for a strait-laced Chinese kid, but he was thrilled to be part of an American posse. \xe2\x80\x9cCool kids never study,\xe2\x80\x9d he was told, so Korbin, until then a conscientious A student, eased off his schoolwork. He started lifting weights, thinking he might attract a girlfriend \xe2\x80\x9cafter I build some muscle.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But when his new friends began pressing Korbin to join in hazing other kids, he pulled away. He wanted nothing to do with shouting racial epithets at the school\xe2\x80\x99s few African-American students or taunting other Chinese kids with curse words in Mandarin. \xe2\x80\x9cI tried so hard to make American friends, but I lost all of my own Chinese style and character,\xe2\x80\x9d Korbin told me last year. \xe2\x80\x9cI am not that eager to be part of American culture anymore. I would like to be myself, Chinese.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'With this part of his American dream tarnished, Korbin buried himself in his studies \xe2\x80\x94 and emerged as a patriot. In September 2015, after Beijing held a missile-studded military parade to celebrate Japan\xe2\x80\x99s defeat in World War II, he posted a picture on social media of the Chinese flag with the words \xe2\x80\x9cGreat China!\xe2\x80\x9d At school, he nearly came to blows with a student who was badmouthing the Chinese \xe2\x80\x9cdictatorship.\xe2\x80\x9d The object of his anger was not an American but a fellow Chinese student.'b'Korbin and Oscar left their host family and moved in with four other Chinese students under the care of a local grandmother. Korbin stopped lifting weights. He no longer wanted an American girlfriend. He barely interacted with American students anyway, because everyone in his college-level classes \xe2\x80\x94 the requirement to maintain his visa during his second year \xe2\x80\x94 was Chinese.'b'Still, Korbin remembers his senior year fondly. After he regained his academic focus, his grade-point average rose to near the top of his class \xe2\x80\x94 a 3.96 \xe2\x80\x94 and his standardized-test scores climbed just in time for his college applications. It felt good to be a nerd again. \xe2\x80\x9cI realized that I\xe2\x80\x99m an only son, the last of my family,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cMy parents pay a lot for me to come here, so why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t I study hard?\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you here'b' for the meeting about the Chinese invasion?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'I had just pulled into the Oxford school parking lot when a bearded man in a baseball cap, an auto engineer, appeared at my car window and grumbled about the subject of that night\xe2\x80\x99s public forum: Weiming\xe2\x80\x99s plan to build its Oxford High School dorm. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it really our job to be educating Chinese kids?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.'b'Until October 2014, Oxford\xe2\x80\x99s move into China\xe2\x80\x99s orbit \xe2\x80\x94 the Mandarin-language program, the influx of Chinese students \xe2\x80\x94 had met little resistance. But the proposed dorm for Chinese students hit a nerve. A board meeting erupted in chaos. The local newspaper, The Oxford Leader, ran an editorial titled \xe2\x80\x9cMaking a Deal With the Devil.\xe2\x80\x9d And now, as the engineer and 60 other residents gathered in the school atrium, Skilling found himself on the defensive. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m here to defuse the situation,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.'b'After touting the benefits of cultural exchange, Skilling outlined the finances. When the school reached its goal of 200 tuition-paying Chinese students, he said, an estimated $1.3 million in annual net revenue would flow into school coffers. The bigger incentive, he argued, was the multimillion-dollar dorm, which would include eight classrooms for use by all students. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t pay a penny,\xe2\x80\x9d Skilling said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a win-win.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Near the end of a contentious question-and-answer session, Skilling talked about how this project would bring money from China back into Michigan. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve heard Donald Trump say that China is trying to take advantage of us,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI agree. We\xe2\x80\x99re willing to sell our souls to get a foot in China, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a mistake.\xe2\x80\x9d A woman behind me whispered to her companion: \xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t that just what he\xe2\x80\x99s done?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Behind the scenes, a group of Oxford citizens began looking into the international program. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think the community objects to having foreign students here,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kallie Roesner-Meyers, a horse-stable owner who started the group, known as Team 20. \xe2\x80\x9cBut there was so much secrecy and misinformation around the whole China setup that we needed to find out more.\xe2\x80\x9d In the spring of 2015, Team 20, which sent the district a flurry of Freedom of Information Act requests, discovered, among other things, that the school board had agreed to a 20-year deal based on Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation.'b'In response to communication from Roesner-Meyers, federal agents questioned Skilling about his consulting work for Weiming. (Skilling says he ceased consulting before the Oxford deal went through.) One of them also wanted to know more about the visa maneuver by which Chinese students were staying for two years instead of one. According to Skilling, the agents said they \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t see any issue,\xe2\x80\x9d and he told a reporter that Roesner-Meyers \xe2\x80\x9cneeds to settle down.\xe2\x80\x9d But the pressure only persisted. Skilling retired later that year, and Weiming, without giving any explanation, put the dorm project on hold.'b'Weiming still has roughly 100 of its students at Oxford. And with thousands more students in its Chinese schools expecting to come to the United States, the search for a flagship location continues. In 2015, the company bid $12.6 million for a 58-acre property in West Hartford, Conn. It proposed to turn the former University of Connecticut site into an international school for 500 students, some of whom would feed into the city\xe2\x80\x99s public high schools. Local officials supported the plan, but last May the City Council, responding to vocal opposition to a little-known Chinese company taking control of land in the city center, voted against it.'b'Hovering in the background of the West Hartford debate was the suspension of the Weiming dorm in Oxford \xe2\x80\x94 and the government\xe2\x80\x99s unresolved investigation into its international program. By November, the Department of Homeland Security offered a verdict. The visa maneuver would not be permitted in the future, a blow to the model Oxford pioneered.'b'Oxford has not been punished, but it will no longer be allowed to keep Chinese students for more than one year on its campus. The current crop of 41 second-year Chinese students has been allowed to stay, though they must now take all of their classes at Rochester College, the institution that sponsors their visas, instead of Oxford High School. In June, after a semester of isolation, these kids will even earn their high-school diplomas. The future of the first-year students is up in the air. They may not be able to graduate from Oxford next year, and it is too late to re-enter China\xe2\x80\x99s 'b'gaokao'b' system. So they and their families may be back on the international-student carousel, scrambling to find another school to attend next year.'b''b'The alphabetical seating 'b'at Oxford High School\xe2\x80\x99s graduation ceremony last June put Korbin Yang in one of the last rows, surrounded by a clutch of Chinese classmates whose surnames begin with the letters X, Y or Z. They formed a sort of school-within-a-school, watching the parade of American graduates they barely knew. Many local students received raucous ovations as they crossed the stage. Korbin\xe2\x80\x99s name \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cgraduating summa cum laude, Jinkai Yang\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 elicited only a muffled clap or two. In the fall, Korbin headed to Pennsylvania State University. His parents were proud that he had gotten into a Top 50 university where almost 2,500 Chinese students were already enrolled.'b'When I visited Korbin last summer in Shenyang, he took me to an American-style craft-beer pub his father partly owns. Over a game of pool, he spoke positively about his experience at Oxford. Still, he admitted, he left Michigan after two years without a single American friend. That surprised him. \xe2\x80\x9cWeirdly, I think the experience made me appreciate Chinese culture even more,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. It\xe2\x80\x99s a common sentiment among Chinese students abroad, who find that their foreign experiences sharpen their sense of national pride. Over the summer, Korbin started delving into Chinese history books and training in kung fu. In America, he found his Chinese core.'b'Now halfway through his first year at Penn State, Korbin can spend entire days without speaking a word of English. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m around my Chinese friends all the time,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t get a chance to know American friends.\xe2\x80\x9d The current political climate may only isolate him further. Korbin is in America legally, studying hard and leaning toward a major in electrical engineering. But how welcoming is a country that increasingly regards his homeland as an economic and security threat? If Trump is serious about being tough on trade, Chinese students, while not in the foreground of such a fight, could be an easy lever for either side to pull. The collateral damage of restricting visas would be devastating, not only for the students themselves but also for high schools and universities, especially across the Midwest, that have become dependent on the billions of dollars the Chinese contribute economically every year.'b'An even bigger threat may lie within China. Late last year, President Xi\xe2\x80\x99s ideological campaign against foreign influences targeted the kind of schools that prepared Korbin for America. How this crackdown will affect the flow of Chinese students overseas is unclear. Parents may be compelled to send their children abroad at even younger ages to escape the closing cage.'b'For Korbin, the lack of American buddies and reawakened sense of national identity notwithstanding, high school in America still left a deep impression on him. Last Christmas, after exams, he went back not to Shenyang, but to Oxford. His second host mother gave him two hoodies and some of his favorite chocolate, and cooked a Christmas meal. Korbin presented her with a mug and played with the dogs he had helped care for as puppies. \xe2\x80\x9cI definitely wish I was still there,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me, and he sounded like just another first-year college kid, missing home.'b''b''b''b''b'As a lonely teenager growing up in Virginia, I fed off any pop culture that could show me different ways of being from what I saw on \xe2\x80\x9cThe Cosby Show\xe2\x80\x9d reruns or read about in an Ann M. Martin book. This was the early 2000s, before social platforms had taken off: LiveJournal was still in its infancy; Tumblr had not yet been created. Friendster and Myspace, the most popular of the networks that did exist, were more about sharing perfectly angled photos than having conversations or bouncing ideas off someone. When, in college, a spirited English teaching assistant (who once canceled class for the week to attend a riot-grrrl punk reunion show in Washington) introduced me to zines and the early feminist publishing movement of the 1990s, I felt as if I had been given a lifeline to the outside world. Those self-published, unofficial magazines offered tangible glimpses of radical feminism, social-justice movements, queer history and subcultures that I always knew existed but had little access to. The world seemed to open up for me.'b'In theory, the maturation of the internet should have killed off the desire for zines entirely. The web is a Gutenberg press on steroids, predicated on free software platforms created by companies that invest considerable sums to lure people to their sites and make exactly the kind of content I craved growing up. Millions, maybe hundreds of millions, of posts are published to social-media sites each day. And yet somehow, it can feel impossible to engage with new ideas, even as our compulsive inability to stop scrolling exposes us to an unending stream of new content. Yes, you can catch tweetstorms on Twitter, watch someone\xe2\x80\x99s life unfold on Instagram, do deep dives into hashtags on Tumblr or watch video diaries on YouTube that explore diverse perspectives, but the clutter of everything else happening at the same time online can make it difficult to really digest and absorb the perspective being offered.'b'Which might be part of the reason zines never disappeared \xe2\x80\x94 and are even available in abundance in 2017. A few months ago, I walked into a Laundromat in Brooklyn where a former cellphone kiosk had been transformed into a feminist queer shop called the Troll Hole. I was thrilled to find it stocked with the same kinds of small booklets I consumed in college, though much better designed and produced. They contained nonbinary coming-of-age stories, photo essays featuring gender nonconforming people of Latin-American descent, trans Muslim narratives, first-generation essays, fat-positive imagery. I scooped up as many as I could rationally read in one sitting.'b'Many of the offline zine projects I came across have some online presence, too. Sula Collective, for example, which describes itself as a journal by and for people of color, actually started out on the web as an art magazine for people growing up \xe2\x80\x9cin the suburbs and Deep South,\xe2\x80\x9d as one of its founders, Kassandra Pi\xc3\xb1ero, put it to me. It was meant for anyone who \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t have access to galleries and events.\xe2\x80\x9d Pi\xc3\xb1ero is 21, and the only world she has ever known is one that is also lived partly online. But she found that publishing on the internet often had the unintended and unconscious effect of causing her to cater to the aesthetics of those platforms. \xe2\x80\x9cThe internet should be a place with no rules, and freedom, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not,\xe2\x80\x9d Pi\xc3\xb1ero said. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a certain pressure to conform to certain aesthetics.\xe2\x80\x9d It was something I had noticed myself. Each social-media platform tends to reward certain behaviors and styles of posting, all in the interest of building fans and followers who are invested in the performance of a persona (maybe even more so than the Geppetto-like person orchestrating it all). Instagram is a place for intimate-seeming photos, Twitter for clever quips and collaborative memes. Facebook demands an unmitigated rawness that can be terrifying at times. With all, the works are often made to fit the platform, not the other way around.'b''b'Producing zines can'b' offer an unexpected respite from the scrutiny on the internet, which can be as oppressive as it is liberating. Shakar Mujukian, publisher of The Hye-Phen \xe2\x80\x94 a zine by and about queer and trans Armenians who, as he puts it, often \xe2\x80\x9cfeel as ignored and invisible as their motherland\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 told me via email that just because technology can fully replace something doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean it should. He described zines as the precursor to personal blogs, but personal blogs have been on the decline over the last decade. And zines can\xe2\x80\x99t get replies or hateful remarks in a comments section. Publishing ideas outside the mainstream can make an author incredibly vulnerable; the web is polluted with a culture of toxicity that invites attacks. Zines, in Mujukian\xe2\x80\x99s vision, \xe2\x80\x9care essentially about reclamation. You get to make your own media and define your own narrative in the way you want to and can.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Karen Gisonny is the periodicals librarian at the New York Public Library and specializes in alternative publications and zines. We\xe2\x80\x99ve spoken over the years about alternative media and the role that it plays among the people who make it and consume it. She noted that zines allow for an \xe2\x80\x9celement of freedom that\xe2\x80\x99s not beholden to anyone.\xe2\x80\x9d We think of the web as a place for freedom, but with zines, authors control every aspect, from the design to the distribution. When I visited her at the library, she showed me some of her newest acquisitions, which included the first issue of Dr. RAD\xe2\x80\x99s Queer Health Show, a guide for self-exams and checkups for all gendered bodies, and Blue Collar Review, a journal of progressive working-class literature that is made in Virginia. She explained that zines could be seen as a historical record of the current moment. To their creators, zines can feel like necessary means of defiance, even resistance to cultural norms that rarely acknowledge them.'b'Devin N. Morris, who edits and publishes 3 Dot Zine, told me that he sees self-publishing as a political and radical act. He\xe2\x80\x99s a young queer artist from Baltimore, and the zines he creates reflect that experience and create a historical narrative that otherwise would be ignored. For him, the act of creating a zine is more about defining his reality on his terms and legitimizing it than it is about the novelty of making indie media and distributing it. It was a sentiment I heard from almost every zine creator I spoke to. Morris, who recently hosted an indie-press fair at the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts, said that zines have a way of encouraging people to have \xe2\x80\x9cinspiring interactions in real life.\xe2\x80\x9d He described a hunger to physically interact beyond simple likes or direct messages. Social apps weren\xe2\x80\x99t made to inspire that desire; they were created so that there would be no need.'b'And it perhaps reflects why zines can feel so much more intimate than a Facebook post. The deliberation and care that goes into making them is important. The internet is especially adept at compressing humanity and making it easy to forget there are people behind tweets, posts and memes.'b''b''b''b''b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not talking politics at all,\xe2\x80\x9d Tom Brady said in response to the first of several 'b'questions about, predictably, politics'b'. Brady has been getting a lot of these, beginning with Super Bowl week\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Night on Monday at Minute Maid Park in Houston. This is not your average 'b'stick-to-sports Super Bowl'b' week in America. The chaos in Washington, bedlam at airports and protests across the country serve as an unsettling crowd noise to even the serene superstar quarterback for the New England Patriots.'b'Brady is friends with President Trump. So are the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 owner, Robert Kraft, and Coach Bill Belichick. No sports team has been more closely associated with a new president, or perhaps any president, at least since Richard Nixon very publicly adopted the Washington Redskins as his own and even called occasional plays for Coach George Allen. Like Trump, the Patriots are a divisive juggernaut that tend to engender strong passions for and against. The team represents a kind of sporting ideal of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s promise to make \xe2\x80\x9cAmerica win so much, you\xe2\x80\x99ll be bored of winning.\xe2\x80\x9d New England, which will appear in an N.F.L.-record ninth Super Bowl on Sunday, is a team that wins so much that a lot of America has become, yes, bored of its winning. And no small number of fans are convinced that the Patriots (like Trump) achieve their victories through dubious means and wish they would just go away and get off their TVs forever.'b'The three main architects of the team\xe2\x80\x99s success \xe2\x80\x94 Kraft, Belichick and Brady \xe2\x80\x94 have taken pains to emphasize that their allegiance to Trump is based on friendship and loyalty, nothing more. They play golf and attend weddings and call to congratulate one another on elections and Super Bowl wins, those kinds of everyday things.'b'They are quick to assert their bipartisan or apolitical bona fides. Kraft has been a supporter of many Democrats and Democratic causes over the years; Belichick declared himself apolitical in response to queries last fall after Trump at a campaign rally in New Hampshire read aloud from an effusive note of congratulations that Belichick had sent him.'b'Brady started getting questions about Trump last fall when a red \xe2\x80\x9cMake America Great Again\xe2\x80\x9d cap was spotted in his Gillette Stadium locker, reportedly put there by Kraft. Brady at first gave sheepish, gee-whiz responses suggesting that it would be cool to have a golf pal as president. (\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99d be a putting green on the White House lawn,\xe2\x80\x9d he predicted.) But the questions took on an edgier urgency as Trump\xe2\x80\x99s victories and offenses kept mounting \xe2\x80\x94 ending with Trump where he is now, and Brady dropping into a reflexive kneel-down every time Trump\xe2\x80\x99s name is mentioned to him.'b'Brady, whose makeshift podium on the Minute Maid field on Monday night was swarmed with a few hundred reporters, was the central battlefield of incoming Trump-related questions. He countered with his most anodyne deflections. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just a positive person\xe2\x80\x9d became Brady\xe2\x80\x99s go-to blow off, which he also deployed in the face of several questions about Deflategate, the air-pressure-in-footballs scandal given new life this week by the prospect of Commissioner Roger Goodell\xe2\x80\x99s having to award the Super Bowl trophy to the man he suspended for four games to begin this season.'b'Other Atlanta Falcons and Patriots players were also invited to weigh in on political matter but mostly demurred. The Falcons receiver Mohamed Sanu, a practicing Muslim, was asked to discuss Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order banning immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries. He declined politely, other than to say that it was \xe2\x80\x9c a very tough situation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chard for me to talk about right now.\xe2\x80\x9d I asked two of the more thoughtful members of the Patriots, the defensive linemen Alan Branch and Chris Long, if they had anything to say about these developments. They absolutely did, they said, and would speak out at some point later, but they did not want to create any \xe2\x80\x9cdistractions\xe2\x80\x9d during Super Bowl week. The Patriots tight end Martellus Bennett did say that if the Patriots won on Sunday and were invited to the White House, he would probably not go, because \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t support the guy that\xe2\x80\x99s in the [White] House.\xe2\x80\x9d And really, was that so distracting?'b'One enduring reason the Patriots are constantly being asked about their Trump connections is that the new president is hardly shy about reminding people of them.'b'He has been dropping Brady\xe2\x80\x99s name \xe2\x80\x94 and Kraft\xe2\x80\x99s, and Belichick\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x94 at every opportunity over the last several months. This first became evident to me in the fall of 2015 as Trump was enjoying his unlikely rise to front-runner status in the Republican primaries and I had several visits with him for a profile I was writing for the magazine. A few months earlier, I had written a story about Brady, who had just won his fourth Super Bowl and was then embroiled in the Deflategate fiasco, in which the league said it was \xe2\x80\x9cmore probable than not\xe2\x80\x9d that Brady was \xe2\x80\x9cat least generally aware\xe2\x80\x9d that a minuscule amount of air pressure might have been removed from the footballs he used in the first half of the Patriots\xe2\x80\x99 45-7 blowout of the Indianapolis Colts in the A.F.C. championship game.'b'When Trump learned that I had recently spent time with Brady and around the Patriots, he became even more animated on the subject \xe2\x80\x94 and insistent that I enlist the star quarterback to say nice things about him for my story. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a good friend of mine,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said about Brady for the first of many times. \xe2\x80\x9cA really good friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d Trump declared himself \xe2\x80\x9cdisgusted\xe2\x80\x9d by the N.F.L.\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of Brady over Deflategate. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s so ridiculous what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing to him.\xe2\x80\x9d He mentioned he had just spoken to Brady.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe said: \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Trump\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 he calls me Mr. Trump, which he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, because we play golf all the time. Anyway, he says: \xe2\x80\x98Mr. Trump \xe2\x80\x94 Donald,\xe2\x80\x99 he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even know what the [expletive] to call me. It\xe2\x80\x99s the craziest thing. He\xe2\x80\x99s a friend of mine.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Also, Kraft \xe2\x80\x94 great friend, great friend. George Steinbrenner \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbig time winner\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 was Trump\xe2\x80\x99s best friend, he said, and now Kraft is right up there, too, as one of his favorite guys. Kraft had visited him a few days earlier, and Trump said he chastised the Patriots owner for not fighting harder against the league\xe2\x80\x99s suspension of Brady, in addition to other sanctions levied by the N.F.L. against the Patriots (including the loss of a first-round draft pick and a record fine). \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, Bob Kraft is also one of my best friends,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI said, \xe2\x80\x98Bob, you should have never made the deal.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBob said, \xe2\x80\x98I had a wink from the commissioner,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Trump added, meaning that Kraft seemed to think that by standing down and not fighting the N.F.L., the league would reduce Brady\xe2\x80\x99s penalty on appeal.'b'Kraft was under pressure, Trump explained. \xe2\x80\x9cHe choked, just like Romney choked. He said: \xe2\x80\x98You know what? They winked at me.\xe2\x80\x99 I said, \xe2\x80\x98Bob when you make a deal, you should have gotten it all wrapped up.\xe2\x80\x99 Who ever heard of making a deal like that? Now you got this mess.\xe2\x80\x9d Kraft should never have trusted Goodell, he said.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe commissioner is a weak guy,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen he made the Ray Rice deal, everybody said: You\xe2\x80\x99re stupid. You\xe2\x80\x99re weak. And it was such a weak deal. So now he\xe2\x80\x99s going overboard with their star, Brady.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He added: \xe2\x80\x9cThe commissioner is a dope. He\xe2\x80\x99s a stupid guy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By far the best deal Kraft ever made was hiring Belichick, Trump said. Who, by the way, is also \xe2\x80\x9ca great, great friend\xe2\x80\x9d of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s, even though everyone just assumes he\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ca really rough guy.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo I go to the Patriots game last year,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m on the sidelines with Kraft. He\xe2\x80\x99s got Les Moonves right here. He\xe2\x80\x99s got a lot of different people. And Belichick comes over in his Patriots sweatshirt and the hoodie and the whole thing. He hugs me, and he kisses me, and he said: \xe2\x80\x98I love you. You\xe2\x80\x99re the greatest.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Trump sat at his cluttered desk and seemed almost dreamy at the memory, as if the reception from Belichick genuinely moved him. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just feels warmly toward me, Belichick does,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said. \xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t that the craziest thing?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'After the Deflategate ruling was handed down by the commissioner that spring, Trump said he tried to persuade Brady to sue the league personally. \xe2\x80\x9cI said, \xe2\x80\x98Tom.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 I gave him a lawyer. \xe2\x80\x94 I said: \xe2\x80\x98Here\xe2\x80\x99s what you do. Sue the N.F.L. for $500 million tomorrow. Sue \xe2\x80\x99em up in Boston, for everything. They\xe2\x80\x99ll come to the table.\xe2\x80\x99 He said, \xe2\x80\x98Aw, man.\xe2\x80\x99 He really was torn. He\xe2\x80\x99s not Trump. He said, \xe2\x80\x98I just want to win another Super Bowl.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Trump told Brady that he understood.'b'A few weeks later, the future president was showing me around Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif. We were accompanied by Damon Winter, a Times photographer who had, a few months earlier, photographed Brady for the profile that was published in February. At one point, as Trump showed me around his 7,242-yard golf Xanadu on the Pacific, he looked over at Winter. \xe2\x80\x9cWho\xe2\x80\x99s got a better body, me or Tom Brady?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. (No answer from Winter that I recall.)'b'In the course of my time with Trump, he kept urging me to call Brady and ask him about his great friendship with Trump. Brady would say great things, no doubt. \xe2\x80\x9cAsk him, \xe2\x80\x98How is Trump as a golfer?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d Trump urged.'b'Brady had been particularly hunkered down during the Deflategate ordeal. N.F.L. politics can be brutal like the real-life kind. Plus, the flare-up in the press over his friendship with Trump was not making Brady any more eager to engage beyond his usual helpings of football platitudes. Finally, after Trump kept insisting, I reached out to Brady, fully expecting a polite stiff-arm from the quarterback, and who could blame him? \xe2\x80\x9cI really have no interest in political talk right now,\xe2\x80\x9d Brady wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI have learned way too much about politics the last seven months.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'H'b'ours before the start of the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March on Washington on Jan. 21, every Metro car leading to the National Mall was packed so tight that it could take on no more riders. At station after station, the train doors would open, and the passengers would look out on throngs of fellow protesters \xe2\x80\x94 women, men, children, babies, the occasional dog \xe2\x80\x94 waiting on the platform. As people emerged from underground into the morning air, it was hard to tell where to go, so they found their way by gauging the human density, moving until they reached a spot so full of people that they could no longer move at all. There was an enormous rally happening somewhere in there \xe2\x80\x94 activists and celebrities speaking into microphones \xe2\x80\x94 but much of the crowd couldn\xe2\x80\x99t see or hear anything except rumbling waves of cheers. By the time they were meant to march, the crowd was so large that it already stretched across the entire route, from the rally site near the Capitol to the Ellipse near the White House.'b'The signs they carried spoke to any number of issues: immigration, abortion, race, the environment, inequality, the new president. REFUGEES WELCOME, KEEP YOUR LAWS OUT OF MY VAGINA, BLACK LIVES MATTER, SCIENCE IS REAL, FLINT NEEDS CLEAN WATER, NOBODY LIKES YOU. The handmade pink \xe2\x80\x9cpussyhats\xe2\x80\x9d that many marchers wore \xe2\x80\x94 a reference to Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s caught-on-tape boasts about grabbing unsuspecting women by the genitals \xe2\x80\x94 had been sneered at in the days before the march. They were called corny, girlie, a waste of time. Seen from above, though, on thousands of marchers, their wave of color created a powerful image.'b'It was, somewhat unexpectedly, one of the largest mass demonstrations in American history. Millions of protesters \xe2\x80\x94 estimates range from three to five million \xe2\x80\x94 took to the streets of Washington, Los Angeles, New York, Palm Beach, Fla., Boise, Idaho, even Fargo, N.D. Sister demonstrations were held in Thailand, in Malawi, in Antarctica. The energy of almost every group alarmed or incensed by Trump\xe2\x80\x99s election seemed to have poured into a single demonstration. That it happened on the day after his inauguration was not surprising. What was striking was that all these people had come together under the auspices of a march for women.'b'Just two months earlier, the left did not appear to be a unified front. The polls had barely closed before the infighting began. Some blamed Hillary Clinton for ignoring Wisconsin, or the Democratic National Committee for boxing other candidates out of the primary field. Some blamed identity politics, which made working-class white voters \xe2\x80\x9cfeel excluded,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Prof. Mark Lilla of Columbia. Others blamed white people, particularly the coastal ones who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get their heartland relatives on their side.'b'But a crew of bummed-out, angry women was still aiming its ire at Trump. In the hours after his victory on Nov. 8, Teresa Shook, a retired lawyer in Hawaii, posted to Facebook, suggesting a march on Washington. Some women on the East Coast had the same idea. At first, these suggestions were so impulsive that they seemed almost metaphorical. But within days, tens of thousands of women had pledged to join in. Over the course of two months, the idea became something far bigger than initially imagined. Eventually, an entire organizing team would have permits, T-shirts, fleets of buses, portable toilets, celebrity sponsors and support from Gloria Steinem. Men meekly asked their female family members and Twitter followers: \xe2\x80\x9cAre we allowed to join?\xe2\x80\x9d By the middle of January, with the event shaping up to be 'b'the'b' anti-Trump demonstration, the New York magazine writer Jonathan Chait worried that \xe2\x80\x9cWomen\xe2\x80\x99s March\xe2\x80\x9d was too niche an organizing principle \xe2\x80\x94 it was a \xe2\x80\x9cbad name,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'he tweeted'b', a divisive \xe2\x80\x9cbrand.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The opposite turned out to be true: Women led the resistance, and everyone followed. A march for women managed to crowd a broad opposition force onto its platform. In the weeks since the march, that energy has only spread. After Trump\xe2\x80\x99s executive order halting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, the march\xe2\x80\x99s striking proof of concept \xe2\x80\x94 hit the streets, and a surprising number of others will join you \xe2\x80\x94 fueled more spontaneous actions in unexpected places: outside courthouses, Trump hotels, airport terminals, the offices of Senator Mitch McConnell. At each protest, you were likely to see a few pink cat ears poking out of the crowd, a reminder of the opposition\xe2\x80\x99s first gathering. It seems unlikely that any other kind of march would have turned out quite this way. In this moment, it happened that \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x9d was the one tent large enough to contain almost every major strain of protest against Trump.'b'Those who know their feminist history might see a paradox here. The women\xe2\x80\x99s movement has not always been a site for unity. It has been marked just as deeply by its fractures, failures and tensions. But more than a century of internal turmoil has also forced the movement to reckon with its divisions. Now, the question is whether it can bring even more Americans into the fold.'b''b'Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s loss on Nov. 8'b' was a pivotal, identity-shifting moment in the course of the American women\xe2\x80\x99s movement. In an evening, the would-be first female president was shoved to the side by what a sizable chunk of the nation saw as that classic historical figure: the male chauvinist pig. In parts of the popular imagination, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just a loss for Clinton or for the Democratic Party. It was a repudiation of feminism itself.'b'But Clinton has always been a wary avatar of feminism. In 2008, she didn\xe2\x80\x99t run for president as a \xe2\x80\x9cwomen\xe2\x80\x99s candidate\xe2\x80\x9d; if anything, she campaigned with her sex in the closet and the strategist Mark Penn advising her to harden her image into an American Iron Lady. \xe2\x80\x9cThey do not want someone who would be the first mama,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in one memo. Years later, HBO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cVeep\xe2\x80\x9d would satirize that posture through its own fictional politician. \xe2\x80\x9cI can\xe2\x80\x99t identify myself as a woman!\xe2\x80\x9d she tells her staff. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople can\xe2\x80\x99t know that. Men hate that. And women who hate women hate that, which I believe is most women.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the eight years between Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s first and second presidential campaigns, though, something shifted: Feminism became fashionable. By the start of the Obama era, incisive women\xe2\x80\x99s blogs like Jezebel and Feministing had already hit the web and started throwing popcorn at the big screen of American culture, covering the same topics that women\xe2\x80\x99s magazines did \xe2\x80\x94 fashion, movies, sex \xe2\x80\x94 but taking on the women\xe2\x80\x99s magazines too. By Obama\xe2\x80\x99s second term, this model had thrived and multiplied so many times over that even a co-founder of the sports website Bleacher Report started his own women\xe2\x80\x99s site, Bustle. Soon enough, no corner of culture was safe from a feminist critique, from Christmas songs to \xe2\x80\x9cmanspreading.\xe2\x80\x9d Pop stars \xe2\x80\x94 people like Lady Gaga, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift \xe2\x80\x94 were asked if they were feminists, and if they shied away from the label, outrage would greet them online.'b'Feminism became increasingly popular, but in a very specific way \xe2\x80\x94 one attuned to the concerns of people with office jobs and time to spend online. The feminist priorities of this new media landscape tended to involve topics that middle-class women would experience firsthand: reproductive rights, catcalling, campus rape, professional opportunity, pop-culture representation. The writers setting its tone tended to be young women who were asked to produce large amounts of clickable copy, for not much money, in very little time, exploring feminist issues not through time-intensive reporting but through \xe2\x80\x9ctakes\xe2\x80\x9d on the women already making news: the work-life balance of Yahoo\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Marissa Mayer; the pay gap between Jennifer Lawrence and her male co-stars. Some content chased sexist slights down to the most passing personal concerns, like 'b'an item from The Huffington Post'b' that sighed: \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no proper way for a woman to cut her hair, let alone do anything right in this world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s not that women\xe2\x80\x99s activist groups vanished or political organizing stalled. But it did become possible for an American woman to cultivate a relationship to feminism that was primarily consumerist: There were feminist TV shows to watch, feminist celebrities to follow, feminist clothes to buy. Unlike many other major social movements, women\xe2\x80\x99s liberation dovetails neatly with an important advertising demographic, a lesson capitalism absorbed more than a century ago. In 1908, the advertiser J.Walter Thompson hired suffragists to address the growing women\xe2\x80\x99s market. Over the next decades, the industry would slip women\xe2\x80\x99s rights messaging into ad copy. Old Dutch Cleanser offered \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom from household drudgery\xe2\x80\x9d; Shredded Wheat promised a \xe2\x80\x9cdeclaration of independence\xe2\x80\x9d from cooking. These days, even our bath products have achieved empowerment. Ads for Secret deodorant nudge us to ask for a raise, and those for Always prompt us to challenge stereotypes about girls. Dove wants us to feel beautiful at any size.'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s telling which strand of feminism these brands have deemed marketable: the one that doubles as self-help. This is a vision of feminism in which the primary thing that needs to change is a woman\xe2\x80\x99s frame of mind. Something similar happened to the pop stars who once hesitated to call themselves feminists \xe2\x80\x94 they came around to feminism by redefining feminism around themselves. To Lady Gaga, feminism was about protecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe integrity of women who are ambitious.\xe2\x80\x9d Taylor Swift realized, she said, that she had \xe2\x80\x9cbeen taking a feminist stance without actually saying so.\xe2\x80\x9d Feminism was being defined down to its most benign interpretation. It was less a political platform than a brand identity.'b'In 2013, \xe2\x80\x9cLean In,\xe2\x80\x9d by Sheryl Sandberg, raised this pop-cultural subtext to the level of text. Sandberg called the book \xe2\x80\x9csort of a feminist manifesto,\xe2\x80\x9d but it preached individual solutions to systemic problems, encouraging women to focus on \xe2\x80\x9cinternal obstacles\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdismantle the hurdles in ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d This feminist mode, where personal success becomes synonymous with social progress, can be plugged into any number of political orientations. The latest model for the corporate-celebrity feminist brand is Ivanka Trump, who has built a lifestyle company under the hashtag #WomenWhoWork. A recent pitch neatly weds activist language with shoppable solutions: \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re committed to solving problems. If we can\xe2\x80\x99t find a solution, we\xe2\x80\x99ll make it ourselves (case in point: the Soho Tote, the ultimate work bag).\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By the time the 2016 campaign rolled around, Clinton wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just permitted to run as a feminist \xe2\x80\x94 she was practically obligated to. Her messaging shifted accordingly. Years of women\xe2\x80\x99s debating the right way to be a feminist had the side effect of forcing the first female major-party candidate to the left. In 2008, she argued that she wanted abortion to be \xe2\x80\x9csafe, legal and rare \xe2\x80\x94 and by rare I mean rare.\xe2\x80\x9d In last year\xe2\x80\x99s debates, she stopped qualifying her support. \xe2\x80\x9cI will defend Planned Parenthood,\xe2\x80\x9d she said in one. \xe2\x80\x9cI will defend Roe v. Wade, and I will defend women\xe2\x80\x99s rights to make their own health care decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, her campaign mimicked the aesthetics of the pop-cultural feminist mode. The candidate affirmed her feminism in a video interview with Lena Dunham, posed in a Kim Kardashian selfie and made a cameo on \xe2\x80\x9cBroad City.\xe2\x80\x9d Her campaign posted a BuzzFeed-style listicle informing Latinos that Clinton was \xe2\x80\x9cjust like your 'b'abuela'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d (With the Twitter hashtag #NotMyAbuela, those voters begged to differ.) Her site sold embroidered pillows that said \xe2\x80\x9cA Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Place Is in the White House\xe2\x80\x9d and a T-shirt with a big \xe2\x80\x9cYAAAS, HILLARY!\xe2\x80\x9d printed over her senior portrait from high school. After Trump accused her of playing \xe2\x80\x9cthe woman\xe2\x80\x99s card,\xe2\x80\x9d her campaign introduced a free hot-pink \xe2\x80\x9cOfficial Hillary for America Woman Card\xe2\x80\x9d that drove more than $2 million in donations within days. One young woman earnestly prodded her at an Iowa campaign event: \xe2\x80\x9cIf you could choose, would you rather be the president or Beyonc\xc3\xa9?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Pop feminism, having been washed of its political urgency, was now being integrated back into politics at the highest level. The candidate who once shrank from feminism was positioning herself as an icon of the movement. Her image became closely aligned with two metaphors \xe2\x80\x94 the pantsuit and the glass ceiling \xe2\x80\x94 that speak to a particular kind of woman: a corporate careerist at the top of her field. A \xe2\x80\x9csecret\xe2\x80\x9d Facebook group, 'b'Pantsuit Nation'b', popped up to encourage Clinton supporters to wear pantsuits to the polls. When she clinched the Democratic nomination for president last June \xe2\x80\x94 the one she would formally accept the following month, dressed in suffragist white \xe2\x80\x94 Clinton called back to the Seneca Falls convention of 1848, where \xe2\x80\x9ca small but determined group of women, and men, came together with the idea that women deserved equal rights.\xe2\x80\x9d The feminist project started there, she implied \xe2\x80\x94 and she was going to finish it.'b'When Clinton lost, pop feminism suffered a crisis. As everyone pored over exit polls, some of the long-simmering fractures between different groups of women exploded into view. Ninety-four percent of black women voted for Clinton, but 53 percent of white women voted for Trump, perhaps more likely to see themselves in his vision of the world than in the pop feminism that fed Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s campaign. Despite Trump\xe2\x80\x99s palpable, eminently bloggable disrespect for women \xe2\x80\x94 and that infamous tape \xe2\x80\x94 he had successfully courted a faction of female voters. His win suggested that Americans were more comfortable with misogyny than many had thought, but it also burst the bubble of cheery pop feminism, which had achieved its huge popularity at the expense of class consciousness and racial solidarity.'b'In some places, you could watch the mood turn in a matter of days. The Pantsuit Nation Facebook group ceased its celebrations and became a site for sharing stories of pain and resilience. But when the group\xe2\x80\x99s founder, a Maine educator named Libby Chamberlain, announced a plan to channel the power of the group in real life, it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly a call to activism \xe2\x80\x94 it was a coffee-table book. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are a force, Pantsuit Nation,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s see if we can harness that force within the pages of a book and see it on night stands and coffee tables all around the world.\xe2\x80\x9d The idea brought on a revolt. \xe2\x80\x9cThe N.R.A. with its five million members has a stranglehold on Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d one commenter wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cPantsuit Nation has four million members and decides its main mission is \xe2\x80\x98storytelling\xe2\x80\x99 and now, selling books. What a colossal waste.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But for some outside observers, this was a productive comeuppance. Rhon Manigault-Bryant, an associate professor of Africana studies at Williams College in Massachusetts, published \xe2\x80\x9cAn Open Letter to White Liberal Feminists,\xe2\x80\x9d 'b'on the website Black Perspectives'b', expressing her disappointment that it had taken Donald Trump to shake them into her reality. \xe2\x80\x9cI am delighted that you have received the potential awakening of a lifetime, and that now you might actually get what so many of us have been describing all along,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cWelcome to that deep perpetual angst. Embrace it, and allow it to motivate you to a deeper form of action.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'In those same'b' November weeks, the nascent march-on-Washington project was navigating its own identity crisis. Some of the early organizers had romantic-comedy-type jobs \xe2\x80\x94 pastry chef, yoga instructor. One of the women, Bob Bland, a fashion designer, had amassed a small online following by designing \xe2\x80\x9cNASTY WOMAN\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBAD HOMBRE\xe2\x80\x9d T-shirts and selling them online. \xe2\x80\x9cI had this whole network of \xe2\x80\x98nasty women\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98bad hombres,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cAfter the election, they were looking to me like, \xe2\x80\x98What are we going to do next?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Disparate organizers convened around a Facebook event announcing a Million Women March. There was one major problem with this: In 1997, activists organized a Million Woman March in Philadelphia to address the particular concerns of black women. When this new march on Washington unwittingly chose a very similar name, it crystallized the idea that the nascent movement was being run by a handful of white women with no organizing history. Comments began pouring in from all sides.'b'The organizers had stumbled into a conflict that has dogged women\xe2\x80\x99s organizing from the very beginning: Of all the tensions that have coursed through the women\xe2\x80\x99s movement, none has ever been quite so pronounced as the one between white and black women. Consider what happened when Sojourner Truth showed up at a women\xe2\x80\x99s rights convention in Ohio in 1851. Frances Gage, the woman running the show, recalled the scene 12 years later: \xe2\x80\x9cThe leaders of the movement trembled on seeing a tall, gaunt black woman in a gray dress and white turban, surmounted with an uncouth sunbonnet, march deliberately into the church, walk with the air of a queen up the aisle and take her seat upon the pulpit steps.\xe2\x80\x9d A \xe2\x80\x9cbuzz of disapprobation\xe2\x80\x9d spread through the church. White women in attendance complained that a black woman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony would distract from the convention\xe2\x80\x99s focus. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let her speak, Mrs. Gage \xe2\x80\x94 it will ruin us,\xe2\x80\x9d one said. \xe2\x80\x9cEvery newspaper in the land will have our cause mixed up with abolition and niggers, and we shall be utterly denounced.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Throughout the convention, men arrived to speak out against women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage. Women, they said, were too weak and helpless to be trusted with the power of the vote. Because \xe2\x80\x9cthere were very few women in those days who dared to \xe2\x80\x98speak in meeting,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d as Gage put it, their points went unchallenged until Truth stepped forward. White women hissed, but Truth\xe2\x80\x99s very identity nullified the arguments coming from both men and women in attendance. \xe2\x80\x9cThat man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages, and lifted over ditches, and to have the best place everywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cNobody ever helps me into carriages, or over mud puddles, or gives me any best place. And ain\xe2\x80\x99t I a woman? Look at me! Look at my arm!\xe2\x80\x9d She rolled up her sleeve to the shoulder. \xe2\x80\x9cI have plowed and planted, and gathered into barns, and no man could head me. And ain\xe2\x80\x99t I a woman?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In that moment, Truth shattered an idea of white femininity that had been used to both underpin and undermine the cause of suffrage. As a slave, she had worked in the fields like a man; as a free black woman, she could not rely on the offerings of white male gentility. Gage wrote that Truth\xe2\x80\x99s testimony compelled the white women in attendance to embrace her \xe2\x80\x9cwith streaming eyes, and hearts beating with gratitude.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'But two years later, Truth still drew jeers from white crowds when she attended women\xe2\x80\x99s meetings. A vision of whiteness was ingrained in the leaders and the arguments of the mainstream movement. Even the suffragists\xe2\x80\x99 signature white clothes were deliberately chosen to signal purity. This ideal of feminine virtue did not extend to black women, or working-class ones. Some suffragists made their racism and classism explicit. In 1894, a white woman at a meeting of the Brooklyn Woman Suffrage Association complained that New York had become an \xe2\x80\x9casylum for the trash of all nations,\xe2\x80\x9d arguing that women\xe2\x80\x99s suffrage ought to be restricted. \xe2\x80\x9cThink what it means to give it to all women,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur criminal and pauper men have wives; there are thousands of female operatives in tobacco factories and similar fields of labor; there are probably two million Negro women in this country who are but little uplifted above the plane of animals.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'One curious point of this history is that so many suffragists came from the antislavery movement. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, whose partnership would come to define the suffrage movement in the United States, started their activist careers as abolitionists. But after the Civil War, as black men and all women agitated for the right to vote, a political battle broke out over who would be enfranchised first. (Either way, black women would be last.) In 1865, Stanton lamented having to \xe2\x80\x9cstand aside to see \xe2\x80\x98Sambo\xe2\x80\x99 walk into the kingdom first,\xe2\x80\x9d as she put it in The National Anti-Slavery Standard.'b'Over time, these racial contours would harden into lasting institutions. When women\xe2\x80\x99s social clubs spread across the United States at the turn of the century, two models emerged. Whites-only clubs leveraged middle-class women\xe2\x80\x99s leisure time to campaign for social reforms. Black women, who largely worked outside the home, came together around urgent needs. One of the first actions of the black Chicago Women\xe2\x80\x99s Club was to raise money to prosecute a police officer who killed a black man. The main distinction between clubs, the black activist Fannie Barrier Williams wrote, was that for black women, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not a fad.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Black women distinguished themselves not only as suffragists but also as vocal critics of a movement that pushed one kind of justice aside in pursuit of another. In 1913, when thousands of suffragists marched on Washington to agitate for the vote, black women were instructed to march in the back. Ida B. Wells defied the order and marched with the delegation from Illinois, her home state. She wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just protesting for her right to vote. She was protesting the protest too.'b'This dynamic is not only a thing of distant history: In the thick of feminism\xe2\x80\x99s second wave, women were often still divided along lines of identity. In 1967, as the best-selling author Betty Friedan called the first meeting of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women, she found herself at odds with a black activist and lawyer named Flo Kennedy, who pushed the women around her to make common cause with the antiwar and Black Power movements. Friedan and the meeting\xe2\x80\x99s host \xe2\x80\x94 Muriel Fox, the highest-ranking female executive at the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest public-relations agency \xe2\x80\x94 were not pleased. As Kennedy put it in her memoirs, they \xe2\x80\x9cwent bonkers.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Friedan\xe2\x80\x99s 1963 book, \xe2\x80\x9cThe Feminine Mystique,\xe2\x80\x9d had been an awakening for a class of white, married, middle-class women, and she pictured herself as the leader of what she called a \xe2\x80\x9cmainstream\xe2\x80\x9d feminist movement. When women at one 1970 march offered her a lavender armband to wear in solidarity with a NOW member recently attacked for her bisexuality, Friedan dropped it on the ground, furious at the attempt to add gay rights to her program.'b'Kennedy continually pushed in the opposite direction, trying to build bridges between feminist groups and other movements. At one point, Friedan admonished her to leave the feminist movement alone and \xe2\x80\x9cfocus her attention on matters of Black Power.\xe2\x80\x9d As the second wave matured, black women found themselves continually calling on it to consider a new approach, one that acknowledged the different needs of different women. As the black feminist and leftist Barbara Smith told the National Women\xe2\x80\x99s Studies Association in 1979, any feminism that didn\xe2\x80\x99t account for the specific concerns of black women, poor women, disabled women, lesbians and others was not really feminism \xe2\x80\x94 it was \xe2\x80\x9cmerely female self-aggrandizement.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'There has never'b' been one women\xe2\x80\x99s movement. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult, for example, to say that the American feminist project started in Seneca Falls, N.Y., in 1848, because black women were not invited to that convention. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to say that electing a woman as president would have been feminism\xe2\x80\x99s crowning achievement, because the success of one woman does not naturally trickle down to all. The history of the women\xe2\x80\x99s movement is one of warring factions and sharp self-criticism. But its 150 years of navigating internal disputes put it in a position to lead what seemed, at the end of last fall, like a highly divided left.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s embarrassing to me now to say it, but I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know the term \xe2\x80\x98intersectionality\xe2\x80\x99 when we started,\xe2\x80\x9d Bob Bland, the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March co-chairwoman, told me. Now she deployed it often to emphasize the growing diversity of the march. She told various reporters that she had met women working \xe2\x80\x9cin so many different intersectionalities\xe2\x80\x9d and hoped to reach a \xe2\x80\x9ca wide intersectionality of people\xe2\x80\x9d in a march that reflected \xe2\x80\x9call of the different intersections of human rights.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'That magic word comes from a 1989 paper by the legal scholar Kimberl\xc3\xa9 Crenshaw that was published in The University of Chicago Legal Forum. Crenshaw had studied cases in which black women sued their employers for what appeared to be \xe2\x80\x9ccompound discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 both racial and gender biases. But they were often told they lacked legal standing: Laws protected them from discrimination as African-Americans or as women, but not specifically as black women. Crenshaw used a traffic metaphor to describe the interlocking forms of oppression a person might face. Cars flowed through an intersection in all directions; when an accident happened, it could be caused by cars from any number of sides, or even all sides.'b'That metaphor would be plucked from Crenshaw\xe2\x80\x99s paper and grow in resonance over the next two decades, until \xe2\x80\x9cintersectionality\xe2\x80\x9d became a rallying cry \xe2\x80\x94 the main point of rhetorical resistance against the tide of single-issue feminist conversation. Even beneath the shiny surface of Obama-era pop feminism, dissenters took countless shots at its racial cluelessness, its lack of class-consciousness, its sometimes shallow concerns. Women of color convened on Twitter under hashtags like #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen to detail their experiences of being sidelined in feminist conversations, and many on the left criticized the way a trickle-down, professional-oriented feminism was becoming popular just as income inequality between women was ballooning. (It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to \xe2\x80\x9clean in\xe2\x80\x9d to a job cleaning hotel rooms.) In recent years, intersectionality even popped up in People.com, on Bustle and in a tweet from Clinton.'b'Often the criticism that lies behind this word is brushed off, met with defensiveness, taken personally. (As the founder of Pantsuit Nation wrote to critics of her book deal: \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not the place for divisiveness.\xe2\x80\x9d) Women turn to feminism because they want to stand up and say something; it can be jarring for them be told to sit down and listen to someone else. But the concept became a useful tool for the march on Washington, which set about the task of uniting feminism\xe2\x80\x99s mainstream, popular arm and its dissenting factions \xe2\x80\x94 all in the space of two months.'b'Soon after the suggestion to march raced across the web, Vanessa Wruble \xe2\x80\x94 a white producer and co-founder of the media company OkayAfrica \xe2\x80\x94 made a pivotal intervention in its planning. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought the stakes were so high,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIt needed to be an inclusive movement, or it was going to be a total disaster. I felt that it could damage the country.\xe2\x80\x9d At this critical moment, with the march quickly ballooning into something bigger than the initial organizers could handle on their own, Wruble reached out and urged them to drop the name Million Women March. Then she linked them up with her network, and soon three seasoned activists \xe2\x80\x94 Carmen Perez, Linda Sarsour and Tamika Mallory \xe2\x80\x94 got on board. These women hadn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily supported Clinton, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily identify as feminists. But they had experience organizing in communities of color and saw the march as an opportunity to reach a large new audience. When Sarsour got the call, she had just posted a comment on the march\xe2\x80\x99s Facebook page: \xe2\x80\x9cCan you include Muslim women and Muslim communities in the list?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The three women \xe2\x80\x94 one Chicana Latina, one Palestinian-American, one black \xe2\x80\x94 met through their involvement in Justice League NYC, a juvenile-justice initiative. In 2015, they organized a nine-day march from New York to Washington, ending in a rally at the Capitol that drew a small crowd. Now hundreds of thousands of women whose previous interest in justice may have been abstract at best were turning to them for leadership. The question, Perez told me, was \xe2\x80\x9cHow do we get them to understand that their liberation is bound with ours?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Meanwhile, the three had some catching up to do with the mainstream feminist perspective. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of what I would consider to be deep, transformative relationships with white women,\xe2\x80\x9d Sarsour told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve been learning a lot,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, and working toward becoming \xe2\x80\x9cmore comfortable around this movement of feminism that I always felt didn\xe2\x80\x99t particularly include Muslim women.\xe2\x80\x9d The organizers appeared on the hip-hop radio morning show \xe2\x80\x9cThe Breakfast Club\xe2\x80\x9d and loaded their Instagram page with black feminist heroes. But they also posed for windswept photos in Vogue, and some dropped by the Wing, a private Manhattan women\xe2\x80\x99s club with a $2,250 annual membership fee. Their rally put Angela Davis on the same stage as Scarlett Johansson.'b'When I called Kimberl\xc3\xa9 Crenshaw in January, she had just returned home to Los Angeles from the march on Washington, where she walked with a group of women from the African American Policy Forum. Her group was so far back in the crowd that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hear the rally, and \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m kind of glad about it,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were in this sea of humanity.\xe2\x80\x9d Wading through the crowd, she said, \xe2\x80\x9cI saw all the different issues and people that had found their way under the banner of the Women\xe2\x80\x99s March. It was the embodiment of the intersectional sensibilities that a lot of us have been working on for a very long time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The women\xe2\x80\x99s movement\xe2\x80\x99s tendency toward a singular perspective is \xe2\x80\x9cnot an exceptional problem for feminism,\xe2\x80\x9d Crenshaw told me. \xe2\x80\x9cPatriarchy works in such a way that these critiques never even surface in a lot of movements led by men. This conversation isn\xe2\x80\x99t always happening in other spaces. And if the conversation leads to more robust ways of thinking about women, feminism and social justice, it can be a very good thing.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe million-dollar question is: Can these feminisms live together under an anti-Trump banner?\xe2\x80\x9d Crenshaw said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt happened for 24 hours all across the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'When I made'b' my way back to my hotel after the march, the cheers of the crowd fading into the distance, I opened my laptop and saw a different version of what I had just seen in person. Now it was all filtered through my own social-media bubble \xe2\x80\x94 that of a middle-class white woman who lives in Brooklyn. Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s trending topics, tailored to fulfill each user\xe2\x80\x99s particular online habits, served me up a pop-celebrity version of the day\xe2\x80\x99s events. It pointed me toward the speeches of Scarlett Johansson and Madonna, and nobody else. As scenes of the march traveled through the media and across the web, the story spun out in even more directions. Twitter lit up with notes of internal dissent and snapshots of signs from the march: DON\xe2\x80\x99T FORGET: WHITE WOMEN VOTED FOR TRUMP and BLACK WOMEN TRIED TO SAVE Y\xe2\x80\x99ALL and I\xe2\x80\x99LL SEE YOU NICE WHITE LADIES AT THE NEXT #BLACKLIVESMATTER MARCH, RIGHT?'b'But for the moment, at least, Trump appears to be the great uniter. In the days and weeks since the march, its energy spilled into spontaneous actions across the country, with protesters coming together on behalf of Muslims and immigrants. Donations poured into Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union. Congressional switchboards were inundated with calls. When 'b'The Washington Post polled Americans'b' post-march, it registered a huge shift in energy among Democrats, especially Democratic women, 40 percent of whom said they planned to get more involved in activism.'b'But liberals are not the only ones drawing inspiration from the protests. Flip to Fox News, click around conservative blogs or browse pro-Trump Twitter, and you can watch the demonstrations fuel a different kind of opposition narrative. After the march, Fox News set clips of rally speeches to foreboding music. Breitbart published photos with the headline \xe2\x80\x9cSee what a massive, Hillary shaped bullet America just dodged?\xe2\x80\x9d The right-wing Media Research Center aggregated the most \xe2\x80\x9cvile and ridiculous signs.\xe2\x80\x9d Twitter exploded with anti-Muslim attacks on Linda Sarsour, who was called a \xe2\x80\x9cterrorist\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cloves ISIS.\xe2\x80\x9d When the annual March for Life hit the Mall to demonstrate against abortion rights, The Blaze called it \xe2\x80\x9cthe real women\xe2\x80\x99s march.\xe2\x80\x9d (The Women\xe2\x80\x99s March did, at one point, remove the name of an anti-abortion group from its list of partners, after an uproar.) 'b'According to Public Policy Polling'b', 48 percent of Trump voters think the protesters who convened at airports to protest the travel ban were paid by George Soros. Trump tweeted recently: \xe2\x80\x9cProfessional anarchists, thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In the first weeks of the Trump administration, the factions that split over his election are deepening along the same lines. Each side seems oddly confident in its political position. Trump supporters call themselves \xe2\x80\x9cthe silent majority,\xe2\x80\x9d while his critics identify as the \xe2\x80\x9cpopular vote.\xe2\x80\x9d When I called Eleanor Smeal, a co-founder of the Feminist Majority Foundation, and asked her whether the organization had any plans to reach out to the 53 percent of white women who voted for Trump, her response was to question the margin of error in the polls. \xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t really know if we lost the majority or not, and I believe that we did not,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me. \xe2\x80\x9cI think they\xe2\x80\x99re with us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For now, the factions of the left seem to have found an accord. But to regain any power in Washington, they will need to sway the center too \xe2\x80\x94 including some of those women who voted for Trump. The white women of the left, many of whom are just now finding their footing as activists, have been eager to dissociate from that group. Mention the 53 percent, and they\xe2\x80\x99re quick to tell you that they\xe2\x80\x99re of the 47. But of all the people who marched on Washington last month, they may be among the best positioned to reach across that aisle. \xe2\x80\x9cI know of no other time when it would be more important,\xe2\x80\x9d Barbara Smith, the black feminist and leftist, told me. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not my work to do, but somebody ought to do it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''b''b'W'b'hen Indira Islas was in third grade at Centennial Arts Academy, a public elementary school in Gainesville, Ga., she decided it was time to get serious. It was 2006, and she was in the lowest reading group in her class. She had been in that group since arriving two years earlier, speaking no English, in Gainesville, a city of 38,000 just northeast of Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s booming outer suburbs. But being at the bottom went against everything she believed about herself. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to be with the smart kids,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalls. Starting the year before, in second grade, she read every volume of the \xe2\x80\x9cMagic Tree House\xe2\x80\x9d books in her elementary-school library, a series about two ordinary siblings who climb into their backyard treehouse and time-travel to Pompeii, the Wild West, the ice age, feudal Japan and beyond. \xe2\x80\x9cI absolutely loved them,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was like going on adventures all over the world.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was also the opposite of her own life. Indira left Mexico for the United States at age 6 with her parents and two younger sisters. Her mother cleaned houses when she wasn\xe2\x80\x99t caring for the children \xe2\x80\x94 there would eventually be seven of them \xe2\x80\x94 and her father worked in construction, and there was no money for after-school lessons or soccer clubs, let alone traveling. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d hear about trips and experiences of my white friends, and I remember thinking: I\xe2\x80\x99ll never go to the beach or Disney World for spring break,\xe2\x80\x9d Indira says. Her parents told her that education was all that mattered, and she had to spend all her free time inside, reading and writing. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell my children this country is a blessing to all the people living here,\xe2\x80\x9d her mother told me. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have the opportunity to be good, it\xe2\x80\x99s very important to take it.\xe2\x80\x9d Indira took this advice to heart. By the time she was in fifth grade, her reading skills had improved so much that she tested into the top reading group. By middle school, she consistently got A\xe2\x80\x99s, which qualified her for a celebratory school trip every time report cards came out. \xe2\x80\x9cThey rewarded us by taking us skating or bowling,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I was so smart, just getting the chance to go out for the whole school day with friends. That\xe2\x80\x99s when I said: \xe2\x80\x98I can make it.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indira began to throw herself into everything. At recess, she played soccer and basketball, competing so fiercely that everyone took notice. Boys usually picked other boys for their teams, and white kids tended to favor other white kids. But everyone started picking Indira. In middle school, she was on the track team, running long-distance races. Her coach was stunned by her determination. In meets, even when she won her event, she scolded herself unless she broke her previous record. After practices ended, she would keep running. \xe2\x80\x9cI wanted to think,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d stay after practice and run and run and run.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indira remembers understanding vaguely that it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t just poverty that set her and her family apart. Her parents had been doctors in Mexico. She admired pictures in their dresser drawer of the two of them in their 20s standing together, tall and proud in their white coats \xe2\x80\x94 before they all fled the violence of drug gangs who were then taking over their home state, Guerrero. When she asked her parents why they were no longer doctors, they explained it was because they were not American citizens. It didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to Indira. Why would her father have shed that beautiful crisp white coat for the fraying pants and shirts he now wore?'b'Soon after Indira turned 13, in 2011, she was riding home from track practice with her mother when another car sideswiped the family\xe2\x80\x99s Ford Expedition. The other driver, who was at fault, insisted on calling the police, according to Indira and a lawyer who assisted the family. Indira pleaded not to involve the police, explaining that her mother did not have a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license because she was not an American citizen. (In Georgia and most other states, undocumented immigrants cannot obtain driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses.) But the driver said she needed a police report to get insurance to cover the damage to her car.'b'A police officer arrived and asked for Indira\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s license. When she said she did not have one \xe2\x80\x94 a state crime \xe2\x80\x94 she was told to get out of the car. Indira got out, too. She remembers two of her younger siblings sleeping in the back, one in a booster seat, one in a car seat. Two elders from the church they attended arrived to ask for mercy. She has seven children, they told the officer. He responded that he was simply enforcing the law. Indira\xe2\x80\x99s mother turned to her and began to cry. \xe2\x80\x9cIndira, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what is going to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re going to take me.\xe2\x80\x9d Indira remembers remaining strangely calm. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen she was being handcuffed, I said: \xe2\x80\x98Mom, everything is going to be O.K.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indira\xe2\x80\x99s mother was held in Gainesville\xe2\x80\x99s Hall County jail for three days, but that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the most frightening part for the family. Hall is one of four counties in Georgia that have 'b'a formal agreement'b' to report arrests of undocumented immigrants to the Department of Homeland Security, which means that infractions as minor as a burned-out bulb above a license plate can spiral into deportation proceedings. Indira\xe2\x80\x99s mother says that her charge of driving without a license ultimately led to a referral to immigration court and a deportation order instructing her to leave the country within 30 days. She stayed, slipping into the shadows. Every day since, Indira says, she and her siblings have feared that their mother would be deported. It would take only one more traffic stop.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat woke me up,\xe2\x80\x9d Indira says. \xe2\x80\x9cUntil then, I thought the world was happy.\xe2\x80\x9d In fact, she now realized, it was only American citizens who seemed truly happy. \xe2\x80\x9cIt must feel pretty good, I guess, to not have to worry about whether your family could be taken away any day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Indira has wanted'b' to be a doctor for almost as long as she can remember. When she was 10, her family was shopping for groceries at Sam\xe2\x80\x99s Club, and she spotted a large book about human anatomy. She became so excited about it that her parents bought it for her birthday, even though it was well above her reading level \xe2\x80\x94 and their price range. She began working her way through it, mesmerized, and when she got stuck, her mother would explain whatever had stumped her.'b'She was determined to go to college and medical school and fulfill her parents\xe2\x80\x99 interrupted dream. In her junior year, Indira began researching college options. She would be a strong applicant. She was consistently at or near the top of her class; she was on the high-school track and soccer teams; she volunteered over 1,000 hours a year at the local hospital, 'b'a record'b' in the history of the teen-volunteer program; and she led her school\xe2\x80\x99s chapter of the Hispanic Organization Promoting Education (HOPE), which encouraged Latino students \xe2\x80\x94 who made up just over half the district\xe2\x80\x99s population \xe2\x80\x94 to stay in school and graduate.'b'She was distressed to discover that Georgia barred undocumented immigrants from attending its top public universities and charged them out-of-state tuition at all others \xe2\x80\x94 triple the rate for citizen residents. She then turned to researching financial aid and learned that Congress barred her from accessing federal Pell grants, loans, scholarships and work-study jobs \xe2\x80\x94 the most common forms of assistance for low-income students. At first, she greeted this as just another set of obstacles to surmount, but as time went on, she began to despair. She would retreat to the classroom of her science teacher, Teresa Leach, who had become her mentor, in need of encouragement. \xe2\x80\x9cThere were a couple of times when I just cried to her because I was tired,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI questioned myself if it was all worth the effort.\xe2\x80\x9d All the while, Indira told me, she held onto her religious conviction that God had a plan, and that she must respect it.'b'At a college fair attended by representatives of numerous Georgia colleges, she asked admissions officers what kind of help was available for undocumented students. No one had any to offer her. She switched her focus to private colleges and was admitted to Atlanta\xe2\x80\x99s Agnes Scott, which she says awarded her $20,000 annually in financial aid, less than half of what she needed. She researched full-ride private scholarships and found two for undocumented students, but she was selected for neither. She was awarded seven small scholarships, which totaled $10,000, enough to go to a nearby public commuter college for only one semester at the out-of-state tuition rate.'b'Last May, Indira attended her graduation ceremony at Gainesville High School, but she had nowhere to go next. In every picture from that day, she wears a wide smile, but she was in pain inside, particularly when she caught a glimpse of her mother in the crowd, looking distraught. Unable to bring herself to celebrate with friends, she went home to be with her family.'b'Days later, a friend told her about a philanthropic organization called TheDream.US, which was offering undocumented students full four-year scholarships to Delaware State University or Eastern Connecticut State University. The application was demanding, and only 76 students would be chosen. She poured herself into the essays, spending hours composing them alongside an English teacher, Cindy Lloyd. She applied to Delaware State, a historically black college in Dover, five hours closer to home than Eastern Connecticut. In late June, she received an email from TheDream.US. \xe2\x80\x9cI saw \xe2\x80\x98Congratulations,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she remembers, \xe2\x80\x9cand I read no more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'In late August, Indira made the 11-hour drive with her parents from Gainesville to Delaware State in unusual silence. She was thinking hard about each of her six younger siblings, wondering how they would fare without her. Over breakfast at a Cracker Barrel in South Carolina, when her mother pressed her about how she was feeling, she talked only of her concerns about not being at home to help everyone. When she arrived on campus \xe2\x80\x94 a flat expanse of grassy courtyards and buildings amid strip malls, auto dealers and chain restaurants just beyond Dover\xe2\x80\x99s historic capital area \xe2\x80\x94 she found 33 other \xe2\x80\x9copportunity scholars,\xe2\x80\x9d just as worried and hopeful as she was. All of them were assigned to a dorm about a quarter of a mile from the D.S.U. campus, a former Sheraton hotel acquired a few years earlier by the university as part of an expansion. They bonded instantly, traveling as a posse from classes to the library to the cafeteria, often ending up together late at night in the dorm lobby or in a lounge that had been a large hotel suite on the second floor.'b'In their first month on campus, the opportunity scholars were invited to 'b'a welcoming ceremony'b' in the school\xe2\x80\x99s Martin Luther King Jr. Student Center with Gov. Jack Markell; the Democratic senator Tom Carper; Donald Graham, a founder of TheDream.US; and D.S.U.\xe2\x80\x99s president, Harry Williams. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is not just an opportunity for you; it is an opportunity for the state of Delaware,\xe2\x80\x9d Markell told them. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is sad to see your own home state reject such talent and potential.\xe2\x80\x9d He pronounced himself \xe2\x80\x9cthrilled that you\xe2\x80\x99re here.\xe2\x80\x9d It was the first time many of the students could recall being welcomed anywhere. \xe2\x80\x9cWe felt rejection our whole lives from our own states,\xe2\x80\x9d Indira said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were here only three weeks, and we already met the governor and the senator. It felt like saying \xe2\x80\x98Haha!\xe2\x80\x99 to Georgia.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'Of the 34 'b'opportunity scholars enrolled at D.S.U., 28 are from Mexico and one each is from Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru, Gabon, Gambia and Trinidad and Tobago. Their families are a composite portrait of the economic forces that have drawn undocumented immigrants to the nation\xe2\x80\x99s small towns and metropolitan heartland. Their parents work in poultry plants, on factory lines, in warehouses, on construction sites, in restaurants; they clean and paint houses and schools, tend gardens. \xe2\x80\x9cThey make everything look perfect for the tourists,\xe2\x80\x9d Yulma Lopez, who left Mexico at age 3, said of her parents\xe2\x80\x99 work for a landscaping company in Charleston, S.C. Almost all their parents work illegally, but many pay income taxes, having obtained federal tax-identification numbers. And some, including Indira\xe2\x80\x99s father, have secured temporary federal permission to work and drive lawfully.'b'While most of the students are 18 or 19, typical for college freshmen, some have worked for years in hopes of one day saving enough for college. Olivia Bekale, who is 27 and grew up in Baton Rouge, arrived in Louisiana from Gabon as a child. She graduated from high school in 2008 with a 3.9 G.P.A. from the Louisiana School for Math, Science and the Arts, a prestigious state-supported boarding school for top achievers. Unable to afford college, she cycled from one low-wage position to the next \xe2\x80\x94 server at the Melting Pot, a fondue restaurant; retail sales consultant for Sprint; customer-service agent for Marriott; pharmacy tech for Walgreens. Olivia, who had wanted to be a doctor since an aunt died of AIDS when she was 5, had been out of high school for eight years when she learned of the opportunity scholarship; she applied immediately.'b'All but one of the students were enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Created in 2012 by an Obama-administration executive action, DACA allowed teenagers and young adults who came to the United States illegally as children with their parents to register with the government and in turn receive a two-year renewable protection against deportation, along with work permits and Social Security numbers. Most of the students, like Indira, signed up at age 15, as soon as they were eligible. With DACA, Indira, who is now 18, was able to get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license and a job at a Publix supermarket when she was in high school, working 20 hours a week as a cashier and bagger. Being able to work and drive legally, free of the fears her mother faced, and fitting in with her classmates, Indira says, was \xe2\x80\x9cliving the American dream.\xe2\x80\x9d With her income from Publix, she even was able to get braces for her teeth.'b'The starting point for all of their dreams was education, and the quest for it has been central to the experience of undocumented young people since long before Indira and her classmates were born. In the late 1970s, when undocumented immigrants had yet to move in large numbers beyond border states, Texas passed a law authorizing local school districts to ban them from public schools or charge them tuition. In a landmark decision in 'b'Plyler v. Doe'b' in 1982, a narrowly divided Supreme Court struck down the law, finding that undocumented children had a constitutional right to free K-through-12 public education. The opinion blamed a dysfunctional immigration system for creating the crisis by failing to keep out undocumented immigrants or provide them a path to citizenship. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready disadvantaged as a result of poverty, lack of English-speaking ability and undeniable racial prejudices, these children, without an education, will become permanently locked into the lowest socioeconomic class,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority, quoting the district-court opinion. The case also introduced the argument that undocumented children were legally blameless, unlike their parents: \xe2\x80\x9cThe classification at issue deprives a group of children of the opportunity for education afforded all other children simply because they have been assigned a legal status due to a violation of law by their parents,\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Lewis Powell wrote in a concurring opinion.'b'Undocumented children poured into the nation\xe2\x80\x99s schools over the next generation, and as they reached college age, they coalesced into a movement, advocating access to higher education as well as full citizenship. In 2001, they began calling themselves Dreamers, now an estimated 2.1 million young immigrants who have grown up as Americans in almost every way except for their passports. The name came from the Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors), introduced in Congress in 2001 by Senator Richard Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican from Utah, and for which activists fought for over a decade. The measure, which would have put undocumented children on a path to citizenship, never passed, but the vast network of Dreamers became a compelling political force.'b'In 2001, hundreds of them turned out to testify in Texas in favor of legislation to allow undocumented residents to pay in-state college tuition if they graduated from Texas high schools and lived in the state for three years. \xe2\x80\x9cSomething magical happened when those kids told their stories,\xe2\x80\x9d says the former Texas state representative Rick Noriega, a Democrat who sponsored the bill. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was a humanizing of a very real issue dealing with children\xe2\x80\x99s dreams and hopes. Every heart on that committee was touched, Republicans and Democrats.\xe2\x80\x9d The legislation passed both houses almost unanimously and was signed by Rick Perry, then governor of Texas and now President Donald Trump\xe2\x80\x99s pick for energy secretary. Texas became the first state, followed quickly by California, to allow Dreamers to pay in-state tuition. Today, 21 states charge Dreamers the same tuition as legal residents, including six carried by Trump \xe2\x80\x94 Florida, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Utah and Texas.'b'In many of those states, however, the once-bipartisan issue has turned politically treacherous. In Texas, efforts to repeal the tuition law come closer to passing every year, and Noriega says there is no chance the original measure would pass today. The leading national opponents of in-state tuition for Dreamers include the Republican senator Jeff Sessions, Trump\xe2\x80\x99s choice for attorney general, and the secretary of state of Kansas, Kris Kobach, a Republican who was a leader of Trump\xe2\x80\x99s transition team on immigration. Each argues that students who are in the United States illegally should not get a public benefit in any state that is denied to a citizen from another state. In other words, if Dreamers pay in-state tuition in Texas, citizen students next door in Arkansas and Oklahoma \xe2\x80\x94 or Massachusetts, for that matter \xe2\x80\x94 should have the same right. \xe2\x80\x9cHow much sense does that make, to have people here illegally, and they have more benefits than those who are here legally?\xe2\x80\x9d Sessions asked in a Senate floor statement. Kobach used the same argument to bring class-action lawsuits against in-state tuition for Dreamers in Kansas and California. Judges found no legal basis for the claims and dismissed the cases.'b'The larger debate over how to treat an estimated 11 million immigrants who came here illegally has been at a stalemate for decades, with advocates seeking a \xe2\x80\x9cpath to citizenship\xe2\x80\x9d for law-abiding families who have been in the country for years and opponents denouncing \xe2\x80\x9camnesty\xe2\x80\x9d for people who broke the law to enter the country. Amid hardening resistance in Congress to immigration reform, Dreamers brought pressure on Obama \xe2\x80\x94 including sit-ins and hunger strikes at his 2012 campaign offices \xe2\x80\x94 to use his executive power to create DACA. The program, announced on June 15, 2012, the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s Plyler decision, proved transformative for Dreamers. They have entered college, taken on-the-books jobs, received driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses, bought cars. They now fly on planes, passing effortlessly through airport security. They still lack legal immigration status, but no longer are they exactly undocumented. \xe2\x80\x9cDACAmented,\xe2\x80\x9d many have called themselves.'b'Even in states where they pay in-state tuition, Dreamers still struggle to afford college because they are disproportionately low-income and have no access to federal financial aid. Fewer than 10 percent of Dreamers who graduate from high school enroll in college. At a time when college graduates earn 70 percent more than those without degrees, these numbers conjure the 1982 warning by the Supreme Court that undocumented children could become a permanent underclass.'b'In response, a handful of philanthropies have adopted the cause of sending students with DACA status to college. The biggest of these, TheDream.US, has raised $90 million to eventually finance 4,000 students at public colleges, with significant contributions from Donald Graham, former publisher and chief executive of The Washington Post, and his family; Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan; Bill and Melinda Gates; the hedge-fund executive William Ackman; and Michael Bloomberg, among others. (I was a reporter at The Washington Post from 1980 to 2008.) In 2014, TheDream.US began offering Dreamers full scholarships in states that charge them in-state tuition. Last year, in partnership with Delaware and Connecticut, the organization created the opportunity-scholarship program for students from the other 29 states, financed by $41 million in philanthropy from Graham and his family and two anonymous donors. The governors of Delaware and Connecticut agreed to charge roughly in-state tuition rates for the 34 scholars at Delaware State and the 42 at Eastern Connecticut State \xe2\x80\x94 a total of $80,000 per student for tuition, room and board for four years. In an effort to pre-empt political opposition, Graham says, the philanthropy works only with schools, like Delaware State and Eastern Connecticut State, that have excess capacity, so that undocumented students are not displacing citizens. And private donors pay all expenses, so that no state dollars are spent.'b'Still, when The Delaware State News ran an article in September about the D.S.U. opportunity scholars, the online comments complained that undocumented immigrants, not citizens, were benefiting. \xe2\x80\x9cTrump isn\xe2\x80\x99t perfect, but I will vote for him because he puts Americans FIRST,\xe2\x80\x9d wrote a reader named John Huff of Magnolia, Del. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are plenty of kids who are citizens who have the same dream and should come first.\xe2\x80\x9d And as news of the scholarship spread on the Delaware campus this fall, a number of African-American students told Dreamers that they resented that their own families had to go into debt for a portion of their education costs while the DACA students got full scholarships.'b'By then, Trump had mobilized anti-immigrant anger in large swaths of the country, having kicked off his campaign criticizing Mexican immigrants \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re bringing drugs. They\xe2\x80\x99re bringing crime. They\xe2\x80\x99re rapists\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 and vowing to build a wall on the border to keep them out. In stump speeches, he promised to deport all 11 million undocumented immigrants and, in his first 100 days in office, to terminate DACA, labeling it \xe2\x80\x9cillegal amnesty.\xe2\x80\x9d Both vows became instant applause lines.'b''b'Indira declared her'b' major in biological sciences at the beginning of the semester and started a demanding pre-med curriculum with six classes, including biology and chemistry, both requiring labs. Her parents had insisted she not take a job, in order to devote herself to education, freeing up four hours a night that she had spent working in high school. With that extra time, she found the academic challenges manageable. Much harder was living apart from her close-knit family for the first time in her life.'b'Her mother texted her daily. \xe2\x80\x9cGood morning, 'b'hija'b',\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote one recent morning, using the Spanish word for daughter. \xe2\x80\x9cMay God bless you today in school. Please be kind to everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d That night, over FaceTime, Indira talked with two of her younger sisters, who like her were born in Mexico and are undocumented. One, a junior in high school, is already on a quest for college scholarships. She and Indira came up with potential essay ideas and discussed her r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9. Then Indira helped the other, a freshman who is the smartest of all the family\xe2\x80\x99s children, Indira says, with physics homework. On weekends, she FaceTimes with her four youngest siblings \xe2\x80\x94 a sixth grader, a fourth grader, a third grader and a first grader \xe2\x80\x94 all of whom were born in Georgia and are citizens.'b'Separation from family, from home, even from Mexican food made most of the opportunity scholars profoundly lonely. Estephany Martinez, a petite criminal-justice major with long black hair, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t stop thinking about her sisters in the first weeks. \xe2\x80\x9cWhenever we came home from school, all four sisters would sit in the living room and do our homework and talk and watch TV,\xe2\x80\x9d she recalled wistfully of her life in Winder, Ga. In Delaware, \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anybody that cared for me. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have anyone to come home to.\xe2\x80\x9d In early September, she summoned all the scholars to a gathering in the dorm\xe2\x80\x99s second-floor lounge. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right, you guys, we\xe2\x80\x99re going to be here for each other,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat part of our lives \xe2\x80\x94 being undocumented \xe2\x80\x94 is critical to who we are. We have to share our stories.\xe2\x80\x9d Everyone crowded in, sitting on the sofa, spilling onto the floor, sitting shoulder to shoulder on counters that once were part of a kitchenette, sprawling into one another\xe2\x80\x99s space.'b'Carlos Gonzales of Manteo, N.C., a lanky and cheerful marketing major whose mother is a restaurant cook, broke down crying when he recalled the violence that drove his family from Mexico City. He, his mother and his younger sister moved to North Carolina when he was 7. It was his mother who encouraged him, beginning in elementary school, to reach for college. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want you to live the life we\xe2\x80\x99re living now,\xe2\x80\x9d she told him. In high school, he was an honor student and varsity wrestler and runner, working nights and weekends at McDonald\xe2\x80\x99s in his Outer Banks town. When he received the email telling him he was an opportunity scholar, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI hugged my mom and cried for two hours. The only reason I stopped was I had to go to work.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indira told the harrowing story that led to her own family\xe2\x80\x99s departure from Mexico. In 2004, when she was 6, three masked gunmen broke into their home, which housed her parents\xe2\x80\x99 clinic, and robbed them of everything \xe2\x80\x94 money, jewelry, a new computer, a television, cameras and medications. They filed a report with the police, they said, who didn\xe2\x80\x99t investigate, in deference to cartels then taking over Guerrero, now the most violent state in Mexico. An uncle of her father\xe2\x80\x99s already had been killed. In subsequent years, a cousin of her mother\xe2\x80\x99s, a veterinarian, was kidnapped and never found. Two nephews disappeared. Her mother\xe2\x80\x99s sister has been kidnapped twice \xe2\x80\x94 most recently this past November \xe2\x80\x94 and returned only after her family paid steep ransoms.'b'Weeks after the robbery, Indira\xe2\x80\x99s family of five arrived in the United States on a tourist visa that her father procured a month earlier in hopes of taking everyone to Disney World. Instead, they went to Gainesville, where her father\xe2\x80\x99s brother worked in construction \xe2\x80\x94 one of thousands of Mexican workers who flocked to the north Georgia community in the last 25 years, swelling the Hispanic population to more than 40 percent in 2013 from 8 percent in 1990. Indira said her parents are certain they would have been killed had they stayed. They decided to forfeit their careers for their family\xe2\x80\x99s safety. \xe2\x80\x9cI no longer saw my future, but I saw my children\xe2\x80\x99s future,\xe2\x80\x9d her father said to me.'b'Antonio Patino, a computer-science major who is a lifeguard and plays bass and guitar in his spare time, told the group about riding with his family in their car in 2015 in Lawrenceville, Ga., when a police officer pulled them over, though none of them understood why. His father, who is undocumented and processes returns for a local manufacturer, was driving but did not have a license. Antonio and his mother, younger sister and brother all watched in terror as his father was handcuffed, placed in a police cruiser and driven off to jail. As it turned out, he was released the next day after paying a fine of more than $800 and was not referred to immigration court for further proceedings, but the incident shook Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s sense of belonging in America. \xe2\x80\x9cI felt like I got slapped in the face just for living, trying to be a normal person in this beautiful country,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like a hole inside me.\xe2\x80\x9d He said he now found himself gripped with fears for his parents\xe2\x80\x99 safety at random moments during his days at D.S.U. It is as if he has swapped roles with his mother and father. \xe2\x80\x9cLike I\xe2\x80\x99m now the parent and they\xe2\x80\x99re the child, and I\xe2\x80\x99m worried for them,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cNot being there, all these what-ifs swarm into my mind. What if out of nowhere they get pulled over again?\xe2\x80\x9d Calling them and hearing their voices usually comforts him. But after one such call, he said: \xe2\x80\x9cI went outside, and I had to cry a little. I was feeling like I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help them.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A number of students shared the enormous sacrifices they had seen their parents make for them. Juan Chavez, 23, who grew up in Plymouth, Ind., and worked for five years after high school, told of his mother suffering a breakdown after her divorce from his father. He saw it as a response to the crushing instability of their lives, moving from one home to another in search of shelter. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s the strongest person I\xe2\x80\x99ll ever know,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cShe\xe2\x80\x99s my role model. My father figure as well as my mother.\xe2\x80\x9d He continued: \xe2\x80\x9cI felt so helpless to make things better. I decided almost right then I\xe2\x80\x99ll go to college and medical school if it takes me the rest of my life.\xe2\x80\x9d He is now a psychology and pre-med major, intending to become a psychiatrist.'b'On and on the students went until almost 3 a.m., the common threads in their stories drawing them closer. It was the first time most of them had talked openly about being undocumented, but instead of feeling exposed, they felt safer. Until then, Antonio had gone out of his way to avoid conversations with non-Dreamers at D.S.U. about his scholarship, not wanting to have to explain that he got it because he was undocumented. The next day, though, he fell into conversation with a student who asked him how he happened to come all the way from Georgia to D.S.U., and he said without hesitation: \xe2\x80\x9cI got a scholarship.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat for?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m undocumented,\xe2\x80\x9d Antonio said, surprised at how comfortable this felt.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K., man, that\xe2\x80\x99s cool,\xe2\x80\x9d the student said.'b'After their long night talking, the scholars also better understood what had propelled them all for as long as they could remember. Throughout high school, the opportunity scholars watched undocumented friends and siblings give up and drop out, shamed and beaten down by public scorn over illegal immigration and the dead-end options awaiting even those who excelled in high school. But they kept on striving, steeled to the insults, positioning themselves for a breakthrough they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t yet see. Now this all made sense. \xe2\x80\x9cThis pain \xe2\x80\x94 it pushes us,\xe2\x80\x9d Estephany said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s motivation. It has made me who I am. It makes me go through every day.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow we know what drives us,\xe2\x80\x9d Indira said.'b''b'One morning in'b' mid-October at 9:50 a.m., 10 minutes before Indira\xe2\x80\x99s analytic-chemistry class was scheduled to start, she and two other opportunity scholars were already ensconced in the three center front-row seats, notebooks, pens and textbooks at the ready. Indira was wearing a Harvard sweatshirt that a classmate bought for her when their high-school A.P.-history class visited Boston. (Indira couldn\xe2\x80\x99t afford to go.) \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to get there one day,\xe2\x80\x9d she said with a confident smile. Most of the other students didn\xe2\x80\x99t arrive until class was about to begin \xe2\x80\x94 or later \xe2\x80\x94 and there was little competition for the front rows.'b'A similar scene unfolded that morning in the ultramodern science center, in computational-thinking class, where Antonio and Jose Reyes Rios, another computer-science major, sat front and center with an African-American classmate named Hanqaamo Lintisio, who is from Maryland and has a track scholarship. The three had formed a study group and tutored one another so effectively that they all scored above 100 on the midterm. (They nailed the bonus question.) Theirs were the only A\xe2\x80\x99s in the class.'b'The Dreamers gather daily at a long Formica table in a D.S.U. cafeteria for food and conversation. At lunch, Carla Moreno propped her English composition textbook, \xe2\x80\x9cPatterns for College Writing,\xe2\x80\x9d against a napkin holder, securing it with an apple. She paged through a chapter while eating her salad and chili dog. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s just a quiz,\xe2\x80\x9d she said, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I want to keep my A.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI deal with a lot of students, and I feel like the Dreamers are at a different level,\xe2\x80\x9d says Kevin Noriega, the adviser for their scholarships. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99re saying, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to make this happen because it\xe2\x80\x99s my only option.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d Of the 488 scholars funded by TheDream.US who began college in 2014, 94 percent remain enrolled after their sophomore year; research shows that only 66 percent of low-income college students nationally return after one year. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is a low-income population with retention rates like Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s,\xe2\x80\x9d Donald Graham says. Because beneficiaries of TheDream.US have full rides, they avoid a common problem faced by other disadvantaged students: running short of money for costs not covered by Pell grants or other forms of aid.'b'One night in October before a biology exam, Indira went to the D.S.U. athletic center for a workout to relieve stress. She was armed with a stack of homemade flash cards and her iPhone, on which she had downloaded discussions of test topics from various websites. While pounding out three miles on the treadmill, she flipped through her study cards, then plugged in her earbuds for a YouTube lecture on glycolysis. Returning to her dorm, she sat down at her desk for a final review. Hanging on the wall in front of her was a collage of family photographs. One showed the whole family of nine around their dinner table. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen I\xe2\x80\x99m struggling, I look at a picture of my mom or dad, and I say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m working for that person,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d she said. That night, her studying complete, she took a last look at her parents\xe2\x80\x99 picture and fell asleep listening to recordings of her biology professor\xe2\x80\x99s lectures. She got an A on the exam.'b'Indira\xe2\x80\x99s determination to become a doctor requires more than a little imagination, because under current law in Georgia and many other states, licenses to practice medicine are reserved for citizens and legal residents. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not planning my life based on the way things are today,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m thinking of the future.\xe2\x80\x9d In her eyes, America is a land of ever-unfolding opportunity. Over Columbus Day weekend, she visited Washington for the first time with her roommate, Karen Baltazar, who is from Lawrenceville, Ga., and also wants to be a doctor. At the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial, Indira stood underneath 'b'Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s Four Freedoms'b' \xe2\x80\x94 freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, freedom from fear \xe2\x80\x94 her arms raised high above her head, as if exulting in the message. Her smile was radiant. Karen snapped a picture, and Indira posted it on her Facebook page along with the caption, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never forgotten the reasons my parents brought me to this great country.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Such unsinkable optimism, which I heard from many D.S.U. Dreamers in the early fall, is hard to maintain, and many of the estimated 65,000 undocumented immigrants who graduate from high school every year \xe2\x80\x94 and thousands who drop out \xe2\x80\x94 simply can\xe2\x80\x99t muster it. In a recent book, \xe2\x80\x9cLives in Limbo,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberto G. Gonzales, an assistant professor at Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s graduate school of education, writes that academically successful Dreamers are far outnumbered by those who become casualties of \xe2\x80\x9cthe deeper and more far-reaching consequences of being undocumented: living in poverty, having parents and family members who also bear the burdens of being undocumented, watching friends moving forward but being unable to join them, watching opportunities pass you by, navigating a world of exclusions while constantly looking over your shoulder.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'At least some of the opportunity scholars\xe2\x80\x99 optimism last fall came from their assumption, based on reported polls, that Hillary Clinton would be the next president. They were heartened by her speeches about keeping families together and pursuing comprehensive immigration reform. At the very least, they were confident that DACA would remain in effect under her leadership. Though they didn\xe2\x80\x99t believe Trump could win, he unnerved them with his speeches branding Mexicans criminals who stole Americans\xe2\x80\x99 jobs and lived off their tax dollars. They took this rhetoric as a personal affront and were horrified by the hatred they saw on the faces of those who cheered his words. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only thing that depresses me is so many people support him,\xe2\x80\x9d Jose Reyes Rios, the computer-science major, who aspires to work at Google one day, said in late September.'b'On election night, a group of Dreamers gathered around the flat-screen TV in the dorm lobby, many of them studying as they watched returns. Indira had exams the next day in math and biology and arrived equipped with her flash cards. The mood turned dark after Trump won Florida. Everyone\xe2\x80\x99s mind flooded with his vows that they had discounted until now \xe2\x80\x94 to revoke DACA, to deputize local police departments to enforce federal immigration laws. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will issue detainers for all illegal immigrants who are arrested for any crime whatsoever, and they will be placed into immediate removal proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d Trump said last summer in Arizona. As all of them knew well, these crimes included one of their parents\xe2\x80\x99 daily activities \xe2\x80\x94 driving without a license. If DACA disappeared, and with it their Social Security numbers, their own driver\xe2\x80\x99s licenses would be worthless. So would their federal work authorization, meaning most would lose the jobs that paid for their books, phones, clothes, travel home and anything else they needed.'b'By 1 a.m., Indira became too distressed to concentrate. Olivia Bekale was one of four opportunity scholars who watched until Trump was declared the president-elect. \xe2\x80\x9cWe were just looking at each other and crying,\xe2\x80\x9d she says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe hugged each other and went to our rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'On the Sunday'b' after the election, when they gathered in the dorm lobby, the opportunity scholars were struggling with something unfamiliar: despair. They had registered for DACA with the Department of Homeland Security, which now knew exactly where they were. \xe2\x80\x9cLife is going to be like it is for our parents,\xe2\x80\x9d said Victor Hernandez of Coats, N.C., stunned and shaking his head. \xe2\x80\x9cThey could come pick us up and take us away any time.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Social media brought aftershocks for all of them as they discovered that many of their best friends voted for Trump. Almost all of Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s high-school swim teammates in Lawrenceville had Trump filters on their Facebook and Snapchat profile pictures. \xe2\x80\x9cAll I could think was: You voted against me,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat did I do to you?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The day after the election, Indira couldn\xe2\x80\x99t bear to call her mother until the afternoon. Instead, she confided her fears in text messages to her former science teacher, Teresa Leach. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never been so disappointed in this country,\xe2\x80\x9d she wrote. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never felt so powerless. ... I\xe2\x80\x99m scared about my family, my mom. ... Not sure if I\xe2\x80\x99ll even get my degree, much less go to medical school here.\xe2\x80\x9d When Indira finally did call home, her mother insisted she was not afraid and told Indira that education was now even more important.'b'Several of Indira\xe2\x80\x99s friends back home told her they doubted Trump would follow through on all his campaign promises, and in any case, they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine he would target her. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are people who helped me get to where I am, who remind me they love me, and I love them,\xe2\x80\x9d she said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut they\xe2\x80\x99ll never understand what we feel. They say, \xe2\x80\x98He won\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x99 Do they think he\xe2\x80\x99s going to send back all the immigrants except Indira?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A lifeline of sorts arrived the week after the election, when the students received letters from TheDream.US, Governor Markell and the president of D.S.U., pledging to stand behind their scholarships no matter what became of DACA. Donald Graham lined up attorneys to represent them if anyone challenged their right to be in school.'b'But their bigger fears were for their parents. Antonio and Indira went home for Christmas to find their families filled with trepidation. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re trying to be invisible, trying to stay hidden,\xe2\x80\x9d Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s father said, \xe2\x80\x9cdo only the things we have to do to live, like go to work, go buy groceries.\xe2\x80\x9d During the 2015 holiday season, they took a driving tour of the Christmas lights and celebrated New Year\xe2\x80\x99s Eve in downtown Lawrenceville. \xe2\x80\x9cNow we can\xe2\x80\x99t go to any festivities because for us it\xe2\x80\x99s very dangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d his mother told me in their apartment in a complex in Buford, Ga. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are a lot of police there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Antonio\xe2\x80\x99s father said he worries about driving his daughter, Litzy, 15, home from her swim-team practice at rush hour, when the police presence increases. Litzy was born in Georgia, and he thought of asking her to leave the team until she is old enough to drive because, as a citizen, she will be able to get a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license. \xe2\x80\x9cBut then I said to myself: \xe2\x80\x98No! That\xe2\x80\x99s crazy. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re here \xe2\x80\x94 for our kids. So they can take advantage of every opportunity.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d He continues to ferry her \xe2\x80\x94 carefully \xe2\x80\x94 during rush hour.'b'Indira found her mother more frightened than at any time since receiving her deportation order. Her mother says she has no choice but to drive when someone at her church asks for help, when her children call for rides home and when she is needed at a charity medical clinic where she volunteers as a doctor\xe2\x80\x99s assistant and translator. \xe2\x80\x9cLife changed after the election,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me in December, in her living room decorated with framed academic awards for each child. She was surrounded by her kids, who listened carefully. \xe2\x80\x9cThe children know I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license. They know at any time maybe the police will take me again. \xe2\x80\x98If I can\xe2\x80\x99t come back,\xe2\x80\x99 I tell them, \xe2\x80\x98you have to go to school every day. You have to study hard \xe2\x80\x94 even harder.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b'By the time'b' Indira and the other opportunity scholars returned to campus in January, all of them had come to the same conclusion: There was now only one thing they could control \xe2\x80\x94 their education. \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way we can fight back is to excel in school,\xe2\x80\x9d Indira wrote to me in a text message. She felt weary in the aftermath of the election, but when she had this epiphany, she said: \xe2\x80\x9cI wasn\xe2\x80\x99t tired anymore. I had that drive, that hunger to just come out on top. I was angry. I was staying at the library longer, going to the gym a lot more.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Estephany Martinez focused on her life\xe2\x80\x99s mission. \xe2\x80\x9cMy goal is being a police chief \xe2\x80\x94 something that makes my voice louder,\xe2\x80\x9d said the criminal-justice major. \xe2\x80\x9cI have to educate myself to get there. I want to show people who don\xe2\x80\x99t believe in us: \xe2\x80\x98I got all the way here. I\xe2\x80\x99m starting from the bottom with education, and I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get there.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'As they settled into the semester, they monitored everything Trump and his close allies were saying about immigration, their moods shifting with each utterance. Back in December, they felt hopeful when Trump, in his interview as Time Magazine\xe2\x80\x99s Person of the Year, said approving things about Dreamers and indicated that he would deport serious criminals before other undocumented immigrants. They were discouraged in January when Jeff Sessions, in his confirmation hearing to become attorney general, appeared unconcerned about the consequences of revoking DACA. They took heart two days later when Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, said in a CNN town-hall meeting that he wanted Congress to pass legislation making Dreamers \xe2\x80\x9cright with the law.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Indira and other Georgia scholars were exhilarated in early January when 'b'a state court ordered'b' the Board of Regents to allow DACA holders to pay in-state tuition. But their hopes collapsed when a state appeals court 'b'stayed the decision'b'; Trump appeared likely to revoke DACA before Georgia Dreamers could reap the benefits. \xe2\x80\x9cI said: \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99ll happen next, but we\xe2\x80\x99re here in this place, and the only way we can win is to succeed in our education,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d Indira told me.'b'Soon after classes started, the opportunity scholars learned that their collective grade point average for the first semester was a 3.76. Six of the 34 students had achieved a perfect 4.0. Indira was one of them. \xe2\x80\x9cSucceeding for me is how I can get my revenge,\xe2\x80\x9d she told me over the phone, interrupting her biology homework for a few minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to break the stereotype of us being here taking jobs away and not helping the economy. I want Trump to see we\xe2\x80\x99re the total opposite of what he thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''b'Over the past two years of writing this column about immigrants and their food, I\xe2\x80\x99ve cooked with a Filipina nurse who used scalpels to debone chicken; a Senegalese family that eats out of the same dish to emphasize everyone\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to one another; a Mexican Popsicle maker who tried to heal the ache of her divorce by sharing literal sweetness. There was a Slovakian pierogi master whose last act before leaving for the United States was opening the barn doors to set her animals free; a Polish vegetarian who learned to make 'b'bigos'b', a meatfest of a stew, just so she could share her mother\xe2\x80\x99s recipe; and a Palestinian family that lives the American dream by hosting a Thanksgiving every night.'b'As a writer, I wrote this column feeling honored to be entrusted with their stories. And as the child of Chinese immigrants, I wrote this column looking up to my subjects \xe2\x80\x94 as I do to my own parents \xe2\x80\x94 for carrying the burden of living between two worlds. For finding their footing while having to bridge where they\xe2\x80\x99re from with where they are.'b'I\xe2\x80\x99ve been thinking about this because this is my last column for the magazine \xe2\x80\x94 another dream project beckons, which I hope you\xe2\x80\x99ll hear more about soon \xe2\x80\x94 but also because of tomatoes and eggs.'b'A few weeks ago, I felt a sudden, irresistible craving for Chinese stir-fried tomatoes and eggs. A dish of savory, sweet-tart tomato sauce folded around soft-scrambled eggs, it hits every pleasure center in the brain and makes it easy to scarf down a lot of rice, fast. When I worked in Chinatown, it was a staple of every $4 buffet in the neighborhood. A version of it with beef was my younger brother\xe2\x80\x99s favorite food when we were growing up, and by \xe2\x80\x9cfavorite food,\xe2\x80\x9d I mean it was basically the only thing he would eat for the first eight years of his life. (So much so that once, for some reason clear only to jerk older brothers, I squirted ketchup into his apple juice to make fun of him. We fought, he won, I drank the juice.)'b'It\xe2\x80\x99s the kind of dish that people say is the first thing they learned to cook, that fed them when they left home, that inspires sudden and irresistible cravings. But when my hunger struck, I had no idea how to make it. I looked in my Chinese cookbooks, but it appeared in exactly none of them. Calling up my mother to ask her, I knew, would be like asking her to describe how to tie shoelaces: almost impossible to articulate, buried so deep in her muscle memory. In Chinese cooking, this dish is like air, present and invisible.'b'I knew that I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to figure out a recipe for it, because I realized that my not knowing how to make this dish was akin to my Cantonese getting rusty, to not knowing when Chinese New Year is every year. It\xe2\x80\x99s because I\xe2\x80\x99m not an immigrant, only a son of immigrants, and so I know only the frayed facsimile of the world that my parents grew up in. Being part of a culture without living in it is like being in a long-distance relationship. You can make it work with grand displays of affection and splendid visits, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t get to have coffee together on a Sunday morning \xe2\x80\x94 the little things, the stuff daily life is built on. I knew that if I were to have this recipe, it would have to come to me through my people or not at all.'b'So I went online and found recipe after recipe, with an eye toward cobbling together my own. I read the cookbook author Genevieve Ko\xe2\x80\x99s version and took from it the idea of just lightly cooking the eggs before finishing them in the tomatoes. I read Chichi Wang\xe2\x80\x99s version, on Serious Eats, and lifted her brilliant use of fragrant rice wine in the eggs and ketchup in the sauce. I read dozens of blog posts, mostly relating the same story over and over again \xe2\x80\x94 a story of nostalgia, of Mom\xe2\x80\x99s cooking, of home. I read the comments, also telling the same: Thank you, thank you, I\xe2\x80\x99ve missed this dish, thank you, thank you. And after all this reading, I started to realize what I was really seeing: people, just like me, missing a knowledge that they felt should be in their bones, coming to someone else\xe2\x80\x99s recipes to connect them to where they came from while being rooted in where they are.'b''b'Recipe: 'b''b'Chinese Stir-Fried Tomatoes and Eggs'b''b''b''b''b''b'Late one Friday night in early November, Jun Rekimoto, a distinguished professor of human-computer interaction at the University of Tokyo, was online preparing for a lecture when he began to notice some peculiar posts rolling in on social media. Apparently Google Translate, the company\xe2\x80\x99s popular machine-translation service, had suddenly and almost immeasurably improved. Rekimoto visited Translate himself and began to experiment with it. He was astonished. He had to go to sleep, but Translate refused to relax its grip on his imagination.'b'Rekimoto wrote up his initial findings in a blog post. First, he compared a few sentences from two published versions of \xe2\x80\x9cThe Great Gatsby,\xe2\x80\x9d Takashi Nozaki\xe2\x80\x99s 1957 translation and Haruki Murakami\xe2\x80\x99s more recent iteration, with what this new Google Translate was able to produce. Murakami\xe2\x80\x99s translation is written \xe2\x80\x9cin very polished Japanese,\xe2\x80\x9d Rekimoto explained to me later via email, but the prose is distinctively \xe2\x80\x9cMurakami-style.\xe2\x80\x9d By contrast, Google\xe2\x80\x99s translation \xe2\x80\x94 despite some \xe2\x80\x9csmall unnaturalness\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 reads to him as \xe2\x80\x9cmore transparent.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The second half of Rekimoto\xe2\x80\x99s post examined the service in the other direction, from Japanese to English. He dashed off his own Japanese interpretation of the opening to Hemingway\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cThe Snows of Kilimanjaro,\xe2\x80\x9d then ran that passage back through Google into English. He published this version alongside Hemingway\xe2\x80\x99s original, and proceeded to invite his readers to guess which was the work of a machine.'b'NO. 1:'b'NO. 2:'b'Even to a native English speaker, the missing article on the leopard is the only real giveaway that No. 2 was the output of an automaton. Their closeness was a source of wonder to Rekimoto, who was well acquainted with the capabilities of the previous service. Only 24 hours earlier, Google would have translated the same Japanese passage as follows:'b'Rekimoto promoted his discovery to his hundred thousand or so followers on Twitter, and over the next few hours thousands of people broadcast their own experiments with the machine-translation service. Some were successful, others meant mostly for comic effect. As dawn broke over Tokyo, Google Translate was the No. 1 trend on Japanese Twitter, just above some cult anime series and the long-awaited new single from a girl-idol supergroup. Everybody wondered: How had Google Translate become so uncannily artful?'b''b'Four days later,'b' a couple of hundred journalists, entrepreneurs and advertisers from all over the world gathered in Google\xe2\x80\x99s London engineering office for a special announcement. Guests were greeted with Translate-branded fortune cookies. Their paper slips had a foreign phrase on one side \xe2\x80\x94 mine was in Norwegian \xe2\x80\x94 and on the other, an invitation to download the Translate app. Tables were set with trays of doughnuts and smoothies, each labeled with a placard that advertised its flavor in German ('b'zitrone'b'), Portuguese ('b'baunilha'b') or Spanish ('b'manzana'b'). After a while, everyone was ushered into a plush, dark theater.'b'Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, stood to make a few opening remarks. A friend, he began, had recently told him he reminded him of Google. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy, because I know all the answers?\xe2\x80\x9d the mayor asked. \xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d the friend replied, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause you\xe2\x80\x99re always trying to finish my sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d The crowd tittered politely. Khan concluded by introducing Google\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, who took the stage.'b'Pichai was in London in part to inaugurate Google\xe2\x80\x99s new building there, the cornerstone of a new \xe2\x80\x9cknowledge quarter\xe2\x80\x9d under construction at King\xe2\x80\x99s Cross, and in part to unveil the completion of the initial phase of a company transformation he announced last year. The Google of the future, Pichai had said on several occasions, was going to be \xe2\x80\x9cA.I. first.\xe2\x80\x9d What that meant in theory was complicated and had welcomed much speculation. What it meant in practice, with any luck, was that soon the company\xe2\x80\x99s products would no longer represent the fruits of traditional computer programming, exactly, but \xe2\x80\x9cmachine learning.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A rarefied department within the company, Google Brain, was founded five years ago on this very principle: that artificial \xe2\x80\x9cneural networks\xe2\x80\x9d that acquaint themselves with the world via trial and error, as toddlers do, might in turn develop something like human flexibility. This notion is not new \xe2\x80\x94 a version of it dates to the earliest stages of modern computing, in the 1940s \xe2\x80\x94 but for much of its history most computer scientists saw it as vaguely disreputable, even mystical. Since 2011, though, Google Brain has demonstrated that this approach to artificial intelligence could solve many problems that confounded decades of conventional efforts. Speech recognition didn\xe2\x80\x99t work very well until Brain undertook an effort to revamp it; the application of machine learning made its performance on Google\xe2\x80\x99s mobile platform, Android, almost as good as human transcription. The same was true of image recognition. Less than a year ago, Brain for the first time commenced with the gut renovation of an entire consumer product, and its momentous results were being celebrated tonight.'b'Translate made its debut in 2006 and since then has become one of Google\xe2\x80\x99s most reliable and popular assets; it serves more than 500 million monthly users in need of 140 billion words per day in a different language. It exists not only as its own stand-alone app but also as an integrated feature within Gmail, Chrome and many other Google offerings, where we take it as a push-button given \xe2\x80\x94 a frictionless, natural part of our digital commerce. It was only with the refugee crisis, Pichai explained from the lectern, that the company came to reckon with Translate\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical importance: On the screen behind him appeared a graph whose steep curve indicated a recent fivefold increase in translations between Arabic and German. (It was also close to Pichai\xe2\x80\x99s own heart. He grew up in India, a land divided by dozens of languages.) The team had been steadily adding new languages and features, but gains in quality over the last four years had slowed considerably.'b'Until today. As of the previous weekend, Translate had been converted to an A.I.-based system for much of its traffic, not just in the United States but in Europe and Asia as well: The rollout included translations between English and Spanish, French, Portuguese, German, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. The rest of Translate\xe2\x80\x99s hundred-odd languages were to come, with the aim of eight per month, by the end of next year. The new incarnation, to the pleasant surprise of Google\xe2\x80\x99s own engineers, had been completed in only nine months. The A.I. system had demonstrated overnight improvements roughly equal to the total gains the old one had accrued over its entire lifetime.'b'Pichai has an affection for the obscure literary reference; he told me a month earlier, in his office in Mountain View, Calif., that Translate in part exists because not everyone can be like the physicist Robert Oppenheimer, who learned Sanskrit to read the Bhagavad Gita in the original. In London, the slide on the monitors behind him flicked to a Borges quote: \xe2\x80\x9c'b'Uno no es lo que es por lo que escribe, sino por lo que ha le\xc3\xaddo'b'.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Grinning, Pichai read aloud an awkward English version of the sentence that had been rendered by the old Translate system: \xe2\x80\x9cOne is not what is for what he writes, but for what he has read.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'To the right of that was a new A.I.-rendered version: \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not what you write, but what you have read.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was a fitting remark: The new Google Translate was run on the first machines that had, in a sense, ever learned to read anything at all.'b''b'Google\xe2\x80\x99s decision'b' to reorganize itself around A.I. was the first major manifestation of what has become an industrywide machine-learning delirium. Over the past four years, six companies in particular \xe2\x80\x94 Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and the Chinese firm Baidu \xe2\x80\x94 have touched off an arms race for A.I. talent, particularly within universities. Corporate promises of resources and freedom have thinned out top academic departments. It has become widely known in Silicon Valley that Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, personally oversees, with phone calls and video-chat blandishments, his company\xe2\x80\x99s overtures to the most desirable graduate students. Starting salaries of seven figures are not unheard-of. Attendance at the field\xe2\x80\x99s most important academic conference has nearly quadrupled. What is at stake is not just one more piecemeal innovation but control over what very well could represent an entirely new computational platform: pervasive, ambient artificial intelligence.'b'The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cartificial intelligence\xe2\x80\x9d is invoked as if its meaning were self-evident, but it has always been a source of confusion and controversy. Imagine if you went back to the 1970s, stopped someone on the street, pulled out a smartphone and showed her Google Maps. Once you managed to convince her you weren\xe2\x80\x99t some oddly dressed wizard, and that what you withdrew from your pocket wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a black-arts amulet but merely a tiny computer more powerful than the one that guided Apollo missions, Google Maps would almost certainly seem to her a persuasive example of \xe2\x80\x9cartificial intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d In a very real sense, it is. It can do things any map-literate human can manage, like get you from your hotel to the airport \xe2\x80\x94 though it can do so much more quickly and reliably. It can also do things that humans simply and obviously cannot: It can evaluate the traffic, plan the best route and reorient itself when you take the wrong exit.'b'Practically nobody today, however, would bestow upon Google Maps the honorific \xe2\x80\x9cA.I.,\xe2\x80\x9d so sentimental and sparing are we in our use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cintelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d Artificial intelligence, we believe, must be something that distinguishes HAL from whatever it is a loom or wheelbarrow can do. The minute we can automate a task, we downgrade the relevant skill involved to one of mere mechanism. Today Google Maps seems, in the pejorative sense of the term, robotic: It simply accepts an explicit demand (the need to get from one place to another) and tries to satisfy that demand as efficiently as possible. The goal posts for \xe2\x80\x9cartificial intelligence\xe2\x80\x9d are thus constantly receding.'b'When he has an opportunity to make careful distinctions, Pichai differentiates between the current applications of A.I. and the ultimate goal of \xe2\x80\x9cartificial 'b'general'b' intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d Artificial general intelligence will not involve dutiful adherence to explicit instructions, but instead will demonstrate a facility with the implicit, the interpretive. It will be a general tool, designed for general purposes in a general context. Pichai believes his company\xe2\x80\x99s future depends on something like this. Imagine if you could tell Google Maps, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d like to go to the airport, but I need to stop off on the way to buy a present for my nephew.\xe2\x80\x9d A more generally intelligent version of that service \xe2\x80\x94 a ubiquitous assistant, of the sort that Scarlett Johansson memorably disembodied three years ago in the Spike Jonze film \xe2\x80\x9cHer\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94 would know all sorts of things that, say, a close friend or an earnest intern might know: your nephew\xe2\x80\x99s age, and how much you ordinarily like to spend on gifts for children, and where to find an open store. But a truly intelligent Maps could also conceivably know all sorts of things a close friend wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t, like what has only recently come into fashion among preschoolers in your nephew\xe2\x80\x99s school \xe2\x80\x94 or more important, what its users actually want. If an intelligent machine were able to discern some intricate if murky regularity in data about what we have done in the past, it might be able to extrapolate about our subsequent desires, even if we don\xe2\x80\x99t entirely know them ourselves.'b'The new wave of A.I.-enhanced assistants \xe2\x80\x94 Apple\xe2\x80\x99s Siri, Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s M, Amazon\xe2\x80\x99s Echo \xe2\x80\x94 are all creatures of machine learning, built with similar intentions. The corporate dreams for machine learning, however, aren\xe2\x80\x99t exhausted by the goal of consumer clairvoyance. A medical-imaging subsidiary of Samsung announced this year that its new ultrasound devices could detect breast cancer. Management consultants are falling all over themselves to prep executives for the widening industrial applications of computers that program themselves. DeepMind, a 2014 Google acquisition, defeated the reigning human grandmaster of the ancient board game Go, despite predictions that such an achievement would take another 10 years.'b'In a famous 'b'1950 essay'b', Alan Turing proposed a test for an artificial general intelligence: a computer that could, over the course of five minutes of text exchange, successfully deceive a real human interlocutor. Once a machine can translate fluently between two natural languages, the foundation has been laid for a machine that might one day \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d human language well enough to engage in plausible conversation. Google Brain\xe2\x80\x99s members, who pushed and helped oversee the Translate project, believe that such a machine would be on its way to serving as a generally intelligent all-encompassing personal digital assistant.'b''b'What follows here 'b'is the story of how a team of Google researchers and engineers \xe2\x80\x94 at first one or two, then three or four, and finally more than a hundred \xe2\x80\x94 made considerable progress in that direction. It\xe2\x80\x99s an uncommon story in many ways, not least of all because it defies many of the Silicon Valley stereotypes we\xe2\x80\x99ve grown accustomed to. It does not feature people who think that everything will be unrecognizably different tomorrow or the next day because of some restless tinkerer in his garage. It is neither a story about people who think technology will solve all our problems nor one about people who think technology is ineluctably bound to create apocalyptic new ones. It is not about disruption, at least not in the way that word tends to be used.'b'It is, in fact, three overlapping stories that converge in Google Translate\xe2\x80\x99s successful metamorphosis to A.I. \xe2\x80\x94 a technical story, an institutional story and a story about the evolution of ideas. The technical story is about one team on one product at one company, and the process by which they refined, tested and introduced a brand-new version of an old product in only about a quarter of the time anyone, themselves included, might reasonably have expected. The institutional story is about the employees of a small but influential artificial-intelligence group within that company, and the process by which their intuitive faith in some old, unproven and broadly unpalatable notions about computing upended every other company within a large radius. The story of ideas is about the cognitive scientists, psychologists and wayward engineers who long toiled in obscurity, and the process by which their ostensibly irrational convictions ultimately inspired a paradigm shift in our understanding not only of technology but also, in theory, of consciousness itself.'b'The first story, the story of Google Translate, takes place in Mountain View over nine months, and it explains the transformation of machine translation. The second story, the story of Google Brain and its many competitors, takes place in Silicon Valley over five years, and it explains the transformation of that entire community. The third story, the story of deep learning, takes place in a variety of far-flung laboratories \xe2\x80\x94 in Scotland, Switzerland, Japan and most of all Canada \xe2\x80\x94 over seven decades, and it might very well contribute to the revision of our self-image as first and foremost beings who think.'b'All three are stories about artificial intelligence. The seven-decade story is about what we might conceivably expect or want from it. The five-year story is about what it might do in the near future. The nine-month story is about what it can do right this minute. These three stories are themselves just proof of concept. All of this is only the beginning.'b'Jeff Dean, though his title is senior fellow, is the de facto head of Google Brain. Dean is a sinewy, energy-efficient man with a long, narrow face, deep-set eyes and an earnest, soapbox-derby sort of enthusiasm. The son of a medical anthropologist and a public-health epidemiologist, Dean grew up all over the world \xe2\x80\x94 Minnesota, Hawaii, Boston, Arkansas, Geneva, Uganda, Somalia, Atlanta \xe2\x80\x94 and, while in high school and college, wrote software used by the World Health Organization. He has been with Google since 1999, as employee 25ish, and has had a hand in the core software systems beneath nearly every significant undertaking since then. A beloved artifact of company culture is 'b'Jeff Dean Facts'b', written in the style of the Chuck Norris Facts meme: \xe2\x80\x9cJeff Dean\xe2\x80\x99s PIN is the last four digits of pi.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, he saw a missed call from Jeff Dean.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cJeff Dean got promoted to Level 11 in a system where the maximum level is 10.\xe2\x80\x9d (This last one is, in fact, true.)'b'One day in early 2011, Dean walked into one of the Google campus\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmicrokitchens\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the \xe2\x80\x9cGoogley\xe2\x80\x9d word for the shared break spaces on most floors of the Mountain View complex\xe2\x80\x99s buildings \xe2\x80\x94 and ran into Andrew Ng, a young Stanford computer-science professor who was working for the company as a consultant. Ng told him about Project Marvin, an internal effort (named after the celebrated A.I. pioneer Marvin Minsky) he had recently helped establish to experiment with \xe2\x80\x9cneural networks,\xe2\x80\x9d pliant digital lattices based loosely on the architecture of the brain. Dean himself had worked on a primitive version of the technology as an undergraduate at the University of Minnesota in 1990, during one of the method\xe2\x80\x99s brief windows of mainstream acceptability. Now, over the previous five years, the number of academics working on neural networks had begun to grow again, from a handful to a few dozen. Ng told Dean that Project Marvin, which was being underwritten by Google\xe2\x80\x99s secretive X lab, had already achieved some promising results.'b'Dean was intrigued enough to lend his \xe2\x80\x9c20 percent\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 the portion of work hours every Google employee is expected to contribute to programs outside his or her core job \xe2\x80\x94 to the project. Pretty soon, he suggested to Ng that they bring in another colleague with a neuroscience background, Greg Corrado. (In graduate school, Corrado was taught briefly about the technology, but strictly as a historical curiosity. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was good I was paying attention in class that day,\xe2\x80\x9d he joked to me.) In late spring they brought in one of Ng\xe2\x80\x99s best graduate students, Quoc Le, as the project\xe2\x80\x99s first intern. By then, a number of the Google engineers had taken to referring to Project Marvin by another name: Google Brain.'b'Since the term \xe2\x80\x9cartificial intelligence\xe2\x80\x9d was first coined, at a kind of constitutional convention of the mind at Dartmouth in the summer of 1956, a majority of researchers have long thought the best approach to creating A.I. would be to write a very big, comprehensive program that laid out both the rules of logical reasoning and sufficient knowledge of the world. If you wanted to translate from English to Japanese, for example, you would program into the computer all of the grammatical rules of English, and 'b'then'b' the entirety of definitions contained in the Oxford English Dictionary, and 'b'then'b' all of the grammatical rules of Japanese, as well as all of the words in the Japanese dictionary, and 'b'only after all of that 'b'feed it a sentence in a source language and ask it to tabulate a corresponding sentence in the target language. You would give the machine a language map that was, as Borges would have had it, the size of the territory. This perspective is usually called \xe2\x80\x9csymbolic A.I.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 because its definition of cognition is based on symbolic logic \xe2\x80\x94 or, disparagingly, \xe2\x80\x9cgood old-fashioned A.I.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There are two main problems with the old-fashioned approach. The first is that it\xe2\x80\x99s awfully time-consuming on the human end. The second is that it only really works in domains where rules and definitions are very clear: in mathematics, for example, or chess. Translation, however, is an example of a field where this approach fails horribly, because words cannot be reduced to their dictionary definitions, and because languages tend to have as many exceptions as they have rules. More often than not, a system like this is liable to translate \xe2\x80\x9cminister of agriculture\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cpriest of farming.\xe2\x80\x9d Still, for math and chess it worked great, and the proponents of symbolic A.I. took it for granted that no activities signaled \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral intelligence\xe2\x80\x9d better than math and chess.'b'There were, however, limits to what this system could do. In the 1980s, a robotics researcher at Carnegie Mellon pointed out that it was easy to get computers to do adult things but nearly impossible to get them to do things a 1-year-old could do, like hold a ball or identify a cat. By the 1990s, despite punishing advancements in computer chess, we still weren\xe2\x80\x99t remotely close to artificial general intelligence.'b'There has always been another vision for A.I. \xe2\x80\x94 a dissenting view \xe2\x80\x94 in which the computers would learn from the ground up (from data) rather than from the top down (from rules). This notion dates to the early 1940s, when it occurred to researchers that the best model for flexible automated intelligence was the brain itself. A brain, after all, is just a bunch of widgets, called neurons, that either pass along an electrical charge to their neighbors or don\xe2\x80\x99t. What\xe2\x80\x99s important are less the individual neurons themselves than the manifold connections among them. This structure, in its simplicity, has afforded the brain a wealth of adaptive advantages. The brain can operate in circumstances in which information is poor or missing; it can withstand significant damage without total loss of control; it can store a huge amount of knowledge in a very efficient way; it can isolate distinct patterns but retain the messiness necessary to handle ambiguity.'b'There was no reason you couldn\xe2\x80\x99t try to mimic this structure in electronic form, and in 1943 'b'it was shown'b' that arrangements of simple 'b'artificial'b' neurons could carry out basic logical functions. They could also, at least in theory, learn the way we do. With life experience, depending on a particular person\xe2\x80\x99s trials and errors, the synaptic connections among pairs of neurons get stronger or weaker. An artificial neural network could do something similar, by gradually altering, on a guided trial-and-error basis, the numerical relationships among artificial neurons. It wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be preprogrammed with fixed rules. It would, instead, rewire itself to reflect patterns in the data it absorbed.'b'This attitude toward artificial intelligence was evolutionary rather than creationist. If you wanted a flexible mechanism, you wanted one that could adapt to its environment. If you wanted something that could adapt, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to begin with the indoctrination of the rules of chess. You wanted to begin with very basic abilities \xe2\x80\x94 sensory perception and motor control \xe2\x80\x94 in the hope that advanced skills would emerge organically. Humans don\xe2\x80\x99t learn to understand language by memorizing dictionaries and grammar books, so why should we possibly expect our computers to do so?'b'Google Brain was the first major commercial institution to invest in the possibilities embodied by this way of thinking about A.I. Dean, Corrado and Ng began their work as a part-time, collaborative experiment, but they made immediate progress. They took architectural inspiration for their models from recent theoretical outlines \xe2\x80\x94 as well as ideas that had been on the shelf since the 1980s and 1990s \xe2\x80\x94 and drew upon both the company\xe2\x80\x99s peerless reserves of data and its massive computing infrastructure. They instructed the networks on enormous banks of \xe2\x80\x9clabeled\xe2\x80\x9d data \xe2\x80\x94 speech files with correct transcriptions, for example \xe2\x80\x94 and the computers improved their responses to better match reality.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe portion of evolution in which animals developed eyes was a big development,\xe2\x80\x9d Dean told me one day, with customary understatement. We were sitting, as usual, in a whiteboarded meeting room, on which he had drawn a crowded, snaking timeline of Google Brain and its relation to inflection points in the recent history of neural networks. \xe2\x80\x9cNow computers have eyes. We can build them around the capabilities that now exist to understand photos. Robots will be drastically transformed. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to operate in an unknown environment, on much different problems.\xe2\x80\x9d These capacities they were building may have seemed primitive, but their implications were profound.'b'In its first year or so of existence, Brain\xe2\x80\x99s experiments in the development of a machine with the talents of a 1-year-old had, as Dean said, worked to great effect. Its speech-recognition team swapped out part of their old system for a neural network and encountered, in pretty much one fell swoop, the best quality improvements anyone had seen in 20 years. Their system\xe2\x80\x99s object-recognition abilities improved by an order of magnitude. This was not because Brain\xe2\x80\x99s personnel had generated a sheaf of outrageous new ideas in just a year. It was because Google had finally devoted the resources \xe2\x80\x94 in computers and, increasingly, personnel \xe2\x80\x94 to fill in outlines that had been around for a long time.'b''b'A great preponderance of these extant and neglected notions had been proposed or refined by a peripatetic English polymath named Geoffrey Hinton. In the second year of Brain\xe2\x80\x99s existence, Hinton was recruited to Brain as Andrew Ng left. (Ng now leads the 1,300-person A.I. team at Baidu.) Hinton wanted to leave his post at the University of Toronto for only three months, so for arcane contractual reasons he had to be hired as an intern. At intern training, the orientation leader would say something like, \xe2\x80\x9cType in your LDAP\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a user login \xe2\x80\x94 and he would flag a helper to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s an LDAP?\xe2\x80\x9d All the smart 25-year-olds in attendance, who had only ever known deep learning as the sine qua non of artificial intelligence, snickered: \xe2\x80\x9cWho is that old guy? Why doesn\xe2\x80\x99t he get it?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt lunchtime,\xe2\x80\x9d Hinton said, \xe2\x80\x9csomeone in the queue yelled: \xe2\x80\x98Professor Hinton! I took your course! What are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x99 After that, it was all right.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A few months later, Hinton and two of his students 'b'demonstrated'b' truly astonishing gains in a big image-recognition contest, run by an open-source collective called ImageNet, that asks computers not only to identify a monkey but also to distinguish between spider monkeys and howler monkeys, and among God knows how many different breeds of cat. Google soon approached Hinton and his students with an offer. They accepted. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought they were interested in our I.P.,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cTurns out they were interested in us.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hinton comes from one of those old British families emblazoned like the Darwins at eccentric angles across the intellectual landscape, where regardless of titular preoccupation a person is expected to make sideline contributions to minor problems in astronomy or fluid dynamics. His great-great-grandfather was George Boole, whose foundational work in symbolic logic underpins the computer; another great-great-grandfather was a celebrated surgeon, his father a venturesome entomologist, his father\xe2\x80\x99s cousin a Los Alamos researcher; the list goes on. He trained at Cambridge and Edinburgh, then taught at Carnegie Mellon before he ended up at Toronto, where he still spends half his time. (His work has long been supported by the largess of the Canadian government.) I visited him in his office at Google there. He has tousled yellowed-pewter hair combed forward in a mature Noel Gallagher style and wore a baggy striped dress shirt that persisted in coming untucked, and oval eyeglasses that slid down to the tip of a prominent nose. He speaks with a driving if shambolic wit, and says things like, \xe2\x80\x9cComputers will understand sarcasm before Americans do.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hinton had been working on neural networks since his undergraduate days at Cambridge in the late 1960s, and he is seen as the intellectual primogenitor of the contemporary field. For most of that time, whenever he spoke about machine learning, people looked at him as though he were talking about the Ptolemaic spheres or bloodletting by leeches. Neural networks were taken as a disproven folly, largely on the basis of one overhyped project: the Perceptron, an artificial neural network that Frank Rosenblatt, a Cornell psychologist, developed in the late 1950s. The New York Times reported that the machine\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor, the United States Navy, expected it would \xe2\x80\x9cbe able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\xe2\x80\x9d It went on to do approximately none of those things. Marvin Minsky, the dean of artificial intelligence in America, had worked on neural networks for his 1954 Princeton thesis, but he\xe2\x80\x99d since grown tired of the inflated claims that Rosenblatt \xe2\x80\x94 who was a contemporary at Bronx Science \xe2\x80\x94 made for the neural paradigm. (He was also competing for Defense Department funding.) Along with an M.I.T. colleague, Minsky published a book that proved that there were painfully simple problems the Perceptron could never solve.'b'Minsky\xe2\x80\x99s criticism of the Perceptron extended only to networks of one \xe2\x80\x9clayer,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., one layer of artificial neurons between what\xe2\x80\x99s fed to the machine and what you expect from it \xe2\x80\x94 and later in life, he expounded ideas very similar to contemporary deep learning. But Hinton already knew at the time that complex tasks could be carried out if you had recourse to multiple layers. The simplest description of a neural network is that it\xe2\x80\x99s a machine that makes classifications or predictions based on its ability to discover patterns in data. With one layer, you could find only simple patterns; with more than one, you could look for patterns of patterns. Take the case of image recognition, which tends to rely on a contraption called a \xe2\x80\x9cconvolutional neural net.\xe2\x80\x9d (These were elaborated in a 'b'seminal 1998 paper'b' whose lead author, a Frenchman named Yann LeCun, did his postdoctoral research in Toronto under Hinton and now directs a huge A.I. endeavor at Facebook.) The first layer of the network learns to identify the very basic visual trope of an \xe2\x80\x9cedge,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning a 'b'nothing'b' (an off-pixel) followed by a 'b'something'b' (an on-pixel) or vice versa. Each successive layer of the network looks for a pattern in the previous layer. A pattern of edges might be a circle or a rectangle. A pattern of circles or rectangles might be a face. And so on. This more or less parallels the way information is put together in increasingly abstract ways as it travels from the photoreceptors in the retina back and up through the visual cortex. At each conceptual step, detail that isn\xe2\x80\x99t immediately relevant is thrown away. If several edges and circles come together to make a face, you don\xe2\x80\x99t care exactly where the face is found in the visual field; you just care that it\xe2\x80\x99s a face.'b'The issue with multilayered, \xe2\x80\x9cdeep\xe2\x80\x9d neural networks was that the trial-and-error part got extraordinarily complicated. In a single layer, it\xe2\x80\x99s easy. Imagine that you\xe2\x80\x99re playing with a child. You tell the child, \xe2\x80\x9cPick up the green ball and put it into Box A.\xe2\x80\x9d The child picks up a green ball and puts it into Box B. You say, \xe2\x80\x9cTry again to put the green ball in Box A.\xe2\x80\x9d The child tries Box A. Bravo.'b'Now imagine you tell the child, \xe2\x80\x9cPick up a green ball, go through the door marked 3 and put the green ball into Box A.\xe2\x80\x9d The child takes a red ball, goes through the door marked 2 and puts the red ball into Box B. How do you begin to correct the child? You cannot just repeat your initial instructions, because the child does not know at which point he went wrong. In real life, you might start by holding up the red ball and the green ball and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cRed ball, green ball.\xe2\x80\x9d The whole point of machine learning, however, is to avoid that kind of explicit mentoring. Hinton and a few others went on to 'b'invent a solution'b' (or rather, reinvent 'b'an older one'b') to this layered-error problem, over the halting course of the late 1970s and 1980s, and interest among computer scientists in neural networks was briefly revived. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople got very excited about it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we oversold it.\xe2\x80\x9d Computer scientists quickly went back to thinking that people like Hinton were weirdos and mystics.'b'These ideas remained popular, however, among philosophers and psychologists, who called it \xe2\x80\x9cconnectionism\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparallel distributed processing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cThis idea,\xe2\x80\x9d Hinton told me, \xe2\x80\x9cof a few people keeping a torch burning, it\xe2\x80\x99s a nice myth. It was true within artificial intelligence. But within psychology lots of people believed in the approach but just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9d Neither could Hinton, despite the generosity of the Canadian government. \xe2\x80\x9cThere just wasn\xe2\x80\x99t enough computer power or enough data. People on our side kept saying, \xe2\x80\x98Yeah, but if I had a really big one, it would work.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89It wasn\xe2\x80\x99t a very persuasive argument.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'When Pichai said that Google would henceforth be \xe2\x80\x9cA.I. first,\xe2\x80\x9d he was not just making a claim about his company\xe2\x80\x99s business strategy; he was throwing in his company\xe2\x80\x99s lot with this long-unworkable idea. Pichai\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of resources ensured that people like Dean could ensure that people like Hinton would have, at long last, enough computers and enough data to make a persuasive argument. An average brain has something on the order of 100 billion neurons. Each neuron is connected to up to 10,000 other neurons, which means that the number of synapses is between 100 trillion and 1,000 trillion. For a simple artificial neural network of the sort proposed in the 1940s, the attempt to even try to replicate this was unimaginable. We\xe2\x80\x99re still far from the construction of a network of that size, but Google Brain\xe2\x80\x99s investment allowed for the creation of artificial neural networks comparable to the brains of mice.'b''b'To understand why scale is so important, however, you have to start to understand some of the more technical details of what, exactly, machine intelligences are doing with the data they consume. A lot of our ambient fears about A.I. rest on the idea that they\xe2\x80\x99re just vacuuming up knowledge like a sociopathic prodigy in a library, and that an artificial intelligence constructed to make paper clips might someday decide to treat humans like ants or lettuce. This just isn\xe2\x80\x99t how they work. All they\xe2\x80\x99re doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities \xe2\x80\x94 basic patterns, at first, and then more complex ones \xe2\x80\x94 and for the moment, at least, the greatest danger is that the information we\xe2\x80\x99re feeding them is biased in the first place.'b'If that brief explanation seems sufficiently reassuring, the reassured nontechnical reader is invited to skip forward to the next section, which is about cats. If not, then read on. (This section is also, luckily, about cats.)'b'Imagine you want to program a cat-recognizer on the old symbolic-A.I. model. You stay up for days preloading the machine with an exhaustive, explicit definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccat.\xe2\x80\x9d You tell it that a cat has four legs and pointy ears and whiskers and a tail, and so on. All this information is stored in a special place in memory called Cat. Now you show it a picture. First, the machine has to separate out the various distinct elements of the image. Then it has to take these elements and apply the rules stored in its memory. If(legs=4) and if(ears=pointy) and if(whiskers=yes) and if(tail=yes) and if(expression=supercilious), then(cat=yes). But what if you showed this cat-recognizer a Scottish Fold, a heart-rending breed with a prized genetic defect that leads to droopy doubled-over ears? Our symbolic A.I. gets to (ears=pointy) and shakes its head solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cNot cat.\xe2\x80\x9d It is hyperliteral, or \xe2\x80\x9cbrittle.\xe2\x80\x9d Even the thickest toddler shows much greater inferential acuity.'b'Now imagine that instead of hard-wiring the machine with a set of rules for classification stored in one location of the computer\xe2\x80\x99s memory, you try the same thing on a neural network. There is no special place that can hold the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccat.\xe2\x80\x9d There is just a giant blob of interconnected switches, like forks in a path. On one side of the blob, you present the inputs (the pictures); on the other side, you present the corresponding outputs (the labels). Then you just tell it to work out 'b'for itself,'b' via the individual calibration of all of these interconnected switches, whatever path the data should take so that the inputs are mapped to the correct outputs. The training is the process by which a labyrinthine series of elaborate tunnels are excavated through the blob, tunnels that connect any given input to its proper output. The more training data you have, the greater the number and intricacy of the tunnels that can be dug. Once the training is complete, the middle of the blob has enough tunnels that it can make reliable predictions about how to handle data it has never seen before. This is called \xe2\x80\x9csupervised learning.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The reason that the network requires so many neurons and so much data is that it functions, in a way, like a sort of giant machine democracy. Imagine you want to train a computer to differentiate among five different items. Your network is made up of millions and millions of neuronal \xe2\x80\x9cvoters,\xe2\x80\x9d each of whom has been given five different cards: one for cat, one for dog, one for spider monkey, one for spoon and one for defibrillator. You show your electorate a photo and ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs this a cat, a dog, a spider monkey, a spoon or a defibrillator?\xe2\x80\x9d All the neurons that voted the same way collect in groups, and the network foreman peers down from above and identifies the majority classification: \xe2\x80\x9cA dog?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'You say: \xe2\x80\x9cNo, maestro, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cat. Try again.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Now the network foreman goes back to identify which voters threw their weight behind \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x9d and which didn\xe2\x80\x99t. The ones that got \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x9d right get their votes counted double next time \xe2\x80\x94 at least when they\xe2\x80\x99re voting for \xe2\x80\x9ccat.\xe2\x80\x9d They have to prove independently whether they\xe2\x80\x99re also good at picking out dogs and defibrillators, but one thing that makes a neural network so flexible is that each individual unit can contribute differently to different desired outcomes. What\xe2\x80\x99s important is not the individual vote, exactly, but the pattern of votes. If Joe, Frank and Mary all vote together, it\xe2\x80\x99s a dog; but if Joe, Kate and Jessica vote together, it\xe2\x80\x99s a cat; and if Kate, Jessica and Frank vote together, it\xe2\x80\x99s a defibrillator. The neural network just needs to register enough of a regularly discernible signal somewhere to say, \xe2\x80\x9cOdds are, this particular arrangement of pixels represents something these humans keep calling \xe2\x80\x98cats.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d The more \xe2\x80\x9cvoters\xe2\x80\x9d you have, and the more times you make them vote, the more keenly the network can register even very weak signals. If you have only Joe, Frank and Mary, you can maybe use them only to differentiate among a cat, a dog and a defibrillator. If you have millions of different voters that can associate in billions of different ways, you can learn to classify data with incredible granularity. Your trained voter assembly will be able to look at an unlabeled picture and identify it more or less accurately.'b'Part of the reason there was so much resistance to these ideas in computer-science departments is that because the output is just a prediction based on patterns of patterns, it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to be perfect, and the machine will never be able to define for you what, exactly, a cat is. It just knows them when it sees them. This wooliness, however, is the point. The neuronal \xe2\x80\x9cvoters\xe2\x80\x9d will recognize a happy cat dozing in the sun and an angry cat glaring out from the shadows of an untidy litter box, as long as they have been exposed to millions of diverse cat scenes. You just need lots and lots of the voters \xe2\x80\x94 in order to make sure that 'b'some'b' part of your network picks up on even very weak regularities, on Scottish Folds with droopy ears, for example \xe2\x80\x94 and enough labeled data to make sure your network has seen the widest possible variance in phenomena.'b'It is important to note, however, that the fact that neural networks are probabilistic in nature means that they\xe2\x80\x99re not suitable for all tasks. It\xe2\x80\x99s no great tragedy if they mislabel 1 percent of cats as dogs, or send you to the wrong movie on occasion, but in something like a self-driving car we all want greater assurances. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t the only caveat. Supervised learning is a trial-and-error process based on 'b'labeled'b' data. The machines might be doing the learning, but there remains a strong human element in the initial categorization of the inputs. If your data had a picture of a man and a woman in suits that someone had labeled \xe2\x80\x9cwoman with her boss,\xe2\x80\x9d that relationship would be encoded into all future pattern recognition. Labeled data is thus fallible the way that human labelers are fallible. If a machine was asked to identify creditworthy candidates for loans, it might use data like felony convictions, but if felony convictions were unfair in the first place \xe2\x80\x94 if they were based on, say, discriminatory drug laws \xe2\x80\x94 then the loan recommendations would perforce also be fallible.'b'Image-recognition networks like our cat-identifier are only one of many varieties of deep learning, but they are disproportionately invoked as teaching examples because each layer does something at least vaguely recognizable to humans \xe2\x80\x94 picking out edges first, then circles, then faces. This means there\xe2\x80\x99s a safeguard against error. For instance, an early oddity in Google\xe2\x80\x99s image-recognition software meant that it could not always identify a barbell in isolation, even though the team had trained it on an image set that included a lot of exercise categories. A visualization tool showed them the machine had learned not the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cdumbbell\xe2\x80\x9d but the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cdumbbell+arm,\xe2\x80\x9d because all the dumbbells in the training set were attached to arms. They threw into the training mix some photos of solo barbells. The problem was solved. Not everything is so easy.'b'Over the course of its first year or two, Brain\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to cultivate in machines the skills of a 1-year-old were auspicious enough that the team was graduated out of the X lab and into the broader research organization. (The head of Google X once noted that Brain had paid for the entirety of X\xe2\x80\x99s costs.) They still had fewer than 10 people and only a vague sense for what might ultimately come of it all. But even then they were thinking ahead to what ought to happen next. First a human mind learns to recognize a ball and rests easily with the accomplishment for a moment, but sooner or later, it wants to ask for the ball. And then it wades into language.'b'The first step in that direction was 'b'the cat paper'b', which made Brain famous.'b'What the cat paper demonstrated was that a neural network with more than a billion \xe2\x80\x9csynaptic\xe2\x80\x9d connections \xe2\x80\x94 a hundred times larger than any publicized neural network to that point, yet still many orders of magnitude smaller than our brains \xe2\x80\x94 could observe raw, unlabeled data and pick out for itself a high-order human concept. The Brain researchers had shown the network millions of still frames from YouTube videos, and out of the welter of the pure sensorium the network had isolated a stable pattern any toddler or chipmunk would recognize without a moment\xe2\x80\x99s hesitation as the face of a cat. The machine had not been programmed with the foreknowledge of a cat; it reached directly into the world and seized the idea for itself. (The researchers discovered this with the neural-network equivalent of something like an M.R.I., which showed them that a ghostly cat face caused the artificial neurons to \xe2\x80\x9cvote\xe2\x80\x9d with the greatest collective enthusiasm.) Most machine learning to that point had been limited by the quantities of labeled data. The cat paper showed that machines could also deal with raw 'b'unlabeled'b' data, perhaps even data of which humans had no established foreknowledge. This seemed like a major advance not only in cat-recognition studies but also in overall artificial intelligence.'b'The lead author on the cat paper was Quoc Le. Le is short and willowy and soft-spoken, with a quick, enigmatic smile and shiny black penny loafers. He grew up outside Hue, Vietnam. His parents were rice farmers, and he did not have electricity at home. His mathematical abilities were obvious from an early age, and he was sent to study at a magnet school for science. In the late 1990s, while still in school, he tried to build a chatbot to talk to. He thought, How hard could this be?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut actually,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me in a whispery deadpan, \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s very hard.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He left the rice paddies on a scholarship to a university in Canberra, Australia, where he worked on A.I. tasks like computer vision. The dominant method of the time, which involved feeding the machine definitions for things like edges, felt to him like cheating. Le didn\xe2\x80\x99t know then, or knew only dimly, that there were at least a few dozen computer scientists elsewhere in the world who couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help imagining, as he did, that machines could learn from scratch. In 2006, Le took a position at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in the medieval German university town of T\xc3\xbcbingen. In a reading group there, he encountered 'b'two new'b' 'b'papers'b' by Geoffrey Hinton. People who entered the discipline during the long diaspora all have conversion stories, and when Le read those papers, he felt the scales fall away from his eyes.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere was a big debate,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me. \xe2\x80\x9cA very big debate.\xe2\x80\x9d We were in a small interior conference room, a narrow, high-ceilinged space outfitted with only a small table and two whiteboards. He looked to the curve he\xe2\x80\x99d drawn on the whiteboard behind him and back again, then softly confided, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen such a big debate.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He remembers standing up at the reading group and saying, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the future.\xe2\x80\x9d It was, he said, an \xe2\x80\x9cunpopular decision at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d A former adviser from Australia, with whom he had stayed close, couldn\xe2\x80\x99t quite understand Le\xe2\x80\x99s decision. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy are you doing this?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Le in an email.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a good answer back then,\xe2\x80\x9d Le said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was just curious. There was a successful paradigm, but to be honest I was just curious about the new paradigm. In 2006, there was very little activity.\xe2\x80\x9d He went to join Ng at Stanford and began to pursue Hinton\xe2\x80\x99s ideas. \xe2\x80\x9cBy the end of 2010, I was pretty convinced something was going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'What happened, soon afterward, was that Le went to Brain as its first intern, where he carried on with his dissertation work \xe2\x80\x94 an extension of which ultimately became the cat paper. On a simple level, Le wanted to see if the computer could be trained to identify on its own the information that was absolutely essential to a given image. He fed the neural network a still he had taken from YouTube. He then told the neural network to throw away some of the information contained in the image, though he didn\xe2\x80\x99t specify what it should or shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t throw away. The machine threw away some of the information, initially at random. Then he said: \xe2\x80\x9cJust kidding! Now recreate the initial image you were shown based only on the information you retained.\xe2\x80\x9d It was as if he were asking the machine to find a way to \xe2\x80\x9csummarize\xe2\x80\x9d the image, and then expand back to the original from the summary. If the summary was based on irrelevant data \xe2\x80\x94 like the color of the sky rather than the presence of whiskers \xe2\x80\x94 the machine couldn\xe2\x80\x99t perform a competent reconstruction. Its reaction would be akin to that of a distant ancestor whose takeaway from his brief exposure to saber-tooth tigers was that they made a restful swooshing sound when they moved. Le\xe2\x80\x99s neural network, unlike that ancestor, got to try again, and again and again and again. Each time it mathematically \xe2\x80\x9cchose\xe2\x80\x9d to prioritize different pieces of information and performed incrementally better. A neural network, however, was a black box. It divined patterns, but the patterns it identified didn\xe2\x80\x99t always make intuitive sense to a human observer. The same network that hit on our concept of cat also became enthusiastic about a pattern that looked like some sort of furniture-animal compound, like a cross between an ottoman and a goat.'b'Le didn\xe2\x80\x99t see himself in those heady cat years as a language guy, but he felt an urge to connect the dots to his early chatbot. After the cat paper, he realized that if you could ask a network to summarize a photo, you could perhaps also ask it to summarize a sentence. This problem preoccupied Le, along with a Brain colleague named Tomas Mikolov, for the next two years.'b'In that time, the Brain team outgrew several offices around him. For a while they were on a floor they shared with executives. They got an email at one point from the administrator asking that they please stop allowing people to sleep on the couch in front of Larry Page and Sergey Brin\xe2\x80\x99s suite. It unsettled incoming V.I.P.s. They were then allocated part of a research building across the street, where their exchanges in the microkitchen wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be squandered on polite chitchat with the suits. That interim also saw dedicated attempts on the part of Google\xe2\x80\x99s competitors to catch up. (As Le told me about his close collaboration with Tomas Mikolov, he kept repeating Mikolov\xe2\x80\x99s name over and over, in an incantatory way that sounded poignant. Le had never seemed so solemn. I finally couldn\xe2\x80\x99t help myself and began to ask, \xe2\x80\x9cIs he ... ?\xe2\x80\x9d Le nodded. \xe2\x80\x9cAt Facebook,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied.)'b'They spent this period trying to come up with neural-network architectures that could accommodate not only simple photo classifications, which were static, but also complex structures that unfolded over time, like language or music. Many of these were first 'b'proposed in the 1990s'b', and Le and his colleagues went back to those long-ignored contributions to see what they could glean. They knew that once you established a facility with basic linguistic prediction, you could then go on to do all sorts of other intelligent things \xe2\x80\x94 like predict a suitable reply to an email, for example, or predict the flow of a sensible conversation. You could sidle up to the sort of prowess that would, from the outside at least, look a lot like thinking.'b'The hundred or so current members of Brain \xe2\x80\x94 it often feels less like a department within a colossal corporate hierarchy than it does a club or a scholastic society or an intergalactic cantina \xe2\x80\x94 came in the intervening years to count among the freest and most widely admired employees in the entire Google organization. They are now quartered in a tiered two-story eggshell building, with large windows tinted a menacing charcoal gray, on the leafy northwestern fringe of the company\xe2\x80\x99s main Mountain View campus. Their microkitchen has a foosball table I never saw used; a Rock Band setup I never saw used; and a Go kit I saw used on a few occasions. (I did once see a young Brain research associate introducing his colleagues to ripe jackfruit, carving up the enormous spiky orb like a turkey.)'b'When I began spending time at Brain\xe2\x80\x99s offices, in June, there were some rows of empty desks, but most of them were labeled with Post-it notes that said things like \xe2\x80\x9cJesse, 6/27.\xe2\x80\x9d Now those are all occupied. When I first visited, parking was not an issue. The closest spaces were those reserved for expectant mothers or Teslas, but there was ample space in the rest of the lot. By October, if I showed up later than 9:30, I had to find a spot across the street.'b'Brain\xe2\x80\x99s growth made Dean slightly nervous about how the company was going to handle the demand. He wanted to avoid what at Google is known as a \xe2\x80\x9csuccess disaster\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 a situation in which the company\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities in theory outpaced its ability to implement a product in practice. At a certain point he did some back-of-the-envelope calculations, which he presented to the executives one day in a two-slide presentation.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf everyone in the future speaks to their Android phone for three minutes a day,\xe2\x80\x9d he told them, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is how many machines we\xe2\x80\x99ll need.\xe2\x80\x9d They would need to double or triple their global computational footprint.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed with a little theatrical gulp and widened eyes, \xe2\x80\x9csounded scary. You\xe2\x80\x99d have to\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he hesitated to imagine the consequences \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cbuild new buildings.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'There was, however, another option: just design, mass-produce and install in dispersed data centers a new kind of chip to make everything faster. These chips would be called T.P.U.s, or \xe2\x80\x9ctensor processing units,\xe2\x80\x9d and their value proposition \xe2\x80\x94 counterintuitively \xe2\x80\x94 is that they are deliberately less precise than normal chips. Rather than compute 12.246 times 54.392, they will give you the perfunctory answer to 12 times 54. On a mathematical level, rather than a metaphorical one, a neural network is just a structured series of hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of matrix multiplications carried out in succession, and it\xe2\x80\x99s much more important that these processes be fast than that they be exact. \xe2\x80\x9cNormally,\xe2\x80\x9d Dean said, \xe2\x80\x9cspecial-purpose hardware is a bad idea. It usually works to speed up one thing. But because of the generality of neural networks, you can leverage this special-purpose hardware for a lot of other things.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Just as the chip-design process was nearly complete, Le and two colleagues finally demonstrated that neural networks might be configured to handle the structure of language. He drew upon an idea, called \xe2\x80\x9cword embeddings,\xe2\x80\x9d that had been 'b'around for more than 10 years'b'. When you summarize images, you can divine a picture of what each stage of the summary looks like \xe2\x80\x94 an edge, a circle, etc. When you summarize language in a similar way, you essentially produce multidimensional maps of the distances, based on common usage, between one word and every single other word in the language. The machine is not \xe2\x80\x9canalyzing\xe2\x80\x9d the data the way that we might, with linguistic rules that identify some of them as nouns and others as verbs. Instead, it is shifting and twisting and warping the words around in the map. In two dimensions, you cannot make this map useful. You want, for example, \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x9d to be in the rough vicinity of \xe2\x80\x9cdog,\xe2\x80\x9d but you also want \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x9d to be near \xe2\x80\x9ctail\xe2\x80\x9d and near \xe2\x80\x9csupercilious\xe2\x80\x9d and near \xe2\x80\x9cmeme,\xe2\x80\x9d because you want to try to capture all of the different relationships \xe2\x80\x94 both strong and weak \xe2\x80\x94 that the word \xe2\x80\x9ccat\xe2\x80\x9d has to other words. It can be related to all these other words simultaneously only if it is related to each of them in a different dimension. You can\xe2\x80\x99t easily make a 160,000-dimensional map, but it turns out you can represent a language pretty well in a mere thousand or so dimensions \xe2\x80\x94 in other words, a universe in which each word is designated by a list of a thousand numbers. Le gave me a good-natured hard time for my continual requests for a mental picture of these maps. \xe2\x80\x9cGideon,\xe2\x80\x9d he would say, with the blunt regular demurral of Bartleby, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not generally like trying to visualize thousand-dimensional vectors in three-dimensional space.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Still, certain dimensions in the space, it turned out, did seem to represent legible human categories, like gender or relative size. If you took the thousand numbers that meant \xe2\x80\x9cking\xe2\x80\x9d and literally just 'b'subtracted'b' the thousand numbers that meant \xe2\x80\x9cqueen,\xe2\x80\x9d you got the same numerical result as if you subtracted the numbers for \xe2\x80\x9cwoman\xe2\x80\x9d from the numbers for \xe2\x80\x9cman.\xe2\x80\x9d And if you took the entire space of the English language and the entire space of French, you could, at least in theory, train a network to learn how to take a sentence in one space and propose an equivalent in the other. You just had to give it millions and millions of English sentences as inputs on one side and their desired French outputs on the other, and over time it would recognize the relevant patterns in words the way that an image classifier recognized the relevant patterns in pixels. You could then give it a sentence in English and ask it to predict the best French analogue.'b'The major difference between words and pixels, however, is that all of the pixels in an image are there at once, whereas words appear in a progression over time. You needed a way for the network to \xe2\x80\x9chold in mind\xe2\x80\x9d the progression of a chronological sequence \xe2\x80\x94 the complete pathway from the first word to the last. In a period of about a week, in September 2014, three papers came out \xe2\x80\x94 'b'one by Le'b' and two others by academics in 'b'Canada'b' and 'b'Germany'b' \xe2\x80\x94 that at last provided all the theoretical tools necessary to do this sort of thing. That research allowed for open-ended projects like Brain\xe2\x80\x99s Magenta, an investigation into how machines might generate art and music. It also cleared the way toward an instrumental task like machine translation. Hinton told me he thought at the time that this follow-up work would take at least five more years.'b'Le\xe2\x80\x99s paper showed that neural translation was plausible, but he had used only a relatively small public data set. (Small for Google, that is \xe2\x80\x94 it was actually the biggest public data set in the world. A decade of the old Translate had gathered production data that was between a hundred and a thousand times bigger.) More important, Le\xe2\x80\x99s model didn\xe2\x80\x99t work very well for sentences longer than about seven words.'b'Mike Schuster, who then was a staff research scientist at Brain, picked up the baton. He knew that if Google didn\xe2\x80\x99t find a way to scale these theoretical insights up to a production level, someone else would. The project took him the next two years. \xe2\x80\x9cYou think,\xe2\x80\x9d Schuster says, \xe2\x80\x9cto translate something, you just get the data, run the experiments and you\xe2\x80\x99re done, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t work like that.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Schuster is a taut, focused, ageless being with a tanned, piston-shaped head, narrow shoulders, long camo cargo shorts tied below the knee and neon-green Nike Flyknits. He looks as if he woke up in the lotus position, reached for his small, rimless, elliptical glasses, accepted calories in the form of a modest portion of preserved acorn and completed a relaxed desert decathlon on the way to the office; in reality, he told me, it\xe2\x80\x99s only an 18-mile bike ride each way. Schuster grew up in Duisburg, in the former West Germany\xe2\x80\x99s blast-furnace district, and studied electrical engineering before moving to Kyoto to work on early neural networks. In the 1990s, he ran experiments with a neural-networking machine as big as a conference room; it cost millions of dollars and had to be trained for weeks to do something you could now do on your desktop in less than an hour. He published 'b'a paper in 1997'b' that was barely cited for a decade and a half; this year it has been cited around 150 times. He is not humorless, but he does often wear an expression of some asperity, which I took as his signature combination of German restraint and Japanese restraint.'b'The issues Schuster had to deal with were tangled. For one thing, Le\xe2\x80\x99s code was custom-written, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t compatible with the new open-source machine-learning platform Google was then developing, TensorFlow. Dean directed to Schuster two other engineers, Yonghui Wu and Zhifeng Chen, in the fall of 2015. It took them two months just to replicate Le\xe2\x80\x99s results on the new system. Le was around, but even he couldn\xe2\x80\x99t always make heads or tails of what they had done.'b'As Schuster put it, \xe2\x80\x9cSome of the stuff was not done in full consciousness. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t know themselves why they worked.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This February, Google\xe2\x80\x99s research organization \xe2\x80\x94 the loose division of the company, roughly a thousand employees in all, dedicated to the forward-looking and the unclassifiable \xe2\x80\x94 convened their leads at an offsite retreat at the Westin St. Francis, on Union Square, a luxury hotel slightly less splendid than Google\xe2\x80\x99s own San Francisco shop a mile or so to the east. The morning was reserved for rounds of \xe2\x80\x9clightning talks,\xe2\x80\x9d quick updates to cover the research waterfront, and the afternoon was idled away in cross-departmental \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitated discussions.\xe2\x80\x9d The hope was that the retreat might provide an occasion for the unpredictable, oblique, Bell Labs-ish exchanges that kept a mature company prolific.'b'At lunchtime, Corrado and Dean paired up in search of Macduff Hughes, director of Google Translate. Hughes was eating alone, and the two Brain members took positions at either side. As Corrado put it, \xe2\x80\x9cWe ambushed him.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO.K.,\xe2\x80\x9d Corrado said to the wary Hughes, holding his breath for effect. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have something to tell you.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'They told Hughes that 2016 seemed like a good time to consider an overhaul of Google Translate \xe2\x80\x94 the code of hundreds of engineers over 10 years \xe2\x80\x94 with a neural network. The old system worked the way all machine translation has worked for about 30 years: It sequestered each successive sentence fragment, looked up those words in a large statistically derived vocabulary table, then applied a battery of post-processing rules to affix proper endings and rearrange it all to make sense. The approach is called \xe2\x80\x9cphrase-based statistical machine translation,\xe2\x80\x9d because by the time the system gets to the next phrase, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know what the last one was. This is why Translate\xe2\x80\x99s output sometimes looked like a shaken bag of fridge magnets. Brain\xe2\x80\x99s replacement would, if it came together, read and render entire sentences at one draft. It would capture context \xe2\x80\x94 and something akin to meaning.'b'The stakes may have seemed low: Translate generates minimal revenue, and it probably always will. For most Anglophone users, even a radical upgrade in the service\xe2\x80\x99s performance would hardly be hailed as anything more than an expected incremental bump. But there was a case to be made that human-quality machine translation is not only a short-term necessity but also a development very likely, in the long term, to prove transformational. In the immediate future, it\xe2\x80\x99s vital to the company\xe2\x80\x99s business strategy. Google estimates that 50 percent of the internet is in English, which perhaps 20 percent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population speaks. If Google was going to compete in China \xe2\x80\x94 where a majority of market share in search-engine traffic belonged to its competitor Baidu \xe2\x80\x94 or India, decent machine translation would be an indispensable part of the infrastructure. Baidu itself had published a 'b'pathbreaking paper'b' about the possibility of neural machine translation in July 2015.'b'And in the more distant, speculative future, machine translation was perhaps the first step toward a general computational facility with human language. This would represent a major inflection point \xe2\x80\x94 perhaps 'b'the'b' major inflection point \xe2\x80\x94 in the development of something that felt like true artificial intelligence.'b'Most people in Silicon Valley were aware of machine learning as a fast-approaching horizon, so Hughes had seen this ambush coming. He remained skeptical. A modest, sturdily built man of early middle age with mussed auburn hair graying at the temples, Hughes is a classic line engineer, the sort of craftsman who wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been out of place at a drafting table at 1970s Boeing. His jeans pockets often look burdened with curious tools of ungainly dimension, as if he were porting around measuring tapes or thermocouples, and unlike many of the younger people who work for him, he has a wardrobe unreliant on company gear. He knew that various people in various places at Google and elsewhere had been trying to make neural translation work \xe2\x80\x94 not in a lab but at production scale \xe2\x80\x94 for years, to little avail.'b'Hughes listened to their case and, at the end, said cautiously that it sounded to him as if maybe they could pull it off in three years.'b'Dean thought otherwise. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can do it by the end of the year, if we put our minds to it.\xe2\x80\x9d One reason people liked and admired Dean so much was that he had a long record of successfully putting his mind to it. Another was that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t at all embarrassed to say sincere things like \xe2\x80\x9cif we put our minds to it.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Hughes was sure the conversion wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to happen any time soon, but he didn\xe2\x80\x99t personally care to be the reason. \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s prepare for 2016,\xe2\x80\x9d he went back and told his team. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to be the one to say Jeff Dean can\xe2\x80\x99t deliver speed.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'A month later, they were finally able to run a side-by-side experiment to compare Schuster\xe2\x80\x99s new system with Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s old one. Schuster wanted to run it for English-French, but Hughes advised him to try something else. \xe2\x80\x9cEnglish-French,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cis so good that the improvement won\xe2\x80\x99t be obvious.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'It was a challenge Schuster couldn\xe2\x80\x99t resist. The benchmark metric to evaluate machine translation is called a BLEU score, which compares a machine translation with an average of many reliable human translations. At the time, the best BLEU scores for English-French were in the high 20s. An improvement of one point was considered very good; an improvement of two was considered outstanding.'b'The neural system, on the English-French language pair, showed an improvement over the old system of seven points.'b'Hughes told Schuster\xe2\x80\x99s team they hadn\xe2\x80\x99t had even half as strong an improvement in their own system in the last four years.'b'To be sure this wasn\xe2\x80\x99t some fluke in the metric, they also turned to their pool of human contractors to do a side-by-side comparison. The user-perception scores, in which sample sentences were graded from zero to six, showed an average improvement of 0.4 \xe2\x80\x94 roughly equivalent to the aggregate gains of the old system over its entire lifetime of development.'b'In mid-March, Hughes sent his team an email. All projects on the old system were to be suspended immediately.'b'Until then, the neural-translation team had been only three people \xe2\x80\x94 Schuster, Wu and Chen \xe2\x80\x94 but with Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s support, the broader team began to coalesce. They met under Schuster\xe2\x80\x99s command on Wednesdays at 2 p.m. in a corner room of the Brain building called Quartz Lake. The meeting was generally attended by a rotating cast of more than a dozen people. When Hughes or Corrado were there, they were usually the only native English speakers. The engineers spoke Chinese, Vietnamese, Polish, Russian, Arabic, German and Japanese, though they mostly spoke in their own efficient pidgin and in math. It is not always totally clear, at Google, who is running a meeting, but in Schuster\xe2\x80\x99s case there was no ambiguity.'b'The steps they needed to take, even then, were not wholly clear. \xe2\x80\x9cThis story is a lot about uncertainty \xe2\x80\x94 uncertainty throughout the whole process,\xe2\x80\x9d Schuster told me at one point. \xe2\x80\x9cThe software, the data, the hardware, the people. It was like\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 he extended his long, gracile arms, slightly bent at the elbows, from his narrow shoulders \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cswimming in a big sea of mud, and you can only see this far.\xe2\x80\x9d He held out his hand eight inches in front of his chest. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a goal somewhere, and maybe it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Most of Google\xe2\x80\x99s conference rooms have videochat monitors, which when idle display extremely high-resolution oversaturated public Google+ photos of a sylvan dreamscape or the northern lights or the Reichstag. Schuster gestured toward one of the panels, which showed a crystalline still of the Washington Monument at night.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe view from outside is that everyone has binoculars and can see ahead so far.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The theoretical work to get them to this point had already been painstaking and drawn-out, but the attempt to turn it into a viable product \xe2\x80\x94 the part that academic scientists might dismiss as \xe2\x80\x9cmere\xe2\x80\x9d engineering \xe2\x80\x94 was no less difficult. For one thing, they needed to make sure that they were training on good data. Google\xe2\x80\x99s billions of words of training \xe2\x80\x9creading\xe2\x80\x9d were mostly made up of complete sentences of moderate complexity, like the sort of thing you might find in Hemingway. Some of this is in the public domain: The original Rosetta Stone of statistical machine translation was millions of pages of the complete bilingual records of the Canadian Parliament. Much of it, however, was culled from 10 years of collected data, including human translations that were crowdsourced from enthusiastic respondents. The team had in their storehouse about 97 million unique English \xe2\x80\x9cwords.\xe2\x80\x9d But once they removed the emoticons, and the misspellings, and the redundancies, they had a working vocabulary of only around 160,000.'b'Then you had to refocus on what users actually wanted to translate, which frequently had very little to do with reasonable language as it is employed. Many people, Google had found, don\xe2\x80\x99t look to the service to translate full, complex sentences; they translate weird little shards of language. If you wanted the network to be able to handle the stream of user queries, you had to be sure to orient it in that direction. The network was very sensitive to the data it was trained on. As Hughes put it to me at one point: \xe2\x80\x9cThe neural-translation system is learning everything it can. It\xe2\x80\x99s like a toddler. \xe2\x80\x98Oh, Daddy says that word when he\xe2\x80\x99s mad!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d He laughed. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to be careful.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'More than anything, though, they needed to make sure that the whole thing was fast and reliable enough that their users wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t notice. In February, the translation of a 10-word sentence took 10 seconds. They could never introduce anything that slow. The Translate team began to conduct latency experiments on a small percentage of users, in the form of faked delays, to identify tolerance. They found that a translation that took twice as long, or even five times as long, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be registered. An eightfold slowdown would. They didn\xe2\x80\x99t need to make sure this was true across all languages. In the case of a high-traffic language, like French or Chinese, they could countenance virtually no slowdown. For something more obscure, they knew that users wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be so scared off by a slight delay if they were getting better quality. They just wanted to prevent people from giving up and switching over to some competitor\xe2\x80\x99s service.'b'Schuster, for his part, admitted he just didn\xe2\x80\x99t know if they ever could make it fast enough. He remembers a conversation in the microkitchen during which he turned to Chen and said, \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be something we don\xe2\x80\x99t know to make it fast enough, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what it could be.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'He did know, though, that they needed more computers \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cG.P.U.s,\xe2\x80\x9d graphics processors reconfigured for neural networks \xe2\x80\x94 for training.'b'Hughes went to Schuster to ask what he thought. \xe2\x80\x9cShould we ask for a thousand G.P.U.s?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Schuster said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhy not 2,000?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Ten days later, they had the additional 2,000 processors.'b'By April, the original lineup of three had become more than 30 people \xe2\x80\x94 some of them, like Le, on the Brain side, and many from Translate. In May, Hughes assigned a kind of provisional owner to each language pair, and they all checked their results into a big shared spreadsheet of performance evaluations. At any given time, at least 20 people were running their own independent weeklong experiments and dealing with whatever unexpected problems came up. One day a model, for no apparent reason, started taking all the numbers it came across in a sentence and discarding them. There were months when it was all touch and go. \xe2\x80\x9cPeople were almost yelling,\xe2\x80\x9d Schuster said.'b'By late spring, the various pieces were coming together. The team introduced something called a \xe2\x80\x9cword-piece model,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9clength normalization.\xe2\x80\x9d Each part improved the results, Schuster says, by maybe a few percentage points, but in aggregate they had significant effects. Once the model was standardized, it would be only a single multilingual model that would improve over time, rather than the 150 different models that Translate currently used. Still, the paradox \xe2\x80\x94 that a tool built to further generalize, via learning machines, the process of automation required such an extraordinary amount of concerted human ingenuity and effort \xe2\x80\x94 was not lost on them. So much of what they did was just gut. How many neurons per layer did you use? 1,024 or 512? How many layers? How many sentences did you run through at a time? How long did you train for?'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe did hundreds of experiments,\xe2\x80\x9d Schuster told me, \xe2\x80\x9cuntil we knew that we could stop the training after one week. You\xe2\x80\x99re always saying: When do we stop? How do I know I\xe2\x80\x99m done? You never know you\xe2\x80\x99re done. The machine-learning mechanism is never perfect. You need to train, and at some point you have to stop. That\xe2\x80\x99s the very painful nature of this whole system. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard for some people. It\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit an art \xe2\x80\x94 where you put your brush to make it nice. It comes from just doing it. Some people are better, some worse.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'By May, the Brain team understood that the only way they were ever going to make the system fast enough to implement as a product was if they could run it on T.P.U.s, the special-purpose chips that Dean had called for. As Chen put it: \xe2\x80\x9cWe did not even know if the code would work. But we did know that without T.P.U.s, it 'b'definitely'b' wasn\xe2\x80\x99t going to work.\xe2\x80\x9d He remembers going to Dean one on one to plead, \xe2\x80\x9cPlease reserve something for us.\xe2\x80\x9d Dean had reserved them. The T.P.U.s, however, didn\xe2\x80\x99t work right out of the box. Wu spent two months sitting next to someone from the hardware team in an attempt to figure out why. They weren\xe2\x80\x99t just debugging the model; they were debugging the chip. The neural-translation project would be proof of concept for the whole infrastructural investment.'b'One Wednesday in June, the meeting in Quartz Lake began with murmurs about 'b'a Baidu paper'b' that had recently appeared on the discipline\xe2\x80\x99s chief online forum. Schuster brought the room to order. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, Baidu came out with a paper. It feels like someone looking through our shoulder \xe2\x80\x94 similar architecture, similar results.\xe2\x80\x9d The company\xe2\x80\x99s BLEU scores were essentially what Google achieved in its internal tests in February and March. Le didn\xe2\x80\x99t seem ruffled; his conclusion seemed to be that it was a sign Google was on the right track. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is very similar to our system,\xe2\x80\x9d he said with quiet approval.'b'The Google team knew that they could have published their results earlier and perhaps beaten their competitors, but as Schuster put it: \xe2\x80\x9cLaunching is more important than publishing. People say, \xe2\x80\x98Oh, I did something first,\xe2\x80\x99 but who cares, in the end?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'This did, however, make it imperative that they get their own service out first and better. Hughes had a fantasy that they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t even inform their users of the switch. They would just wait and see if social media lit up with suspicions about the vast improvements.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say it\xe2\x80\x99s a new system yet,\xe2\x80\x9d he told me at 5:36 p.m. two days after Labor Day, one minute before they rolled out Chinese-to-English to 10 percent of their users, without telling anyone. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want to make sure it works. The ideal is that it\xe2\x80\x99s exploding on Twitter: \xe2\x80\x98Have you seen how awesome Google Translate got?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The only two reliable measures of time in the seasonless Silicon Valley are the rotations of seasonal fruit in the microkitchens \xe2\x80\x94 from the pluots of midsummer to the Asian pears and Fuyu persimmons of early fall \xe2\x80\x94 and the zigzag of technological progress. On an almost uncomfortably warm Monday afternoon in late September, the team\xe2\x80\x99s paper was 'b'at last released.'b' It had an almost comical 31 authors. The next day, the members of Brain and Translate gathered to throw themselves a little celebratory reception in the Translate microkitchen. The rooms in the Brain building, perhaps in homage to the long winters of their diaspora, are named after Alaskan locales; the Translate building\xe2\x80\x99s theme is Hawaiian.'b'The Hawaiian microkitchen has a slightly grainy beach photograph on one wall, a small lei-garlanded thatched-hut service counter with a stuffed parrot at the center and ceiling fixtures fitted to resemble paper lanterns. Two sparse histograms of bamboo poles line the sides, like the posts of an ill-defended tropical fort. Beyond the bamboo poles, glass walls and doors open onto rows of identical gray desks on either side. That morning had seen the arrival of new hooded sweatshirts to honor 10 years of Translate, and many team members went over to the party from their desks in their new gear. They were in part celebrating the fact that their decade of collective work was, as of that day, en route to retirement. At another institution, these new hoodies might thus have become a costume of bereavement, but the engineers and computer scientists from both teams all seemed pleased.'b'Google\xe2\x80\x99s neural translation was at last working. By the time of the party, the company\xe2\x80\x99s Chinese-English test had already processed 18 million queries. One engineer on the Translate team was running around with his phone out, trying to translate entire sentences from Chinese to English using Baidu\xe2\x80\x99s alternative. He crowed with glee to anybody who would listen. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you put in more than two characters at once, it times out!\xe2\x80\x9d (Baidu says this problem has never been reported by users.)'b'When word began to spread, over the following weeks, that Google had introduced neural translation for Chinese to English, some people speculated that it was because that was the only language pair for which the company had decent results. Everybody at the party knew that the reality of their achievement would be clear in November. By then, however, many of them would be on to other projects.'b'Hughes cleared his throat and stepped in front of the tiki bar. He wore a faded green polo with a rumpled collar, lightly patterned across the midsection with dark bands of drying sweat. There had been last-minute problems, and then last-last-minute problems, including a very big measurement error in the paper and a weird punctuation-related bug in the system. But everything was resolved \xe2\x80\x94 or at least sufficiently resolved for the moment. The guests quieted. Hughes ran efficient and productive meetings, with a low tolerance for maundering or side conversation, but he was given pause by the gravity of the occasion. He acknowledged that he was, perhaps, stretching a metaphor, but it was important to him to underline the fact, he began, that the neural translation project itself represented a \xe2\x80\x9ccollaboration between groups that spoke different languages.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Their neural-translation project, he continued, represented a \xe2\x80\x9cstep function forward\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x94 that is, a discontinuous advance, a vertical leap rather than a smooth curve. The relevant translation had been not just between the two teams but from theory into reality. He raised a plastic demi-flute of expensive-looking Champagne.'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo communication,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cand cooperation!\xe2\x80\x9d'b'The engineers assembled looked around at one another and gave themselves over to little circumspect whoops and applause.'b'Jeff Dean stood near the center of the microkitchen, his hands in his pockets, shoulders hunched slightly inward, with Corrado and Schuster. Dean saw that there was some diffuse preference that he contribute to the observance of the occasion, and he did so in a characteristically understated manner, with a light, rapid, concise addendum.'b'What they had shown, Dean said, was that they could do two major things at once: \xe2\x80\x9cDo the research and get it in front of, I dunno, half a billion people.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Everyone laughed, not because it was an exaggeration but because it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t.'b'Perhaps the most famous historic critique of artificial intelligence, or the claims made on its behalf, implicates the question of translation. The Chinese Room argument was proposed in 1980 by the Berkeley philosopher John Searle. In Searle\xe2\x80\x99s thought experiment, a monolingual English speaker sits alone in a cell. An unseen jailer passes him, through a slot in the door, slips of paper marked with Chinese characters. The prisoner has been given a set of tables and rules in English for the composition of replies. He becomes so adept with these instructions that his answers are soon \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely indistinguishable from those of Chinese speakers.\xe2\x80\x9d Should the unlucky prisoner be said to \xe2\x80\x9cunderstand\xe2\x80\x9d Chinese? Searle thought the answer was obviously not. This metaphor for a computer, Searle later wrote, exploded the claim that \xe2\x80\x9cthe appropriately programmed digital computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the sense that human beings have minds.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'For the Google Brain team, though, or for nearly everyone else who works in machine learning in Silicon Valley, that view is entirely beside the point. This doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean they\xe2\x80\x99re just ignoring the philosophical question. It means they have a fundamentally different view of the mind. Unlike Searle, they don\xe2\x80\x99t assume that \xe2\x80\x9cconsciousness\xe2\x80\x9d is some special, numinously glowing mental attribute \xe2\x80\x94 what the philosopher Gilbert Ryle called the \xe2\x80\x9cghost in the machine.\xe2\x80\x9d They just believe instead that the complex assortment of skills we call \xe2\x80\x9cconsciousness\xe2\x80\x9d has randomly emerged from the coordinated activity of many different simple mechanisms. The implication is that our facility with what we consider the higher registers of thought are no different in kind from what we\xe2\x80\x99re tempted to perceive as the lower registers. Logical reasoning, on this account, is seen as a lucky adaptation; so is the ability to throw and catch a ball. Artificial intelligence is not about building a mind; it\xe2\x80\x99s about the improvement of tools to solve problems. As Corrado said to me on my very first day at Google, \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about what a machine \xe2\x80\x98knows\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98understands\xe2\x80\x99 but what it \xe2\x80\x98does,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x94 more importantly \xe2\x80\x94 what it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do yet.\xe2\x80\x9d'b'Where you come down on \xe2\x80\x9cknowing\xe2\x80\x9d versus \xe2\x80\x9cdoing\xe2\x80\x9d has real cultural and social implications. At the party, Schuster came over to me to express his frustration with the paper\xe2\x80\x99s media reception. \xe2\x80\x9cDid you see the first press?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked me. He paraphrased a headline from that morning, blocking it word by word with his hand as he recited it: GOOGLE SAYS A.I. TRANSLATION IS INDISTINGUISHABLE FROM HUMANS\xe2\x80\x99. Over the final weeks of the paper\xe2\x80\x99s composition, the team had struggled with this; Schuster often repeated that the message of the paper was \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much better than it was before, but not as good as humans.\xe2\x80\x9d He had hoped it would be clear that their efforts weren\xe2\x80\x99t about replacing people but helping them.'b'And yet the rise of machine learning makes it more difficult for us to carve out a special place for us. If you believe, with Searle, that there is something special about human \xe2\x80\x9cinsight,\xe2\x80\x9d you can draw a clear line that separates the human from the automated. If you agree with Searle\xe2\x80\x99s antagonists, you can\xe2\x80\x99t. It is understandable why so many people cling fast to the former view. At a 2015 M.I.T. conference about the roots of artificial intelligence, Noam Chomsky was asked what he thought of machine learning. He pooh-poohed the whole enterprise as mere statistical prediction, a glorified weather forecast. Even if neural translation attained perfect functionality, it would reveal nothing profound about the underlying nature of language. It could never tell you if a pronoun took the dative or the accusative case. This kind of prediction makes for a good tool to accomplish our ends, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t succeed by the standards of furthering our understanding of why things happen the way they do. A machine can already detect tumors in medical scans better than human radiologists, but the machine can\xe2\x80\x99t tell you what\xe2\x80\x99s causing the cancer.'b'Then again, can the radiologist?'b'Medical diagnosis is one field most immediately, and perhaps unpredictably, threatened by machine learning. Radiologists are extensively trained and extremely well paid, and we think of their skill as one of professional insight \xe2\x80\x94 the highest register of thought. In the past year alone, researchers have shown not only that neural networks can find tumors in medical images much earlier than their human counterparts but also that machines can even make such diagnoses from the texts of pathology reports. What radiologists do turns out to be something much closer to predictive pattern-matching than logical analysis. They\xe2\x80\x99re not telling you what caused the cancer; they\xe2\x80\x99re just telling you it\xe2\x80\x99s there.'b'Once you\xe2\x80\x99ve built a robust pattern-matching apparatus for one purpose, it can be tweaked in the service of others. One Translate engineer took a network he put together to judge artwork and used it to drive an autonomous radio-controlled car. A network built to recognize a cat can be turned around and trained on CT scans \xe2\x80\x94 and on infinitely more examples than even the best doctor could ever review. A neural network built to translate could work through millions of pages of documents of legal discovery in the tiniest fraction of the time it would take the most expensively credentialed lawyer. The kinds of jobs taken by automatons will no longer be just repetitive tasks that were once \xe2\x80\x94 unfairly, it ought to be emphasized \xe2\x80\x94 associated with the supposed lower intelligence of the uneducated classes. We\xe2\x80\x99re not only talking about three and a half million truck drivers who may soon lack careers. We\xe2\x80\x99re talking about inventory managers, economists, financial advisers, real estate agents. What Brain did over nine months is just one example of how quickly a small group at a large company can automate a task nobody ever would have associated with machines.'b'The most important thing happening in Silicon Valley right now is not disruption. Rather, it\xe2\x80\x99s institution-building \xe2\x80\x94 and the consolidation of power \xe2\x80\x94 on a scale and at a pace that are both probably unprecedented in human history. Brain has interns; it has residents; it has \xe2\x80\x9cninja\xe2\x80\x9d classes to train people in other departments. Everywhere there are bins of free bike helmets, and free green umbrellas for the two days a year it rains, and little fruit salads, and nap pods, and shared treadmill desks, and massage chairs, and random cartons of high-end pastries, and places for baby-clothes donations, and two-story climbing walls with scheduled instructors, and reading groups and policy talks and variegated support networks. The recipients of these major investments in human cultivation \xe2\x80\x94 for they\xe2\x80\x99re far more than perks for proles in some digital salt mine \xe2\x80\x94 have at hand the power of complexly coordinated servers distributed across 13 data centers on four continents, data centers that draw enough electricity to light up large cities.'b'But even enormous institutions like Google will be subject to this wave of automation; once machines can learn from human speech, even the comfortable job of the programmer is threatened. As the party in the tiki bar was winding down, a Translate engineer brought over his laptop to show Hughes something. The screen swirled and pulsed with a vivid, kaleidoscopic animation of brightly colored spheres in long looping orbits that periodically collapsed into nebulae before dispersing once more.'b'Hughes recognized what it was right away, but I had to look closely before I saw all the names \xe2\x80\x94 of people and files. It was an animation of the history of 10 years of changes to the Translate code base, every single buzzing and blooming contribution by every last team member. Hughes reached over gently to skip forward, from 2006 to 2008 to 2015, stopping every once in a while to pause and remember some distant campaign, some ancient triumph or catastrophe that now hurried by to be absorbed elsewhere or to burst on its own. Hughes pointed out how often Jeff Dean\xe2\x80\x99s name expanded here and there in glowing spheres.'b'Hughes called over Corrado, and they stood transfixed. To break the spell of melancholic nostalgia, Corrado, looking a little wounded, looked up and said, \xe2\x80\x9cSo when do we get to delete it?\xe2\x80\x9d'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t worry about it,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe new code base is going to grow. Everything grows.\xe2\x80\x9d'b''b''b''b''
